4,I bought the 15 x 70 regular version (there is a Pro version) from Amazon's Used inventory. The first pair that I ordered didn't really arrive -- only the Celestron Box!!! Whether or not they were shipped as an empty box were stolen along the way or slipped out while enroute I will never know. Amazon did refund me promptly. I immediately ordered another pair again used in reported "very good" condition. They look brand new so I'm excited with the potential. Collimation or lack of is a common problem with these binoculars that have superior ratings IF you can get a pair without collimation problems or adjust them yourself.Mine had the notorious double image on both terrestrial objects and on Jupiter. I located the adjustment screw(s). You DO NOT have to damage the grip covering to reach the screws. Just simply carefully pry up the grip enough (see YouTube videos) enough to expose the screws. I just adjusted one of the two screws on one side and got them working excellently for terrestrial objects hundreds of yards away. The moon is fine. Jupiter I'm still working on. Sometimes it is fine but then I get double vision again. When I checked with Celestron I was told that it costs $93 plus shipping (to/fr California) to have them do the Collimation if the binocs are not warrantied (mine are used) or beyond 30 days on a warrantied pair. That is way more than I would pay. I'm going to keep working on Jupiter and probably keep these as the images are fantastic of the moon and terrestrial. I can see Jupiter and three of its 4 usually visible moons. I'm hoping that I can get the collimation set and I will then know that I can maintain it myself which is good to know how to do for any of these model binocs that may go out down the line.
5,Great for stargazing! The binos arrived a few days ago well-packaged and perfectly collimated. It took less than 2 minutes to adjust them to my preference. And then they opened up the stars! They are definitely heavy so if you have no intention of getting a tripod and you aren't unusually strong OR steady-handed you will either want a  tripod (more on that at the end) OR to get a smaller less heavy pair. I wanted that extra bit of power so I'm happy I chose these and I added a tripod and adaptor to my order.In my about-30% light-polluted mostly-rural sky I was able to clearly separate the 2 "fried eggs" of the Orion Nebula pick out the double and triple stars in the Sword and even find an intriguing fourth stick-figure star group right on top of the Sword that nobody online seems to ever mention. The hilt?In fact the Sword and Belt of Orion were so spectacular in these binos that I had trouble taking my eyes off of them. I could NOT separate the double-stars in the Belt nor did I get any hint of the Nebulas that are supposed to be right near the last star in the Belt but I was able to pick out quite a few star clusters. The Pleiades looks wonderful as you can just capture all of them in one shot as with most star clusters. I could easily pick out two planets in the sky (update: the second "planet" turned out to be the star Sirius) but no good detail. I'm not sure if the really bright one was Saturn or Jupiter (update: it was Jupiter) but the Binos helped me pick out a sparkling belt of (moons?) around it and it was stunning. I guess NO Binocular in this weight class is going to give you any detail on the planets nebula or allow you to do much more than get a faint fuzzy glimpse of a galaxy. But if you are happy just knowing you found something even if it's not like the pictures this is a really good option. I did NOT get the moon yet so I don't know how that will look but I suspect it will be amazing.As far as quality it seems pretty good for the money. It comes with easy-on/off caps to protect the front and back ends and as noted above adjusting them is very easy. And they stay adjusted too! That surprised me given how easy they are to adjust in the first place. Optics are about what you'd expect at this price point but I'll say that I was very impressed with how sharp and clear the stars were and how much detail I was able to get out of them. The outside has a rubber coating on it which would provide a little protection if they were banged or dropped (UPDATE: and so they did). They do have some plastic on them but it doesn't really come off as cheaply-made. My set came with a nice little carrying bag (that I will totally use) a cleaning cloth and the aforementioned caps.These will be used regularly even if I end up with an actual telescope. They are strong enough to scan the sky and pick out interesting areas but have a wide-enough field of vision to use for spotting. After my first star party I confirmed that some sky sights are actually better in these binoculars than in a telescope! I had a few telescope owners oohing at the sights from my binos (which I oohed over the extra detail available in their scopes!).Important note: Do NOT buy the Davis Vista tripod suggested by Amazon without doing some research first! The low $25 price if it's the same one they recommended to me also means that it's not actually built to support the weight of these binos - that tripod is not built for astronomy use. It's very hard to get these binos to hold still with the $25 tripod Amazon wants you to buy and trying to look upwards is very difficult. If your budget allows look for a heavier tripod that can support more weight and can be solidly locked even when the binos are on a tilt or tilted back. I think you should look for (if you can afford it):  The TALLEST tripod you can get your hands on. You'd have to be like 5' tall to find 60" acceptable for stargazing.  A tripod that can handle at least 10 pounds of weight with no problem (so you can lock the binos in place).  A tripod with good support - you'll be tilting the binoculars constantly up down and sideways and picking up the tripod frequently and moving it all around so support really matters.  The lightest tripod you can find that meets the above qualities. Again you'll probably be picking it up a LOT and moving it around.I don't unfortunately have any suggestions yet - I will be asking the Astronomy Club I just joined as soon as I can for ideas. However I'm pretty certain that you'll drop at least $75 into an appropriate tripod for these Celestron 15 x 70s so... if your budget is tight the cheaper tripod might be low-cost enough to be worth the irritation as they will nevertheless steady up the binos at least enough to improve your view of the stars.**UPDATE a week later! My beautiful new binoculars FACE-PLANTED from the above-mentioned tripod right onto the concrete at my first star party a fall of about six feet total with time to accelerate. Thunk omg yikes.THEY SURVIVED THE FALL. I picked them up and was able to see fine out of them. It's possible the collimation is now slightly off but I couldn't notice a difference.I can't give the SkyMasters another star as I'm already at 5/5 but I would if I could. All they got was a few scratches. WOW. I don't recommend dropping them on solid concrete as a rule mind you - and I might have just gotten lucky - but it's a huge comfort to know that they CAN survive that sort of thing. I won't always have the luxury of using these on soft ground.(I also found a Ravelli APGL heavy-duty tripod at about $70 that should be able to handle a lot more weight and will discontinue use of this "lightweight" tripod once it arrives. Lesson learned and I'm only out about $25 from it and these wonderful binos lived so it could all be worse.)
4,Very nice binoculars.  I can see a LOT more stars helps with light polluted areas.  And even the stars I can see with the naked eye this brings them much closer.  In my area I can barely see the Little Dipper but in these binoculars they shine like jewels.  They are a little heavy and take a steady hand and/or a tripod.  The tripod mount was easy to use and gives a similar experience to using a telescope.  I really enjoy seeing the night sky with the naked eye and these binoculars can add to that experience.  I will mention something lighter/smaller might be what some people would rather have.  I have tried very small binoculars for night viewing before and I would rather have these 15x70's than a pair of very small binoculars.
4,I just got these and also the 25x70 pair for comparison. These seem to be okay binocs for entry level viewing of the moon and planets. By day they have an odd cloudy ring around the image edge - I assume from the inexpensive optics. By night they seem okay for moon viewing though they were not true to color making the moon more yellow than it is. Eye relief is excellent and makes them a better choice than the 25x70s where eye relief was unacceptably short. I got these on sale at $75 which makes me think I might keep them. They were collimated perfectly unlike the 25x pair. It leaves me wondering though maybe the 20x80 pair would be a perfect balance - a bit better magnification and yet enough eye relief for night viewing. There's a significant price bump for the 20x80s so at $75 these are a decent value and a good pair for kicking around with without too much worry of ruining a high end pair of binocs.
5,gave to my wife as a gift and she was thrilled whith them. we own a celestron Edge HD 9.25 wich is a nice telescope but with this we have the liberty to move around and get some great views otherwise not possible whith the telescope since we live in a suburb and our views are block by trees and houses this are sharp crisp and clear...excellent.
5,First off I have 4 children who are just as fascinated with the stars moon & planets as I am. So it all started with a $29.99Â   Meade 20218 NG-70SM 70MM Altazimuth Refractor Telescope         in a 'last chance' 1/2 off sale at a 'fancy' chain gadget store. One full moon later and the sudden realization that there aren't enough eyepieces for eyes who want to see changed everything. One beginner 'scope wasn't enough-so I ordered another directly from Meade AZ70-A (identical optics but even lower tech than the 'firesale' purchase). Great addition as it 'had' everything that the original scope didn't but- still too many frustrated viewers and not enough views to go around fast enough!New tactics: Binoculars will work! I ordered up a variety of sizes (and quality) and now I have a pretty good idea of why these Celstron SkyMaster 15x70's are the clear winner for us. Great optics easy to use 'smallest' of SuperGiant binoculars (easy to hold view & can be left around your neck for a little while without chaffing). Also these balance almost perfectly on the included tripod mount-which means that aÂ   Zeikos ZE-TR101A 72-Inch Photo / Video Tripod includes Deluxe Carrying Case for Use with Most Camcorders and Digital cameras.        can easily carry the load without fear of tipping over.So the real answer to 'what is the best?' is what gets the most use. I have a really beautiful fully functionalÂ   Meade DS-2114AT-TC Altazimuth Reflector        Â that works so nice and is a wonder to use but compared to the 15x70's-it's rarely used. Zhummel 20x80's- awesome optics- but in order to 'find' anything you really must use the tripod because of it's small field of view and shakiness after holding them up by hand for a few minutes. (4.4LBS starts to become very noticable when you are holding your arms above your heart for a while!)  Cosmos 15x60 Waterproof Binocular with Premium Carry Case        Â come in 2nd right behind the SkyMasters because they are slightly heavier and they don't 'look' like stargazing Binocs- blunt fat heavy when near the SkyMasters-although extremely great binoculars- explain that to the kids! The Celstron's 'feel' right they 'look' right they're smooth to focus (another reason the Barska's lose-individual EP focus is required!) can be used briefly before your arms get tired. Just long enough to know if you're going to grab a tripod another pair & maybe the big 'dumb' telescope theÂ   Meade 20218 NG-70SM 70MM Altazimuth Refractor Telescope        Â which everyone is comfortable using is properly sited with the red dot & has a sweetÂ   Celestron 93230 8 to 24mm 1.25 Zoom Eyepiece         a multicoated 3X Barlow & great manual slow motion controls.The SkyMasters actually reside in the kitchen-on top of the cabinets closest to the door so anyone can use them on really short notice! Deer in the side yard? Blue Angels over at the AFB using our shed again as a meet up point? The neighbors have a real Ferrari (or is it a kit car based on the Pontiac Fiero 2M4) in thier driveway? All other optics live in my master bedroom closet and require permission for use (and on the nicer stuff-adult supervision). But @ $51.00 delivered to my door-nothing comes close in price fit & finish optics/$$'s spent & ease of use.This sounds a little crazy but I'm going to put it out there. These binoculars are also beautiful to the eye they feel properly weighted are rock solid (yes my 7 year old dropped them but 'it was an accident!') and have kept their collimation over time. My only modifications are individual eyepiece covers & a wide orange neoprene neck strap. The soft bag has held up the lens covers are still used and kept in the bag with a lens cleaning towelette. Why Orange for the neck strap? I can yell out the window and gently 'remind' my kids to put it on when they're using the binoculars-orange is really quite visible-even in fading light. FYI I leave the tripod mount attached to one of the quick release plates-and leave it on the tripod all of the time. It;s used so often it gets it's own 'dedicated' $23.99 tripod and nothing gets lost-because it's always mounted.Buy them! Use them with abandon-all day & all night long! Do buy a tripod for stargazing-it's the only way my partner got interested. "Honey check this out" all focused in in the center of the field of view. Yes I had to do it often to get her started but now she's willing to supervise 'ours' their friends & neighborhood kids (at any given time) and doesn't even mind lugging out the variety of inexpensive telescopes & tripods as well as other pairs of binocs when the crowd swells.Update: After multiple months of constant use by adults & children-they slipped out of collimation slightly. Sadly there is very little information contained in the owners manual (napkins would be more helpful!) however a long web search and reading a variety of sources mulpitle times I have 'tried' to adjust the internal prisms ever so slightly-without creating cat's eye exit apetures. I have now created 'conditional alignment' instead of proper collimation but-both my partner & I can use these without developing eyestrain. So they continue to provide constant & reliable service-again at a very moderate price. Also they are still the 1st optics out the door-every time. Easy to use easy to set up quick to break down- 15 minutes is all that is needed for a 'viewing' session & enjoyment. Please note: these are not Fujinons or Swarowski optics- and just provide increased magnification for the majority of the field of view! Don't expect perfection just use & enjoy your 'value priced' binoculars!
5,The SkyMasters arrived carefully packed and collimated.  One negative I noted is the narrow neckstrap included.  It's much too small for a pair of binos this size and I'm sure it would leave a "rope burn" on the back of my neck if I use it.  To correct this I removed the MUCH BEEFIER strap from my old Jason 10 x 50s and attached it to the new SkyMasters.  Problem solved.The other negative is the flimsy nylon carrying case.  I would prefer to have a hard carrying case to help prevent the binos from being bumped out of collimation during storage and transit.  For this reason alone I considered giving the SkyMasters four out of five stars but this issue isn't related to the performance of the product itself.Many reviewers have commented on the weight of the SkyMasters.  Yes they are definitely heavier than my 10 x 50s but I expected them to be much heavier.  They are surprisingly easy to hand-hold.  Those folks who have difficulty with the weight may find it easier to hold the barrels near the objective lens to distribute the weight evenly.My first night using them outside was a real treat as I did a quick star test to determine star color accuracy and brightness.  I looked at three of my favorite stars - Deneb Sadr and Mirfak.  I swing the binos up to the northwest and check out first-magnitude Deneb (1425 light years away) in the constellation Cygnus.  It's a rare A2Ia (white-hot supergiant) star about 108 - 114 times the size of our sun shining with an astounding luminosity of 54400 suns!!!  It marks the top of the Northern Cross in Cygnus.  If Deneb was put in place of our sun right this moment earth would be roasted instantly!!  Through the SkyMasters Deneb appears as a brilliantly-bright sharply-focused white point of light!  Magnificent!Just below Deneb in the same constellation I scan down to mid-second-magnitude Sadr (1830 light years distant) an F8Iab (yellow-white-hot supergiant) star nearly the same color and temperature as our sun but an enormous 183 times larger shining with a fierce luminosity of 60000 suns!!!  The SkyMasters reveal Sadr's beautiful light yellow hue.  Stunning!Now I swing over to the northeast and up to check out second-magnitude Mirfak (590 light years away) the brightest star in the constellation Perseus.  It's an F5Ib (yellow-white-hot supergiant) 62 times the size of our sun and 5000 times brighter.  Mirfak appears similar in brightness and color to the yellowish-white light of a car headlight seen about 1/2 mile in the distance by the unaided eye.  Impressive!Since the bright first-magnitude star Capella is nearby in the constellation Auriga I pan over a short distance to the left.  Actually Capella is a binary star system consisting of a G8III (yellow-orange-hot giant) and G0III (yellow-hot giant) star in very close mutual orbit around each other.  The combined light of both stars is similar in brightness to the yellowish-white light of a car headlight seen about 1/4 mile in the distance by the unaided eye.  Very bright indeed!To really appreciate the light-gathering ability of the Celestrons first look at your favorite stars with your old binos.  Then view them through the SkyMasters.  The star brightness from 50mm to 70mm aperture is substantial and is enhanced by the SkyMaster's BAK-4 prisms.  What I once thought was bright with my Jason 10 x 50s with lower-quality BK-7 prisms now is dim compared to the SkyMasters!The SkyMaster's 4.4-degree field of view can make it a bit challenging to locate a star unless you're familiar with the constellations and know the location of the star and its color.  I found that aiming the SkyMasters in the general direction of the star placing them to your eyes and raising them up a little higher will place the star in the field of view.The center focus dial and right diopter eyepiece rotate smoothly through their full range of motion and are easy to turn even with winter gloves on.  I didn't detect any tightness or looseness in either dial.Because of their weight and higher magnification there is a considerable amount of "star dancing" when viewing a star with the SkyMasters.  This annoyance is much more pronounced than it is with my 10 x 50s.  Previous reviewers have touched upon this as well and have remedied the problem with a tripod.  I'm still trying to find other ways (if there are any) of steadying the SkyMasters short of purchasing a tripod.  I want to maximize the SkyMaster's "ultimate portability" by swinging them from one area of the sky to another rapidly to compare star colors and brightness without having to move and re-station a tripod over and over again.There you have it the biggest advantage of the SkyMasters - ultimate portability!  I've had two telscopes in the past but got rid of them both.  Wasting time setting up the scope fishing around trying to locate a star then seeing a fuzzy "blob" with one eye closed once I did find the star wasn't fun.  Let's not forget having to tear down the scope and store it away!  More time wasted.Now if I want to check out a few of my favorite stars after supper on a winter night - no problem!  Just throw on a parka hat and gloves grab the Skymasters and step out in the back yard for a quick view.  Ahh Wezen sure looks beautiful tonight!
5,Love these binoculars.  They are longer than a standard 10x50 (ofcourse) but I don't find them heavy.  The "strap" it comes with is not as pictured and very thin.  I would not use it.  I used a neoprene camera strap instead.  These were easy to focus and find my IDP.  No glasses needed for presbyopia but the eyecups do accommodate them.  I would recommend the Celestron brand and purchase again.  No eye fatigue just a clear picture!
5,This posting begins with a discussion of some core information about binoculars for astronomical viewing that may help potential purchasers make a more informed purchase decision.If you have other viewing objectives than astronomical objects or are already familiar with binocular specifications you may want to stop here or just read the latter part of this review before going on to other postings; otherwise read-on.There are two models often used in astronomy roof prisms or Porro prisms binoculars. Roof prisms are more modern and have a straight through appearance i.e. the binocular cylinders form straight tubes. Porro prism binoculars (named after Ignazio Porro) have a tell-tale right angle bend. These usually are manufactured with two prism on each side of the binoculars i.e. double Porro prisms. Although considerably larger in size because of their improved optical qualities Porro prism binoculars such as the model reviewed here are usually preferred over roof prism binoculars for astronomical viewing.Another important aspect of binoculars is the size of their exit pupil. Younger folks have pupils that can open dilate to a maximum size of slightly over 7mm. However as one gets older the size of this window into the eye reduces. Over the age of thirty most folks have a reduction in their dark adapted pupil size of approximately 1mm every 20 years. The exit pupils for a pair of binoculars should ideally approximate the entry pupil of the observer's eye. Some suggest an even smaller exit pupil size see below. The size of a binoculars' exit pupil is found by dividing aperture by magnification. For example common 7 x 50 binoculars (7 power by 50mm) have an exit pupil of approximately 7.14mm. In practice this exit pupil size is larger than many adult's dark-adapted pupil size particularly when some extraneous light is also present. In most viewing environments such as in or near a city such extraneous "light pollution" is almost always present. In addition the periphery of the eye's lens exhibits some inherent optical degradation. Thus an exit pupil size around 5mm may be preferred although some experimental evidence suggests an exit pupil even less than 4mm may be most appropriate. These 15 x 70mm binoculars have an exit pupil of approximately 4.7mm resulting in more of the light exiting the lenses entering the eye than might occur with e.g. 7 x 50mm binoculars.Possibly the most important consideration when choosing binoculars is their light gathering ability. Binoculars are essentially "light buckets". As noted the human eye at its widest has about a 7mm entry window. A 70mm objective lenses as here has over 50 times the light gathering area of the human eye. Another factor affecting the light transmitted through binoculars are the materials used in their lenses and prisms and their lens coatings. The least expensive binoculars have uncoated lenses or single coated lenses or may even use plastic lenses. Multi-coated binocular lenses and BaK-4 barium crown glass prisms as in these Celestrons are typically more expensive but improve light transmission resulting in sharper and  brighter images.The best eye relief i.e. the eyes' distance behind the exit pupil to see the full exit image is probably between 15mm and 20mm. These binoculars provide 18mm and additionally come with rubber eye-cups. Thus I've been able to use these both with and without glasses. I use lightly tinted sunglasses when viewing the moon to see more detail.  In that case I leave the eyecups down.  When viewing without glasses I leave the eye-cups up.In use I've found these binoculars' images sharp and with adequate contrast to enjoy star clusters such as the Hyades and Pleiades along with the moon and planetary observations.  Its primary negatives are its size and  weight. This pair is large although slightly smaller at 11 x 9 inches than the 12 x 10 inches described in the listing.Owing both to their size and weight as well as their relatively high magnification they are not comfortable to use hand-held for any but the shortest period of time. For many the best binoculars are ones that can be strung over the neck and easily hand-held.  These are definitely not such a pair. Because of their magnification the slightest shake moves the astronomical object out of the field of view. Fortunately they come with a tripod adapter. However  for many the need to use a tripod runs counter to the desire to have a "portable" pair of hand-held binoculars.  For these observer's a smaller 50mm pair of binoculars is probably more appropriate.However even recognizing these binoculars cannot be hand-held for any extended period they are probably one of the best choices for astronomical observers who need relative portability compared to a probably more cumbersome and expensive telescope. Perhaps surprisingly they are also quite a useful adjunct even when using a telescope.In summary these binoculars allow for considerable additional exploration of astronomical objects compared to the naked eye. However a tripod or support for the arms is required for extended observations. Highly recommended.
5,I purchased the 15x70 Celestron Skymaster Binoculars primarily for casual astronomical viewing. Most of my remarks and observations center around using them for deep sky scans.First the basic stats:Magnification: 15 power (50% greater than 10x50's)Objective size: 70mm (equivalent light gathering power twice that of a 50mm binocular)Field of view is 4.4 degrees or 230 ft. at 1000 yardsA surprising near focus of a mere 43 ft.--exceptional for this type of binocular.Eye Relief: 18mm so one can wear eyeglasses--providing the rubber eyecups are folded downExit pupil is 4.67mm (only .33mm less than 10x50's at 5mm)Other stats: Center focused; BAK-4 prisms Porro design; Multi coated (but not fully multicoated) optics; Tripod adapter included an extra value (3 Â½ inch vertical clearance).  Case with strap--the latter the weakest part of the whole package.During daytime we used it for scanning distant wildlife and mountain ridges. Excellent performance. Tripod adapter best used when viewing level or slightly above level angles. I found it too tedious and straining to attempt oblique views with a conventional photographic tripod. A tip on holding it steadier by hand: rather than grasping it the normal way try holding each 70mm objective end with your hands.For amateur astronomers and novices wondering what you can see and its limitations here are some notes in viewing familiar objects: Jupiter is readily resolved as a disc but seems too bright to see its bands. Its four moons can be easily seen (when in view); Saturn was near the sun but I think one may be able to resolve or infer its ring shape; Compared with a traditional 7x50 or 10x50 binocular The Pleiades (M45) the Lagoon Nebula (M8) M35 in Gemini and the Orion Nebula (M42) are all breathtaking. So are the Scorpius open clusters M6 and M7. M13--the great Hercules Globular Cluster--was tantalizingly larger than the fuzzy spot I saw in my 10x50's. If you have a favorable southern horizon the globular cluster M22 in Sagittarius also exhibits size. You can resolve some of the Wild Duck Cluster M11. The shape of the Beehive open cluster (M44) in Cancer can be traced. Given a dark night the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) almost sprawls across the entire field of view with the companion galaxy M32 glimpsed as a fuzzy smudge. Even under urban and suburban skies M31 does show expansive width. Both the North American and Pelican Nebulae near the star Deneb at the top of Cygnus the Swan--the Northern Cross--can be detected on a dark night's viewing--with patience. The colorful double star Albireo (at the opposite end of Cygnus) can just be resolved if you can manage a steady view. Mizar & Alcor in the Big Dipper's handle are easy to separate. I found it difficult to keep the stars in the Pleiades from dancing across the view unless I used a flat surface to lean on or a tripod.In terms of field of view (4.4 degrees): You can see the entire belt of Orion in one field; you can capture the entire sword--including M42--in one field of view; The near parallelogram head of Delphinius the Dolphin fills a field; So do the Coat Hanger and Kemble Cascade asterisms respectively; In Lyra Vega and the stars epsilon and zeta fill a field. The latter two are revealed as double stars. So also is Castor in Gemini. The Perseus Double Cluster and nearby open cluster Stock 2 can fit in one field but in urban or moonlit settings this is more of a challenge. The three delightful open clusters sprawling across Auriga can be seen two at a time: Either M36 and M38 or M37 and M38 respectively. One of the four keystone stars in Hercules eta can be positioned with the globular cluster M13 also in the same scene. As the field of view is less than five degrees one cannot place the pointer stars in the Big Dipper in the same field nor contain the entire of the Hyades in Taurus. The central four stars in Cancer the Crab are just barely outside the field.I also own a pair of Celestron OptiView 10x50's and have found the increased magnification and light gathering power of the Skymaster 15x70 worth the price to upgrade. In a quick comparison the increase in apparent size of Jupiter's disc in the latter is quite noticeable as is that of M13 and M31. There is a pair of stars several degrees west of M13 that appears white in the 10x50's (at least to my eyes) yet are a stunning red with the 15x70 Skymaster. The moon of course can be seen with greater clarity in the Skymaster yet it does not fill the entire field of view. The down sides--and no surprise here--are that I can hold the former much steadier and see more of the sky with the smaller binos. There is also some chromatic aberration with the brighter objects like Jupiter but then again for the price point (about $60) that's part of the game.All in all I find the Skymaster 15x70 an excellent investment for the price. I've already relegated my trusty 10x50's to backup and use the Skymaster to quickly and effectively tour the heavens on nights when I don't want to take the time to set up my 8" SCT. I'd especially recommend it as a portable alternative for those considering purchasing the typical 60mm/2.4 inch department store telescope. The caveat is that one will have greater satisfaction with the use of a tripod or other means of steadying for sustained observing of stellar objects. I suggest acquiring a different tripod adapter such as the all metal Celestron Binocular Tripod Adaptor (#93512-A or equivalent) to alleviate some of the strain of viewing because it extends the height and clearance from the tripod an additional 1 1/8 inch vertical dimension beyond that of the supplied Bakelite tripod adapter.
5,i bought this pair of binoculars after having them for a long time in my shopping list after browsing around for the best binoculars for space viewing. i wish i could say more about why i picked these but i really don't remember. i was notified of a sale by amazon and i had the money so i picked them up on a whimi have to say they're perfect. on a tripod i can see very well. without a tripod it's quite shaky but not completely useless (definitely get the tripod though. the amazon basics tripod seems fine for me. i've literally never used a tripod before and i'm clumsy and not hands-on and i found it astoundingly intuitive.) in my inexperienced opinion despite what other reviews say the plastic adapter they come with is fine. it shakes a little as it settles in but once it's in it's good. i'd say if you don't want to spend even more money on an adapter at least try the plastic one out firstas far as what i got to see the moon looked stunning. my initial expectations were a little wild but what i wound up seeing was really cool. you can see all these little craters you can't see with the naked eye. i looked at it on a waxing gibbous night and i hear a half moon is the best but the craters looked great anyway. it looked a lot more detailed than i expected. also you can look at patches of the sky that look empty and see a rather lively assortment of stars through the binoculars. i also saw mars which looked like a slightly more mars-y looking dot than it usually does. as far as stuff on earth goes i spotted a couple planes which look a lot cooler in the binoculars than by naked eye. i saw them by holding the binoculars and once even by holding up the tripod in my hands and i'm small and weak for a man so like i said not entirely useless without being stationary on the tripod (admittedly though the image gets quite shaky and those more prone to headaches than i am may have a worse experience). lastly a hawk or eagle's nest a thousand or so feet from my backyard looks rather close in the binoculars and the view of the opposite side of a small pond in my backyard looks right up in my face but i would rather get lighter binoculars for backyard/nature viewingoverall i'm very pleased with my purchase especially after expecting to have many difficulties and instead finding the entire process extremely smooth and rewarding. if you're a newbie like me looking to get into viewing the sky i highly recommend these binoculars. i remember getting a cheap telescope when i was a kid and getting discouraged i didn't know how to use it and giving up. with better internet research i learned binoculars like these were the way to go and i wish i could go back in time to tiny me and give him these binoculars. so for anyone you know including yourself getting into astronomy grab them these binoculars and an amazon basics tripod and they'll be set!
4,Can see a mile with these but need to mount on a tripod to see far. Cannot hold in hands to view far because of hand shaking. You can hold in hand if only looking up close.
5,As expected good quality fast delivery.
5,I AM NOT A BINOCULAR EXPERT BUT I KNOW NIKON CAMERAS AND LENSES OVER 20 YEARS OF BEING A NATURE PHOTOGRAPHER USING LENSES THAT COST THEN OVER $1000. I KNOW WHAT IMAGES YOU CAN EXPECT FROM QUALITY EQUIPMENT.I recently moved next to a golf course filled with wildlife including geese doves ducks rabbits and coyotes  I had an ancient pair of Zenith fully coated 7X35 binoculars which were ok not especially sharp but with almost no flair or multiple images.  I wanted a higher power pair and over the next month bought four: a Celestron 16X32 roof top  prism bino the Barski 10-30X50 bino the Nikon Aculon 10-22X50 and the Skymaster 15X70.  I returned the first three as defective and kept the Skymaster 15X70.  Why?The worst bino by far was the Celestron 16X32 because not only was the collimation off but the optics were very fuzzy and there were lots of secondary images which made them totally useless.  Of course they were only $17.  Amazon did a fantastic job taking them back and refunding.Next was the Barska 10-30X50.  They were fairly good in terms of clarity and double images and collimation at 10 power but once over 20 power they were useless so unclear that they were useless like they had a medium fog in them.  They also had a lot of secondary images around the main image.I NOW ATTRIBUTE THE SECONDARY IMAGES TO THE UNCOATED LENSES BOUNCING LIGHT AROUND CREATING SECONDARY IMAGES THAT TAKE AWAY SHARPNESS BY KILLINGTHE ABILITY TO SEE SHARP EDGES. THE REFLECTED IMAGES WOULD NOT FOCUS DOWN TO THE CENTRAL IMAGE LOSING LAITY AND BRIGHTNESS.So I bought the Nikon 10-22X50 mm hoping for at least some of the clarity I find in my $400-$1400 Nikon camera lenses because those lenses have an "exit pupil" size large enough to cover a 35 MM film frame which in its corners means a circle requiring crystal clarity of over 43 mm which is far larger than the 3 mm needed at the 22 power of the Nikons therefore less expensive sized glass etc.But no.  The Nikon's had a higher degree of clarity than the other binos but the lenses are not fully multicoated and the multiple image problem was much worse than any other bino I tested. Also there was some blue color fringing on some bright sharp lines that totally obscured the clarity at that point.  The eye relief was only 8.6 mm which means you can't use eye glasses with them.  When I took them out at night I looked at a bright star and get this---I saw 21 images.  There were four light flares at 90 degree angles and embedded in each were 5 reflected images of that central bright star!! So I sent them back to Adorma which had to be threatened before they paid for shipping and they still may charge me $14.95 if they don't find them defective as I did.REMEMBER I DON'T HAVE THE MULTIPLE IMAGE PROBLEMS WITH THE ANCIENT ZENITH FULLY MULTICOATED ZENITH 7X35 BINOS.SO I ORDERED THE SKYMASTER NOT EXPECTING MUCH BUT WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED.These binos are bright.  They are not as clear as the Nikons but the reflected multiple image problem was the least of the four binos I bought and no noticeable color fringing and the magnification is good enough to read a clock on the patio of a house 150 yards away.  They revealed that amount of detail.  I am keeping them.But now I am aware that to get Nikon camera lens clarity in binos you need to spend a lot more than I did on the Nikons or Skymaster.  You need good quality multicoating phase adjusted and coated prisms perhaps ED glass and enough robustness to not lose collimation by being bumped in shipment.However for the price the Skymaster 15X70 is an excellent buy for terrestial use.  Because I am nearsighted without eyeglasses they focus at close as 35 feet or even less thus good for even small birds on nearby trees.I took it out last night for a go at the sky.  It beats all the others I tried hands down including the Nikons--flaring was much lower than the Nikons and no discernible multiple images on stars.
5,One needs a real stable tripod for good viewing. I saw 3 moons of Jupiter the first night!
4,I wanted to write a review for folks with little to no experience using binoculars or telescopes for stargazing because that is where I started.  I had to lookup what collimating was when I bought these and I'm still not sure I get how to adjust that on these binoculars; so I don't mess that just yet. These were purchased at the recommendation of a friend with much more stargazing experience than me though she left out lots of details.  Here is my experience:1) As other reviews state buy with a tripod and another adapter or they will be so shaky you won't see a thing.  I purchased the Celestron 93524 adapter and the Davis & Sanford EXPLORERV Vista Explorer 60" Tripod2) Even on the tripod they are very sensitive to movement so the slightest touch and vibration and they get shaky.  In fact I never have them stable for more than a few seconds but I can still see some great things.  This was the only major disappointment I had with the binoculars.  Images are pretty shaky no matter how still you get; even on the tripod.....so I would consider them virtually useless without a tripod.3)  I can see the moons around Jupiter which was so incredibly beautiful that it made the purchase worth it for that view alone.  The moons appear as very bright specs around the planet and are very radiant.  Saturn has also been visible in the night sky and I can make out a planet with a thick strip in the middle so I know it's Saturn but don't expect a lot of details.  Remember these are only 15X.  The moon (Earth's moon) is very detailed with these binoculars and incredible to look at when full.4) The ISS has been visible with the naked eye but I never try to view it with these binoculars because it moves too fast and these are not good binoculars for viewing objects like that.5) I gave a rating of 4 stars because they are great for the novice who is just getting started. Once you determine that this is something you want to keep doing it would be best to upgrade to something with image stabilizing. Those will be much more expensive of course.For someone with more experience these would probably get a 2 or 3 star review and as I get more experienced I like these less and less.  This review is being written after me using very casually (less than 10 times a year at first but now I'm using a few times a month) for 3-4 years.  When I just started though they were perfect.  A great entry level price point and I could get my "feet wet" in the stargazing world before spending more money on a new and casual hobby.  For the novice this is an overall good purchase with the tripod and adapter I mentioned earlier.  If I had to buy them again as my first stargazing binoculars I absolutely would; it was a great choice.
5,I normally don't take the time to write a review for something I purchased but after reading a hundred plus reviews from multiple websites on the Celestron Skymaster 15x70 Binoculars I decided to write one in hopes of helping someone else in making their decision to puchase these binoculars or not. I must first say I am no expert by any means in Astronomy or binoculars. That being said these binoculars are great for someone just getting into astronomy like myself. I have a pair of 7x35 binoculars I used from time to time to look at the moon and scan the sky which definitely help aid the naked eye but they are simply no comparison to the 15x70s. The negative reviews concerning the collimation issues along with complaints of this pair being too heavy for handheld use were nearly enough to deter me from purchasing them. After I put in more time researching than I probably should have I decided to go ahead and buy them. I decided to wait on buying a tripod and try them out handheld first to see just how difficult it was. I drove about 15 minutes to a nearby greenway the first night I had them and was anxious to test them out. The moon was full and I definitely had the best view I'd ever had in person through the 15x70s. Like I said before the 7x35s don't compare. The moon looked 15 times closer in HD and I could see tons of craters. I scanned up a ways a found Jupiter. I could easily see Jupiter and the four Galilean moons. Needless to say it took me a total of 5 minutes to realize I got my moneys worth. The weight of the binoculars aren't too overwhelming. I did realize however that If I were going to spend a lot of time looking at the sky a tripod would really come in handy. Even if the binoculars aren't too heavy it's still difficult to fixate on one planet cluster or nebula for too long without seeing "dancing stars". I'm sure there are breathing techniques you can use to help keep it steady but I figured I would give a tripod a try. I decided to buy locally to avoid having to wait a few more days for it to be shipped. I bought a Targus 58' Camera & Camcorder tripod for $28. It was really easy to set up and has a lot of adjustments along with a 360 degree swivel. The adapter that came with the Binoculars isn't expensively built by any means but it works fine for now. Very easy to attach/use. Last night I used the tripod and it really did make a world of difference. Once you set your sights to an object the tripod does it's job of stabilizing the image for you. I will continue to use the binoculars hand held but I'll get a lot of use out of the tripod too because it adds another "element" to stargazing. In only two nights out so far I've seen the moon like I've never seen it before Jupiter and it's four moons M42 (Orion Nebula) M43 M44 (Beehive Cluster) and many other clusters. You may see a cluster of 3 stars with the naked eye but when you bring up the binoculars to where you were looking so much more will visible. It's faily easy to find what you are looking for with these as the provide a wide field of view through the large lenses. In conclusion of my review the Celestron Skymaster 15x70 Binoculars are a great bang for your buck especially for a beginner to astronomy such as myself. The tripod isn't necessary but a great added tool to help aid you in keeping what you want to see steady. I also forgot to mention I took them out of the box and adjusted them to my eyes during the daylight. I had no collimation issues at all. My pair came perfectly intact and ready to use. I hope you find this review helpful in aiding you to make a decision on whether or not to buy these.
4,sadly the tripod adapter and rainguard were not in the box
4,Muy buenos binoculares es verdad que requieren trÃ­pode debido al peso. Las imÃ¡genes son muy nÃ­tidas gracias a su prisma BK4. Los buenos trÃ­podes son muy costosos asÃ­ que le comprÃ© un trÃ­pode fuerte para parlantes y le fabriquÃ© el soporte que rota 360Â°  y sube y baja lo necesario para observaciÃ³n astronÃ³mica
5,I brought them to a picnic on a lake and 2 people ordered them at the party. Theyâre a little hard to keep an object steady but I really love them for the price. Iâll try them on a tripod soon
5,So far itâs been a great purchase. Great quality ease of use.
4,There are glowing reviews and terrible reviews both i think are unfounded  so I thought I'd try and give a balanced review.This is a great product overall. You will see spectacular views of the moon and larger deep sky objects like the Andromeda galaxy and the Orion nebula. These are  a better entry to the world of astronomy than a telescope due to their portability and ease of use.First these binoculars are meant for astronomy.These are heavy and due to the 15x magnification need to be mounted on a monopod or tripod. I can't overemphasize that.The focus is slow and stiff.If sports hunting or birding is your primary use look elsewhere at smaller lighter binoculars.If astronomy is you primary use you may be able to live with these for occasional terrestrial viewing.These binoculars are not a telescope. Sounds kind of simplisticI know  but if you are seeking to see the bands on Jupiter or detail in Satrun's rings  these won't do that for you. But you will be able to see Jupiter's moons and the rings on Saturn - enough that you can tell what you're looking at.The "very good":Optically these binoculars are very good. The field is bright and flat and they focus sharp to the edges. False color (Chromatic aberration) is visible as red/blue fringing around bright objects. It is not at all severe but it is there and visible on bright celestial and high contrast terrestrial objects. It is worse at the edges of the field than in the center. Views of large deep sky objects like the Orion nebula  are really beautiful. The contrast is very good.The "just ok"Mechanically the focus is a little hard to adjust. There is some play in the mechanism that has to be accounted for but it is very easy to focus out then back in to the point of perfect focus. Once focused they stay that way for a long time.The "totally unacceptable"The plastic tripod adapter is totally and completely useless.  The binoculars just rotate back and forth and it takes forever for them to settle down after you move them. That's a shame because at 15x magnification  these need to be mounted on a sturdy tripod.  Even in light wind the tripod adapter just causes the binoculars to wiggle back and forth.I have ordered the Celestron 93524 Binocular Tripod Adapter and will see if it is good enough. Even with that adapter the center of graviry of the binoculars won't be at the tripod's pivot point  so you have to keep the friction on and that makes it harder to move them. A better balanced tripod mounting scheme would be killer.Summary:An incredible value. Good optics decent mechanics and an unusable tripod adapter.Celestron: Throw a decent tripod adapter that is sturdy and fit for the purpose. Extra credit for centering  the CG at the the tripod attachment point. Lose the useless strap and raise the price
5,Really liked this binocular.  Very easy to use it.
4,I purchased these as a first foray into stargazing.  I really wanted a small telescope but most of the review sites suggested a pair of 10x50 binoculars to start with.  I'm no fool bigger is always better so I ordered these 15x70 giants instead.Lesson one: You will never ever hold these steady enough to enjoy the view they give of the stars.  Try holding them near the front lenses instead of the normal grips. They're fairly heavy and the 15x means the view is very wiggly.  10x50s would be much lighter and with less magnification easier to hold steady.Lesson two: You're not going to use these without a tripod.  Get a good name brand tripod to go with these the $20 model won't be steady enough.  Go ahead and order an aluminum binocular mount as well. The plastic one included with these isn't strong enough to support them and will wobble around for 5+ seconds every time you bump it.Lesson three: Once you get a nice mount and attach it to a good tripod these binoculars are amazing!  The Orion nebula jumps out at you! Jupiter is extremely bright and you can count the Galilean moons.  Saturn is a little oblong thing.  The moon....WOW the moon is amazing.  I've never seen a magnified view of a star cluster until I bought these.  It doesn't sound that impressive (wow a bunch of stars on a black background?) but you're scanning across the sky and suddenly BOOM your vision is FULL of thousands of stars.  Amazing!  If only I could see these things a little closer!  This leads to...Lesson four: Why didn't I buy a small telescope?  I get the limitations of a small scope.  Optical quality mount quality difficulty of use for a beginner all of the other things people fault them for.  I just don't see how these are much better for stargazing.  Jupiter is very bright.  Wouldn't it be nice to trade some of that brightness for 30x magnification and see some detail?  At least with a small telescope you'd have the option.  Same for the moon and saturn.I should have listened to the sages of the internet and bought some 10x50 binoculars to learn with.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy the Celestron brand again.  The coatings on these are great the build quality is good and there's plenty of eye relief for a glasses wearer.  There were a few little glue spots visible but no big deal.  I recently compared them directly to a Nikon pair of the same size.  The build quality on the Nikons was a little better but optically there wasn't much to choose between the two.These are actually fantastic for watching deer elk and birds out in the woods.  Even as it gets dark (when the elk come out) the 70mm light gathering ability of these lets us see much later than our friends with 30-50mm binoculars.  The tripod adapter is actually perfect in that setting.  The wobble doesn't seem as bad when viewing wildlife as opposed to tiny specs of light.These probably aren't the best choice for a beginning astronomy enthusiast.  You'd be better off with 10x50s or the 70mm Celestron Travel Scope which sells for about the same price and lets you add eyepieces for more magnification.  For stargazing these are probably best for experienced astronomers looking for a particular piece of equipment.On the other hand if you want fantastic views of wildlife and the occasional glance at the moon these are perfect. I'm saving for a telescope but I will probably buy a Celestron based on my experience with the build and optical quality of these binoculars.
4,Great for the price. Nothing fancy does what I need it to do
5,I've been an amateur astronomer for about 23 years. I have a broad amount of experience with the kind of optics that are used for astronomy. I have used most every type of instrument and have visited some of the great professional telescopes. I have hand built my own newtonian telescope including machining the german equatorial mount. Soon after completing this instrument I took it to a star party and ended up on my back with a pair of Fujinon SX binoculars. To make a long story short I preferred the binos to the view in my telescope. Telescopes are expensive they are big heavy hard to move hard to store complicated to set up correctly and the view through the eyepiece can be crowded and dissapointing. For the casual observer binoculars are the superior choice. They are everything that a telescope is not...relatively cheap light easy use. And because they are so easy to use you will end up using them much more often than you would a cumbersome telescope. That aspect of binoculars alone will make them show you much more than a telescope ever would. The Celestron 15X70 Skymasters are by far and away the best amateur astronomy instrument for the money on the market right now. They are truly and incredible value. You could spend $600+ on Fujinon SX binoculars and have a very fine instrument but after using these that would be a hard argument to make. Most everyone's eyes are not able to discern the fine differences between the two instuments. Mind you I am not telling you that these are as good as the Fujinons but at about a 10th of the price...well you get the idea. My experience with Celestron is that they are a first class operation. And now with their lifetime no-fault warranty the best in the industry you can purchase products from them knowing that if anything ever goes wrong for whatever reason they will always stand behind their product. If you are looking to get started in astronomy or looking for an excuse to leave your telescope in the closet these binoculars are a great value and with proper care will last a lifetime and show you more wonders than you will ever see frustrating yourself with a high magnification-small field telescope. Get them take them outside at night with your kids and wonder why.......
4,It took 3 tries to get a complete package that was not out of collimation.  I suspsect that the great price may be a result of being refurbished or returned products which was not stated.  As always Amazon is hassle free about returning/replacing the items...just hate the wasted time.The first pair came in and the box looked like it definitely had been opened (the product box not the shipping box).  When I opened it I found that the binoculars were badly out of collimation.  Upon further inspection the left tube was loose and came unscrewed very easily.  The right tube had no issue.  Part of the binoculars had a fairly decent scratch/dent as if it had fallen or something.  The neck strap was missing and the lens cleaning cloth was missing (didn't realize this until the 2nd pair came in to replace the first).The second pair came in and noticed right away that things were packaged in the box differently than the first one.  The first pair came with the carrying bag and binoculars packaged separately inside the box.  This 2nd pair came with the binoculars stored inside the bag inside the box.  Both lens covers were missing which I might not have known if I hadn't received one pair already that had them.The third pair came in fine and are wonderful so far but I can't help but wonder if they weren't returned by a customer and repackaged/shipped out to me with each package missing different items and being damaged in such a way that I doubt it could be from shipping.I primarily bought these along with a pair of 7x50 binoculars as a first step in satisfying my sons new found interest in astronomy.  I tested them in the daytime and they provided a fantastic magnified view 250 yards away (the max I tried in my initial testing).  I took them out at night to test on the stars and was just as impressed.  Clearly focused in on Jupiter and saw many other stars in the sky.As has been mentioned by others they become heavy quick and are not for long use.  Due to their size and weight you will definitely want a tripod for these.  They will work well if you are lying on your back looking at the stars and holding the binos at the end of the lens tube.The cleaning cloth that came with it was useless.  It left all kinds of lint on the lenses.  I used a cloth from my camera and it cleaned it up so much better.The tripod adapter is and el cheapo and about useless.  I ended up buying an aluminum one that is much better.The neck strap does it's job but is not comfortable.  I don't use a neck strap much but if you do I would recommend getting a better one.For the price I would definitely recommend these for the binoculars alone...but be prepared to inspect them for defects and make sure you get everything that should have come with them.My package came with (which I think is complete now)1) The binoculars2) Instructions3) 2 individual lens covers4) 1 long eyepiece cover (covers both)5) 1 Carrying case with strap6) 1 neckstrap for the binoculars7) 1 cloth for cleaning the lenses8) 1 tripod adapter
4,We bought these binoculars for our son when he turned seven.  He has a great interest in astronomy and we considered buying him a telescope.  We had read several reviews recommending buying a student a nice pair of binoculars before purchasing a telescope.  This recommendation proved to be exactly right.  Our entire family has enjoyed these binoculars and the lunar eclipse over Michigan a few weeks ago was a delight!  They are heavy but our seven year old is able to handle them and they come with a neck strap.  He knows their value and has been quite careful with them.  I wouldn't hesitate to give them to another child this age.The reason I can't give the binoculars five stars is as follows:  This last weekend one of the eye-pieces broke off.  Knowing that there is a no-fault warranty on the binoculars I called Celestron.  The customer service man was knowledgeable and cordial but it was only then that I became aware of the warranty catch.  To take advantage of the no-fault warranty service you must send back the broken binoculars and pay $25 for service handling and shipping of the new binoculars.  I somehow missed this little detail when we received the binoculars and read through the warranty information included in the box.  When I stated that now the $80 binoculars that I bought in September are going to cost me $105 he said "Well that's two sets of great binoculars that you got for $105."  That's just a ridiculous point for him to make because I have to send the broken ones back and they are unusable anyway. He obviously didn't major in debate in college OR that's what he's told to say when a customer challenges that policy.Needless to say I feel it is important for Amazon customers to know this before purchasing.  I am going to send back the binoculars pay the $25 and see how Celestron does with standing behind their warranty claims.  I will update this review when I get the new binoculars.I would still purchase them but I would have liked to be aware of the warranty catch ahead of time.  Happy stargazing!UPDATE:  I sent the binoculars back to Celestron and received a brand new pair four weeks later.  They didn't give me any hassle and everyone I spoke to on the phone was very helpful.  We are enjoying the new pair very much.  The only downside is that along with the $25 I had to pay Celestron for warranty service handling and shipping of the new ones it cost me almost $15 to ship the original broken binoculars back to them.  So now I have spent $80 on the first binoculars and $40 to get a new pair. I also advise anyone with a warranty issue to spend the few extra dollars for delivery confirmation if you have to return a product.  When I called two weeks after sending back the binoculars the man I talked to had no record that they had ever arrived but the post office was easily able to confirm that they had been delivered to Celestron.  Also in reading through the included booklet again I realized why I had missed the warranty catch in the first place:  It's not there.  The customer is referred to the Celestron website for further warranty information.  It seems like that information should be pretty prominent.  While they definitely didn't hassle me on the warranty issue the extra $40 to get a new pair is enough to make me think twice about purchasing from Celestron again.
5,I bought these binoculars specifically to watch the progress toward the conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter on 2020-12-21 but 2020-12-13 was the last clear sky.  I attached a picture to show you what quality I got.  I was looking for a low price point for astronomical binoculars and I am satisfied."Frequently bought together" lists Celestron 81035 Smartphone Adaptor...please read its reviews before buying.  For my Samsung S8+ 73mm wide with front camera at horizontal center I bought the Gorsky spotting scope smarphone camera adaptor to fit the Celestron - SkyMaster Giant 15x70 Binoculars.  I had some doubts when I read the dimensions in the ad it said "...eyepiece outer diameter btwn 25mm-45mm."  I used a digital caliper and it was borderline on 45mm.  That was the first day I had the binoculars in my hands. I asked a product question "Do the eyepieces fold down when you attach a camera?" and the answers I received were "Yes."  I tried to fold them down like opening a clam shell.  But there was no hinge point.  I finally discovered that the eyepieces fold down like the top of a sock.  The Gorsky goes on snugly but there is a bit of leeway.  Turn the outer ring to tighten the 3 jaws."Frequently bought together lists" BARSKA binocular tripod adaptor.  Yes buy it with the SkyMaster Giant 15x70 Binoculars.  The plastic adaptor that comes with the binoculars will function but it wobbles so much you will want a metal adaptor.  I bought a FIZZ it is fine.The carry bag needs a flap pocket.  What am I supposed to do with the 3 lens covers the lens cleaning cloth and the strap?  (Hmm...I keep the binoculars on the tripod and the lens covers in the bag.  That works.)  The KobraTech 70 Inch Tripod is plenty heavy duty and comes with a bluetooth shutter clicker with 2 buttons for iOS and Android.
5,Can see everything
4,The value rating is 5 stars hands down.I am the type (used to be anyhow) who always wanted the best and most expensive of whatever it was I wanted. I figured this way I would have all the latest and greatest features and capabilities whether I knew what the heck I was doing or not. I seriously considered laying out some serious cash for a very expensive high-end set of binoculars (and still might) but after reading several reviews about this set I decided to buy them to see what I was in for.For the price it's  a steal (again for value..5 stars). I am not sure how much better a pair of bino's that are 5x more expensive will be and what will I get for that extra money? The beauty of these is that although they are not dirt cheap they are not so expensive that I have to be overly protective of them as to where and when I use them.I have a 10" Dobson and some of the views can be breath taking e.g. Jupiter and its moons. The difference is I use the bino's constantly and the Dobson once a month maybe...and maybe not.I will take them everywhere I go if I think I will have a chance to use them. I have had a pair of 10 x 50 for years now and used them pretty extensively but these Skymaster 15x certainly have more power that is immediately noticeable and the clarity of the lenses have come a long way.Unless you are very very steady you will need a tripod or these wonderfil binos may end up being a burden. You may be able to hold steady for awhile but to really enjoy them for any amount of time go ahead and get a tripod if you don't have one. Luckily I had an old camera tripod that worked fine although a sturdier tripod would be even nicer. I had to buy some 1/4" bolts from Walmart to mount them but no problem.I have not found anything else even close at this price. Makes me think they are about to be discontinued and replaced with a new version but so what if they are. Great deal and very nice set of binoculars. Very pleased.**UPDATE** May 24 2010The price is even lower now! I also have a more powerful and more expensive spotting scope and though it provides greater magnification the large bright and clear view of these bino's still makes them superior for some applications. Even more of a no-brainer at this price. Use the savings to buy a tripod.**UPDATE** July 24 2010The price has jumped considerably. I paid around $70 for them. Still well worth the price compared to the competition. All the above still applies.**UPDATE** November 26 2010$49.99 - are you kidding me?! This is one of the best deals on Amazon! This is an excellent set of binos. Not as powerful as my spotting scope but a much sharper view.
3,For a 100 bucks they are OK. Optics are OK. Not great crisp and clean like Leupold or Nikon but Ok for what they cost. Collimation is not great you may have to try and adjust. Focus is adequate and seems to hold position. The adapter to hold these to the tripod is not adequate to keep vibration at a minimum which is a big deal since I really don't think you can use these without a good tripod. If you wear eyeglasses like I do you will really struggle with eye relief. I use mine on a tripod without glasses and work really hard not to touch since vibration really ruins your ability to use these.  Finally if your IPD is greater than 70 these may not work for you. I end up just using one tube a lot because just can't get them wide enough.
4,Celestron Skymaster 15x70I've had bad experiences with inexpensive binoculars in the past but these seemed like a great deal with plenty of positive reviews on Amazon. After taking about 30 minutes to sit down and play with the binocular and make all the adjustments (diopter and focus as well as the IPD) I have to say these are very good. The optical clarity is exceptional. In my opinion it is close to the Steiner binoculars we used in the military - but the Steiner had different coatings on the lenses that made a purplish/bluish hue for the images and had obviously better exterior construction.The Celestron Skymaster doesn't feel cheap but it isn't exactly a high-end pair of binoculars. The center focusing mechanism constantly shifts especially when you lift the binoculars by the eyepiece assembly. You can see it spinning by itself! The lens caps aren't tethered and feel cheap. But they have a decent heft yet don't feel too heavy to absolutely require a tripod.I bought the Skymaster mainly for outdoor use. After adjusting the focus ring I was able to focus clearly on objects as close as 10 yards and as far out as 200 meters. Identifying small and fine features at 200m would require stabilization like a tripod. But I've used cheap optics in the past that had a difficult time focusing clearly at 100 yards with excessive chromatic aberration and shimmering. The Skymaster doesn't seem to exhibit this behavior although there is slight chromatic aberration at the outer edges of the image. The large 70mm objective lenses allow for the binoculars to work even in low light conditions.I did not have any problems with collimation like many others reported. However I noticed I'd see double until I relaxed my eyes and allowed it to collimate automatically. I wonder if these users that report collimation issues suffer from astigmatism or need their vision corrected. I hear tons of complaints about EOTech Aimpoint and Trijicon ACOG optics looking like a cluster of grapes and they assumed it was a defective optic but this usually occurs when your vision isn't corrected to 20/20.Overall: 4/5 stars overall it exceeded my expectations. It is inexpensive but works extremely well. Optical quality is great but the exterior construction could be better. There are no tethered lens caps and the focus adjustment has a mind of its own  if you touch the eyepiece assembly. But overall it is actually a good pair of binoculars at this price point.
5,Very nice binoculars. The tripod mount very flimsy touching the binoculars cause them to wobble side to side to several seconds when mounted on a very solid tripod. Made my own mount from solid aluminum that fixed the problem.
1,I love looking at the night sky and have always wanted a closer look at the moon stars etc. Unfortunately I had never but trouble with the various "quality" beginner telescopes I tried and ultimately returned. So I have gone without or used an old pair of sports binoculars I had. Then I saw some deals on Woot! which caught my eye in regard to telescopes and astronomical binoculars which got me interested in pursuing this avenue as a solution. I checked out reviews both on Amazon and other Internet resources and decided to purchase the Celestron SkyMaster Giant 15x70 astronomical binoculars.Before making the actual purchase I checked out the Amazon Warehouse deals for this item (who doesn't like to save money right?). They had several in stock in various grades of condition. I selected a "like new" condition and paid a few dollars more for this. As you know the Warehouse sells returned or damaged items. This pair was listed as having been inspected was in like new condition etc. This is important as it will play a big part in what happens later.The binoculars arrived quickly and I removed them from the Amazon shipping box. The Celestron box looked brand new but it had been opened. The binoculars were packed inside along with the tripod adapter a cleaning cloth and manual. Everything looked great! I couldn't wait to go outside and see what I could see. And what I could see was a pronounced double image. Crud. My luck with telescopes has jumped over to something as simple as binoculars. I would have no luck at all if it wasn't bad. Back to the box they went as I tried to decide if I wanted to return them (which is no doubt why they were at the Amazon Warehouse having been returned for this reason by someone else). I had read more than a few of the one-star ratings given by other reviewers citing this as a problem with these binoculars. It is called collimation and happens when the optics are not aligned correctly. Great this is the problem I was now experiencing.I think that the late comic and actor Marty Feldman would have been the only person to have been able to use these binoculars in their current state. I went online to see if I could find a way to easily fix the problem (otherwise they were going back to Amazon). Luckily good luck this time for me I found many web sites and videos that show how to correct the problem. The bad news is that most of these required me to fiddle with various set-screws and try and adjust the internal prisms into correct alignment. I really didn't want to do this and risk breaking something. Then I found a forum where someone having this problem (with a different brand of binoculars btw) only had to unscrew the main barrels and re-screw them back into place. Apparently QC at the assembly factory isn't always the greatest and this can cause the problem and have nothing to do with the prisms. I started looking at where the barrels attached to the mid/focusing section (sorry I don't know the correct terminology) and noticed the rubber material coating the barrels was bunched-up in places where it was assembled. Could this be the problem?So I set about unscrewing the barrels from the mid-section. Both easily unscrewed from that assembly and I saw that a little chrome ring (I don't know if it acts as a washer or is from cosmetic purposes) was not seated well and had cross-threaded some of the screw threads. I reseated it and then reattached the barrels. the rubber coating was no longer binding as it did. So now for testing. I just went outside and looked at the moons. Wait! The _moon_ as the double vision was GONE! The fix to my collimation problem was that simple. Yes!I lack the experience and/or expertise to go into a really in-depth description of the binoculars and their use for celestial viewing. What I can say is that I could see the moon and stars clearly and they were bright. Looking at the foothills was also a treat. I set-up my camera tripod to use the tripod adapter that came with the binoculars. They attach easily to the tripod but I don't care for their quality (they are plastic). I also don't care for the plastic cap that Celestron uses to cover the adapter mounting hole in the binoculars as it is also cheap plastic. But aside from those two items I am now happy with my purchase and look forward to spending more time outside with them.This experience makes me wonder how many of these are in the Warehouse with this problem? I cannot say my fix will work in all cases of collimation errors with these binoculars but it is certainly a quick and easy fix for a nice set of modestly priced astronomical binoculars.UPDATE July 2021: For the past year these binoculars continued to have collimation issues. They would almost work as I wrote in the initial review then would fail and be out of collimation again. I finally had enough of using the aforementioned way I initially "fixed" the problem and went for a fix the hard way. I researched online pulled the grips off the binos and set about manually adjusting the prisms using the screws for that purpose in the binoculars. I worked on them for a couple of hours before one of the screws seized and would no longer move / adjust. It was game over at this point and into the trash bin they went.I think someone commented long after it was posted on my initial review. They said they shouldn't have to perform such adjustments / repairs on a new set (I'm paraphrasing). I wholeheartedly agree. Binoculars with this problem from this manufacturer continue to appear for sale with this problem. I do think that QC is a big problem and do not recommend these binoculars for purchase.
5,I got these binoculars because I was going on a cruise and I wanted a decent pair of binoculars to look at the night sky from the sea.  They also came in pretty handy for seeing other ships across the sea.  They worked great and were the envy of all the other people on my ship.  At home it is fairly light polluted so I wasn't expecting to see much but I was amazed at how many stars that I could now make out with these bad boys that I could not see with the naked eye not even faintly.  But they started to really shine when I pointed them at Jupiter.  The first time I did this I was absolutely amazed when I was able to see the four Galilean moons. These aren't quite powerful enough to make out the colors of Jupiter but you can definitely see it and I now feel obligated to check out Jupiter each night to see where the moons are.As many have said with having what basically amounts to two small telescopes in your hands these are extremely hard to hold steady.  At first I tried to use a tripod and that worked OK but was awkward and inconvenient. Then one week ago someone had suggested getting a monopod.  Man oh man that truly made a difference and I recommend to anybody that owns these to invest the money in a monopod.  The monopod is much easier to use with these and allows you to hold the binoculars steady as with a tripod but with the added bonus of them being much more convenient and versatile.  Now I just leave the binoculars connected to the monopod and carry them together.  With this combination I have the choice to sit stand or get on my knees to check out the views.You can't really beat these for the price.  Speaking of beating these the one thing that you don't want to do with these guys is drop them on the ground.  Sadly my friend was over last night and accidentally dropped them this caused one of the mirrors to get out of alignment and now they just aren't working correctly anymore.  He is ordering me a replacement pair and I loved these so much that I told him to go ahead and upgrade these to the 20x80 version for just a little bit more.  Can't wait to check those out....****Edit*****When I wrote this review I wasn't aware of the Celestron's No Fault Warranty. Basically it is a no questions asked lifetime guarantee where they will repair or replace your binoculars for a $25 processing fee.  I sent my broken pair in about 3 weeks ago and lo and behold they sent me a brand new pair today.  This is an excellent policy!  I have been using the 20x80 version now for about a month and these are so light in comparison.
3,I like these binoculars great field of view. But do not use them in the fog or rainy days. They will get moisture inside them and it takes days for it to go away.
5,After reading a number of reviews of telescopes and various articles on backyard astronomy I took the consistent advice of the various sources and bought binoculars.  From the reviews (external reviews as well) and the price the Celestron 15 x 70s seemed to be a good choice.As soon as I opened the box (well packed from the shipper) I was a bit surprised by the size and weight.  Believe the other reviewers you probably won't want to hold these for an extended period.  A tripod is inexpensive and highly recommended.  I'm using a Targus model TG-6600TR (extends to 66" tall) allowing me to look at many objects while standing up.  Also because of the magnification it is hard to hold the binoculars steady enough for decent stargazing.The binoculars feel solid and well-built.  The coating on the outside makes them easy to hold and the focuser is easy to adjust and doesn't have excess play.  The diopter is a bit more of a challenge but the whole operation is simple enough (I think it just takes a bit of practice and patience).  For me the ability to adjust for wearing glasses is a big plus.  On that topic the long eye relief is also great for anyone wearing glasses.Ok on to the good stuff...what can you see with these?  Once I had them attached to the tripod adjusted and focused I turned them up to the sky.  I'm gazing from my backyard in the city so light pollution is an issue.  The easiest target that night was Jupiter.  With the naked eye Jupiter was a big bright point.  Through the binoculars Jupiter took shape as a orange-yellow sphere (please do NOT think you will see detail like those Hubble telescope images).  What I found amazing was seeing Jupiter's four largest moons even as points of light.  After a few minutes staring I turned the binoculars at the constellation Orion and the famous nebula.  What appears as a faint fuzzy patch to the naked eye is a hazy but brilliant sight.  If I looked slightly away from the nebula I could make out some shape to the gaseous clouds.  The Pleiades Mars and even the Andromeda galaxy are all easy enough targets and even from an area with modest light pollution.I haven't been able to test these out on Saturn yet but it should be higher in the sky in the March / April evenings.  I'm looking forward to getting away from the city lights on a clear night to really give these binoculars a test.At this price (especially with free shipping) the Celestron 15 x 70s are an excellent deal and are an inexpensive way to begin stargazing.  While you may not see all those awe-inspiring images from the Hubble telescope you will be looking at a live show that will never cease to satisfy.
4,I bought the Skymaster 15x70 specifically for stargazing and replace my ancient Bushnell 7x35. I bought this unit for $49 Dec 2011. It was on sale.The good and the bad:I'll start with the bad:This unit had a bad alignment problem -giving double images. I know I could have sent it back for a replacement but I wanted to used it right away and I didn't want to wait again and take another chance. Also I already anticipated that this would happen and so I read on the 'net on how to correct the problem. The misalignment was vertical(1 up the other down). I used a small screw driver and made clockwise 1/4 turn then observed and then an 1/8 turn on the screw underneath the rubber armor over the left prism body -it's near the edge just pullback the rubber. The rubber just snaps right back over it when you're done. Anyway after that 1/8 turn it was fixed! I cannot detect 2 images anymore.The eyepiece rubber also had a smell -but it goes away after a while. There appears to be only one coating on the front objective lens and the eyepiece. It is not multi-coated.Now the good:The images are bright and sharp. It was apparent right away that the optics are superior to the Bushnell 7x35. Stars were sharper. Mounted on a tripod and observing from a light-polutted area I'm surprised how many faint stars are visible. Jupiter's moons are very easily seen. Jupiter itself is a disk -no bands. The Pleades cluster revealed a lot of stars. I could see stars that I could previously see only through my C8 telescope. On the Orion nebula I could see it's basic shape. Orion's belt fits in the field of view -and again a lot of stars that I previously saw only through my telescope. I was able to see stars as faint as 9.5 magnitude under my severely light-polluted skies(limited to mag 4 unaided). The Moon was mesmerizing. Like a floating ball in space. I could see a lot of craters. There's very little false color on the bright moon which is good. At some point I will take this binoculars to a better observing site and append this review. But for now here's the summary:If it were not for the alignment issue I would have given this Skymaster 5 stars. This is an incredible bargain. $49 doesn't even buy a full tank of gas these days. For a binocular this big and powerful it's practically a give away. Just note that at 15x magnification and the extra weight you need a tripod to get the most out of it. But it can be used hand held for short periods. If you're prepared to deal with an alignment issue it's a great bargain.
4,I purchased these and they arrived on time. I have used "Standard Size" binoculars for hunting and general use for over 50 years and these are my First pair of "Giant Binoculars". Other than the enormous size and increase in weight these are Binoculars. After taking these out of the box I was quite pleased with the overall quality and "feel" of the binoculars. Very nice rubber coating and overall they seemed heavy and well built. I also ordered the Vista Explorer 60" light weight tripod with the binoculars. OK...so here is what I got: 1) On the first "trial" I could not get the binoculars to focus and the images were Double and Misaligned. This was a disappointment but like many things in life can be disappointing and many other reviews Cautioned about defects I took my chances based on the low price and free returns with "Prime". Like any other purchases I make that are seemingly defective I am most likely to try and determine and correct the problem before returning especially if a lot of reviews "Exclaim" about the quality. (if it had a Flat tire would you simply try putting air in it BEFORE returning ? I would ! ) So I got online and immediately found this site:  http://www.oberwerk.com/support/collimate.htm  It turns out that this particular problem is a "colimmation" issue and not "that" serious and if You have any mechanical ability and some basic experience with Jewelers screwdrivers this is an Easy Fix. It did take me about 45 minutes but for $60 I think these Binoculars are still a Great Value ! 2) These Binoculars are Heavy. You will need a tripod if you plan on using them for more than 15 minutes or something to lean or rest them on. I purchased the Vista Explorer 60" "LIGHTWEIGHT" Tripod. It clearly says these are light weight and ANY time you put something Very Heavy on top of something Light Weight You Will have issues. Key words here: "Heavy" and "Light weight". 3) I bought these binoculars and tripod to introduce my 10 year old Grandson to Beginning Astronomy. I didn't want to spend a small fortune on a telescope and figured this will suffice in fulfilling the requirements of his first time and at a minimum provide some exposure. He will learn to be patient. He will learn to be very patient very gentle and very careful with this New "high dollar equipment". In conclusion if you have very little mechanical ability and things have to be perfect and you have very little patience then do not buy these Binoculars OR this particular tripod. Go ahead and spend $1000 to get some serious equipment. I consider the 45 minutes it took me to  remedy the adjustment issue (collimate) kind of like "assembly required". Also I now know how to collimate binoculars.
4,Couldn't decide between 4 or 5 stars but really feel 4 is most deserving for the product and 5 for the price.  Quality optics on these binocs and no collimation issues at all.  Use them mainly for star gazing when I don't want to haul out the big scope and they resolve stars to fine points of light when they are off the edges.  The angular field of view is 4.4 degrees which is outstanding for these and the exit pupil of 4.7mm is great for those of us who wear glasses.  However objects are blurred on the edges and really don't come into a sharp focus unless they are within about a 3.2 degree angular field which is mainly where you're looking anyway. That's to be expected with what you pay for these and it's certainly not a show stopper at all just an observation.  The other issue is the coatings could be better. With Celestron putting their name on these I would have expected a tad better but then the price wouldn't be $49 either.If you plan on looking at the moon you need to do it when it's a crescent.  Anything beyond that and optics appear to be fogged because of the amount of light the moon will spill into the optics and it's excessive even at a half moon.  However these optics have great resolution and show a tremendous amount of lunar detail!  Jupiter and it's moons are awesome as are the Pleiades and Andromeda shows as a nice elongated fuzz ball.  Use averted vision when looking at Andromeda seems to view better.  Orion's nebula also shows well but you're not going to see the detail you would in a telescope.You will need a tripod with these for star gazing and I would recommend going on youtube to see the different binoc holders people have built and make one yourself.  When you're not using a tripod lean up against something or place them on something to steady them.  If you are just going to hold them you will get steadier images if you hold them out on the end near the large objective.These also work great for terrestrial viewing.  Remember though the minimum focus distance is 43 feet so they won't work for bird watching in the back yard.Overall these are great binocs for the price and I hope this review helps others decide whether or not to get these.  Let me put it this way liked them so much that I bought a second pair and sent them to my brother for Christmas.  He as crisp dark skies up in the mountains where he lives and can't wait to visit him again...when it warms up.
4,These binoculars do what they should. They are long and heavy; therefore a tripod or mount of some kind is necessary to keep them stable. They are not super high powered so they are not going to be comparable to higher powered binoculars or telescopes.  But they do what they are capable of doing very well. I am in a city with light pollution. These binoculars open up the night sky and make stars and  planets visible (from my backyard) that I would never be able to see with the naked eye. The view is very different & much better (in my opinion) than looking through one eye with a comparable power telescope. I have no complaints- but seeing through this pair makes me want to see even more so I am considering buying a more powerful pair or a small (but more powerful) telescope.  If these binoculars are what you can afford and you want to stargaze I would say not to hesitate to buy these. But if you can afford a more powerful pair of binoculars I would encourage you to get the most powerful pair you can afford. If you are looking for binoculars for terrestrial viewing- bird watching or something like that they would be great at long distances. My observation is that these binoculars are not capable of focusing on nearby objects (closer than 45 - 50 feet) so I cannot use them for bird watching in my small yard.
5,I was surprised at the quality of these binoculars. For one thing the exit pupil is nice and round with no cut-off edges or gray "corners" indicating that cheap glass was NOT used in the prisms; they used decent-quality high-index glass. This translates to less light lost out of the prisms. In daylight observing terrestrial objects there is some slight chromatic aberration visible at edges which suggests where they saved money and why these cost $80 instead of $400; the lens doublets in the objectives aren't all that.  However these are designed for celestial not terrestrial observation and I suspect this won't matter much.  That remains to be seen (pun intended) because one of the things I want to do with these is observe "naked eye" objects like M31 and Saturn.  If I find any unpleasant surprises I will post them here. There is one tiny "wart" worth mentioning: in order to use the included tripod mount (and with 15X binoculars one expects to use a tripod) one removes a dust cap covering one of the hinge bearings.  This appears to expose the hinge to dust and grime while the tripod mount is in use.  It makes me think that this tripod mount was an afterthought. This feature could be better. But this is a fairly small complaint not even enough for me to knock of one star.FOR THE PURPOSE INTENDED (which I will say again is NOT counting the stitches on a football at the stadium) these are an excellent bargain.  Which explains why so many reviewers recommend them.
3,i was looking for my 1st Binos and i tried to research a lot about Binos then in the end i found that 15*70 is reviewed by many customers so i made decision but when i received I concluded my choice was not ok. 1st thing is that it came with misalignment  i.e need collimation which is stressful. 2ndly also ordered the cemetron 7*50 together which is very useful to use due to high field of view. these are heavy and needed tripod. i am giving 3 stars because the collimation is big issue so i cant return it. for the price it is ok. but not very good decision . i would say buy lighter and big FOV binos for stargazing or buy a telescope for zoomed astronomy.
5,I can easily see the moons of Jupiter.  Not surprisingly it is jittery.  BUT I haven't yet tried with the tripod adapter.  Quite honestly I was hoping to get a better look at comet Leonard 2021/A1.  I think I saw it one morning but it was not the binoculars fault.  There were too many trees in the way.  Unfortunately weather hasn't been cooperating yet as it has been too cloudy.  Luckily it is not too late yet.In all honesty they are heavy.  That is not surprising as they are big.  The strap that came with it will help but it is such a narrow strap it's not real comfortable.  I will be swapping the strap with my other 10x Nikon binocs strap as it's padded and wider.  Optics-wise I am very pleased with the nice bright clear view.  I'd say it was a great purchase all things considered.
4,Para el precio estÃ¡n buenos buen material ...
5,I cannot believe the value and price combo of these.The columnation of mine were a little off but 5 minutes and a 5/64" jewelers flatblade took care of that. Based on how the binoculars prisms are installed (wedged in place with a pair of leaf springs) I can see there might be a periodic need to touch up the columnation so its probably good to learn to do it.The body of each objective lens carrier is plastic and I found the prism housings are cast from metal. The exterior of the glasses appear to be reasonably well finished and there are rubber grips covering the prism housings to make handling them a little more secure.I find the binoculars are bright and clear with an image as good as the stability of the tripod or monopod the which you have them mounted.  At this magnification hand use is difficult to impossible so I recommend a good stable tripod and adapter.  Which brings me to the only thing I dont like about the package.  The binocular mounting adapter supplied is simply too flimsy to work with something this heavy.  The adapter will oscillate about the pan axis when anything is disturbed and this will go on for quite a long time. The design could have worked with a higher modulus plastic resin perhaps with a fiber fill but it wasnt and doesnt.  I have a 3rd party adapter coming to correct this but I have read that if one fills the voids within the outline of the beam of this adapter with something like 2-part epoxy the stability increases a good deal.  I havent tried this but it could work.Edit 1/6/16: The 3rd party adapter I ordered has been delayed a bit and my new tripod was scheduled for delivery today so I went ahead and filled the recesses of the adapter with 2 part epoxy today.  This evening the tripod arrived and with the mostly cured epoxy filled adapter I was able to do a little star gazing.  I must say the adapter with the added epoxy is way more stable. No more oscillations.  For what its worth I used West System 2 part epoxy resin and hardener that I have on hand for repairs to our windsurfers. It would probably cost one more to buy a package with the amount I used in it than the cost of a better adapter but I had it on hand and am not expecting to use it up on board repairs so it cost me nothing.
5,Husband loves them!
5,I was hesitant to purchase these after reading several reviews mentioning bad collimation and "you get what you pay for". I finally decided to take a leap of faith due to the incredibly low price and the universally praised Celestron brand. After using them extensively for a week I can say without a doubt I am incredibly happy I took the chance!Let me get this out of the way: My pair have absolutely no collimation problems! It was the first thing I checked for and I was very happy and relieved to see that I had non of the issues mentioned in the negative reviews.The package includes the binoculars a carrying case tripod adapter strap and a microfiber cloth. The eyepieces and lens all have respective covers. While the lens covers are fantastic the eyepiece cover leaves much to be desired. It doesn't fit well and it consistently falls off. A minor detail perhaps but on cold nights in humid Florida condensation is a hassle for stargazing and it's important to have proper fitting covers to prevent dew from forming when you get back into a heated environment! Thankfully the eyepiece cover is the only negative thing I have to say in this review and for the most part it doesn't affect the primary use of the binoculars whatsoever!The construction is amazing considering the very low price ($59.59 as of 15 January 2012). There is nothing cheap feeling or looking about the binoculars and they feel wonderful to hold. That said they're quite big. You can certainly use them with your hands but after five minutes I think the layman will get tired. As such I've been propping it on my old camcorder tripod using the included adapter.The views these binoculars give are nothing short of breathtaking. Even pointing them at a dark patch of sky reveals hundreds of beautiful stars. On my first cloudless night I was able to see Jupiter with four of its moons and a beautiful nebula near Orion's Belt. I read you can get great views of galaxies (particularly Andromeda!) with these binoculars but to be honest as an amateur stargazer I've been having too much fun just finding and memorizing all the wonderful stars and their constellations. Orion's Belt Betelgeuse Rigel and Sirius look incredible!Words can't begin to express how it feels to observe these stellar objects. To see with your very eyes how beautiful the universe is and to realize that no matter what happens to you or the entire planet the universe will continue blasting through space. We are only a speck and these binoculars confirm that!
5,I'm a newcomer to backyard astronomy.I have a crummy little telescope that really made me dislike my new hobby.Then I found out about these babies.I haven't used them at night yet but for daytime terrestrial viewing these are AMAZING.Crisp clear optics. No collimation required ( at least for my set but being a binocular guy i always have a jewelers screwdriver nearby...)I was instantly able to spot lear-jets at various altitudes and by spot I mean count the windows.Tonight we are king to have flawless skies and I intend to get the fire pit roaring and stare off into space with the best set of binoculars i've ever owned....Update: One week later....HOT DAMN. I had one good night this week. And I was all over it.Jupiter is resolved as a bright disc. Fine details don't make it through but a few Jovian moons are Visible.Saturn is seen as an 'Eared' disc but you can def. tell it's Saturn. No moons are visible now but Saturn is pretty far away at the moment.M31 eludes me still. But I am confident that under dark enough skies I'll get her.The Pleiades are explosive.I live at sea level in Central Long Island so light pollution and sub par skies are the norm.These binoculars are a must for any Astrology or Optics enthusiast. Sturdy handy and overall one of the most impressive buys I've ever made on Amazon.I intend to get the largest pair of Celestron Skymasters within the next 6 months.Update: 7/14/2016I've had these for a year and a half now. I've taken them to Lake George NY many times and have used them extensively for terrestrial and astronomical viewing.With these I've seen the Triangulum of the Orion Nebula the moons of Jupiter the "Ears" of Saturn the Pleadies and for the first time just recently (mostly thanks to increased elevation) the Andromeda Galaxy and the amazing clusters around Casseopeia.I would buy again but they are still like new.Update: 6/07/2017There are certain times in your life when you look back at a purchase and say: "Yup- that was a good one."Let me tell you this is that purchase. At least for me.I've had these babies since 2014. Travel everywhere with them in all kinds of conditions and they're still like new. I continue to enjoy them as does the family.If you want a great pie of binoculars for a reasonable price- look no further.
5,thanks it's great.
5,I read the reviews and when the price dropped back down to $49 I could not resist. When They arrived I finally got to see that they are rather large. My 7X50 binoculars are big compared to the typical pair but were dwarfed by this Giant. The optics looked well made as did the body that held the prisms. The eyepieces and the ends that held the objective lenses looked a bit sketchy. This was especially true of the rubber parts and rubber coatings on those areas. There was some extra flashing and the rubber on the objective lens housing was a little baggy. The focusing mechanism was a bit stiff but quite precise. It also did not move as one looked through the pair.A tripod mount is a good thing to have and this came with one. Ten power is the usual limit for hand holding and at 15 power the user may need some help. I quickly found the tripod mount was rather flimsy and would wobble left and right. This was quickly remedied by filling all voids in the tripod mount with epoxy putty. The $5 spent was far less than buying a more substantial mount and I doubt if other mounts wouldnow be as strong.Now that the binoculars could be put on a sturdy stand I tried them out by looking at a street sign that was about 500 yards away. ( I checked and it is a half mile!)  One could not only read the street name but the smaller numbers on it as well. These were about 2 - 3 inches tall. The optics at least in the center are very good. There are some uncoated lens surfaces within the binoculars as flaring and ghosting were sometimes issues in the daytime. Contrast was good but lower than in binoculars with high quality coatings.At night the high resolution and light gathering were great helps. Contrast was good but would be better with better coatings. However it would no longer be in the same price range. They are a great thing to own. One can grab the pair go outside and do some quick star gazing without the need to set up anything. One can put it on a tripod for an even better view but that is still easier than using a telescope.The optics are very good and I can live the shortfalls of the body. The cost is well worth what you get.
5,I've always been interested in space and I love science in general but up to this point I have never had my own telescope or binoculars for looking up at the stars. I finally decided to make a purchase this year in order to satisfy my own curiosity and to hopefully spread some of that wonder to my boys aged 12 9 and 6. So I wanted something that would work for the whole family.I wasn't sure at first if I wanted a telescope or binoculars. I settled on binoculars as I felt it would give me the best flexibility. I figured that my boys might become bored with me taking minutes to align a telescope. I couldn't have been more pleased with this purchase because the most unexpected thing happened. All three of my boys were utterly amazed with what they saw.In our first night we were able to see Jupiter and two moons. Yes they are fairly small dots but you can see them! There is something transformative that happens when you can see it for yourself. Of course it doesn't hold a candle to the pictures you see on the computer and I was really worried about the boys being disappointed. But quite the opposite. It became more real more personal to them. And for me and my wife as well.On another clear night I had them sit at our patio table with their elbows up on the table to stabilize the binoculars and look at the moon. Wow look at all the craters! They loved it.About a week later my son came back from school and decided on his science project. He wants to build a Dobsonian telescope.  This from a kid that just likes to play Minecraft and not leave the house. Really? Right on!This past weekend we went to our first public star party at a local observatory. They all loved the experience. And they all argued over who got to look through the binoculars. We saw other stars and nebula that we had never seen before.So I could talk about how lightweight and sturdy these binoculars are how easy they are to use the images they provide and other technical specifications. But to me what really matters is that this inexpensive pair of binoculars has instilled a sense of wonder and amazement in my children that may very well last them a lifetime.
4,A really good value for the price. Shipping was on schedule and well packaged. I give it 3 3/4 stars.Thanks to Amazon and customer reviews I had a good idea what to look out for.Several pros and cons were apparent.PROs: I ordered these primarily for astronomy viewing.  Pretty good optics for the price. Features multicoated optics and water resistant case and a nice carry bag.Eye relief is gracious- no problem even with eyeglasses. IPD focus and diopter controls all smooth and seem to stay put. Handheld is difficult due to the bulk and I had to use a tripod to get steady views especially for astronomy observing (my Dolica was barely up to the challenge) but I seemed to get pretty good pinpoints for stars at least in the central FOV. I'm sure this will serve as an excellent low-power wide-angle telescope.CONs: I need to number these. 1. Straight from the box it was Out of Collimation. Celestron's instructions make a rather stupid statement that this is normal and tolerable with 15x and above and fail to tell you how to realign!  To the contrary- collimation is VERY important at higher magnifications and VERY easy to correct. Rather than return the unit I found a collimation article at Oberwerk's website and fixed this myself [The adjustment screws are under the rubber grips at about 2:00 on the (rhs) main body].2. The tripod adapter is worthless for this bino. It flexes wayyyyy too much and cannot handle the weight. I swapped it with a metal adapter from my 8x40 Barska and now both are tripod friendly again.3. I did notice some optical degradation toward the edge of the FOV. And I think there was some minor internal reflections at night with bright stars- probably due to not 'fully' coated.  All Minor and acceptable.4. The IPD range seemed restricted at the low end: too wide for my daughter.5. Diopter indicator underneath seems like it's in a truly hidden location.  Eyepiece covers don't fit tight and fall off. Again- all minor and acceptable.Overall- A really good value for the price. Quite useful for both terrestrial and astronomy viewing especially as a compliment to lower magnification binoculars.
4,Having never had any kind of binoculars in my life I made a mistake of assuming that any kind of optical device has a zoom (hey my $10 digital camera has it!) it didn't even come to my mind it's possible for binoculars not to have a zoom. It's like assuming a car won't have a steering wheel or something. Oooops. These don't. Apparently 300+ reviewers that gave it 5 stars don't care about this completely insignificant and unnecessary function. I do so I will have to return these and buy a zoom model. These binoculars are fine I looked through them for about 2-3 minutes but the 15X zoom is surprisingly very weak and unsatisfying. I have a condo with a 180 degree city view and downtown with all the skyscrapers is less than a mile away but these don't really provide satisfactory level of closeness even for objects this close. I mean the skyscrapers appear to be close-ER but nowhere close enough to get interesting enough to discern any fine detail or peek into offices. You can't really see people on the street close enough to see faces either. I couldn't get them to focus right and I did get a little headache (still feel somewhat nauseous typing this) but I didn't spend too much time with them so I don't know if it would get better. So these will go back to Amazon and I will probably be shopping for much stronger binoculars and a tripod. I also found the binoculars barely fitting my interpupilary distance I don't have a big head or wide-set eyes but I had to spread the eyepieces to the max and even then they were fitting me barely I still could use 3-5mm more of width. They're heavy as a boulder but I guess that's to be expected. As I said these are my fist binoculars so I won't comment on quality aspect but as a terrestrial viewing device I found these to be disappointing and weak even for someone with NO expectations like me. Ok for the price I guess but definitely NOT ok as an entertainment device even for something basic as city gazing.
3,These are my experiences with this product.  First off a little background.  I am not a hardcore astronomer.  I had recently been to an astronomy gathering where there were many huge telescopes and a few binoculars.  I was interested and wanted to take up the hobby.  The advice that I got was to start with some binoculars.  These seem like an amazing deal.  $60 for binoculars with 70mm optics.  Everyone told me to spend about $200 for a 7x50 but I bought these.  The binoculars came with problems.  It was not collimating properly and I was getting double vision.  I saw many reviews listing this problem but I bought them anyway.  For this reason alone I will be returning them.  However I will not be asking for a replacement for the following reasons.  As many before have already mentioned 15x power needs a tripod.  Not just any tripod will do.  I used a camera tripod that I estimate weighs 10 pounds and it is just not stable enough.  You WILL need a heavy solid tripod 30-40 pounds or so.  The mount attaches to the binoculars at the body which is far away from the very heavy tubes with 70mm glass at the end.  So if you shake or bump them they will stay shaking back and forth for a while.  A better design would have the big metal brace and mount in the middle like the larger ones.  They say long eye relief but without folding the rubber eye cups back you will constantly bump them and then you have to wait till they stop shaking again.  I do not wear glasses and this is still a problem.So what can you see with them?  Well stars turn into bright points in the sky.  Can you see the rings of Saturn? No.  Saturn is just a bright star.  Can you see the 4 Galilean moons of Jupiter?  Yes.  But what you see is little dots around the planet and Jupiter just looks like a large white spot.  There is no detail with these.  I tell you this so you don't expect any bands of color or anything spectacular.  Looking for nebulae or galaxies?  If you had a very good tripod then i suppose it is possible.Bottom line.  If you want to see all the stars and constellations then get a 7x50 pair and spend a little money on them.  If you want to see objects in space get a large telescope.  I really don't see where these are valuable for astronomy.  They might have some use for viewing terrestrial objects but again they need a good tripod.  Not for taking to a football game.  Save your money.
5,Celestron offers amazing quality at a value price. I own quite a number of their products and have also given them as gifts. This particular binocular is about the practical limit of what you can carry with you. No vigorous hiking or mountain climbing without a binocular chest harness as these things are LARGE and heavy. Build quality focus clarity and ruggedness are excellent. I use them for wildlife observation and these well get you up close and personal. Comes with a tripod mount adapter which is really the best use but I find that a tree or post to brace your hand hold is adequate to stabilize the 15x image. The 12x version which I also own is more suitable for free hand holding.
4,The views are very clear and bright.  I dont believe you will find a better set anywhere near this price.  Im very pleased with the performance.They are huge binoculars though and heavier than I had imagined.  I almost want to say that a tripod is a must because its nearly impossible to hold them steady enough to tell what youre seeing at night.  The problem with the tripod though is that while an adapter is included and is fairly bulky/sturdy looking it is not sturdy and allows the binoculars to wobble back and forth like a spring .  I will be looking for some sort of metal tripod mount which should resolve the issue.  I really wish the tripod adapter would have been made out of a material that didnt allow them to spring back and forth.As Ive said - the optics are great and especially at this price you wont find a better pair for twice the money or more than twice.  Just understand they are heavier than they look which makes viewing overhead in longer sessions uncomfortable without a tripod.  Also keep in mind the tripod adapter included is not sturdy and you must use force to hold them onto the tripod to try to stabilize them some whereas other pairs Ive used did not have this problem and while the others would shift around while adjusting focus etc - they didnt bounce around like these.  The mount helps but its not much help.The focus knob is easy to adjust and is easily accessible.  I can see where some reviews said its easy to move the focus on accident but for me I move across the sky and frequently adjust it anyway.  I didnt notice this as a problem.  You can adjust these to fit your eyes and you can adjust the focus of each eye independently so that when adjusting the main focus both eyes can see clearly if one eye isnt exactly the same as the other.
3,In terms of image quality I give em a 4 out of 5.  They're collimated ok and let in a fair bit of light with a decent FoV and plenty of eye relief and large exit pupil diameter.  Compared to my Nikon 10x42s though which give me a razor sharp image I feel like pinpoint light sources (stars and lights on the horizon 20 miles away) though the Celestron Skymaster's are showing a little smearing (pinpoint lights are slightly oval) as though there's some chromatic aberration even in the center of the frame.  Since I bought these for astronomy and the great Jupiter/Saturn conjunction specifically that was a disappointment.  They're OK but not great.I had to take off another star because despite the product listing showing a tripod adapter and the description listing it mine did *not* include one.  Because these are 15x binocs are they are mostly useless without a tripod so even though I was planning to buy a better adapter I needed the one promised in the box just to use em at all.  Obtaining a tripod adapter sooner cost me more time and money.  Also the included lens caps just *barely* hang onto the objective lens end (falling off randomly as you pull the binocs out of the bag) and the cap  for the eye pieces is too wide and doesn't stick on at all.  It just "rests" on top and falls off immediately.Attached is a photo shot with a cell phone adapter of the city about 10 miles away  and the airport lights on the horizon about 30 miles away.  Live view is obviously a bit sharper (can read the big signs on the buildings with my eyes).  Mainly just showing that it is possible to fill the camera's frame with the view through the eye piece.
4,Received my order today (1 day earlier than expected) of the Celestron SkyMaster 15X70 binoculars. They were nicely packed in their box and could hardly wait to see how well they worked compared to my older Bushnell 10X42 pair.  They really are heavier but that's understandable since they are considerably larger in length and seem to be well built for the price. I paid $69 and FREE 2-day shipping and it was worth it!  They definitely bring in objects closer and require a steady hold because of the higher magnification. I do have a camera tripod I might try and use in the next few days to see how that helps. Of course it comes with the tripod adapter as they mentioned and also a manual explaining some basic info.  Also a strap and case. (The strap for the binoculars is a little cheap and holding that weight around your neck needs a wider padded one but can't really complain since the binoculars work great out of the box)  Happy I never had issues with the focus and the other issues people mention sometimes with a cheaper end binocular. I purchased these for two reasons. One is to see if I can spot aircraft flying at 40000 ft because I currently am enjoying a app that is also on the Internet called PlaneFinder.  It's interesting to say the least. The other reason is for looking at stars etc.  I suggest working out with some arm weights if you plan on holding these for long periods of time.  It seems like it gets easier the more you use them.  I recommend these to anyone with a tight budget. I'm sure there are better quality brands out there but why spend hundreds of dollars unless you plan on using them everyday?  These will do just fine for the average person and even a professional.  Buy them at this price and you won't be sorry. If you can find them cheaper then even better!  Just make sure what you are buying.
4,I purchased these binoculars from Amazon a few days before going on vacation to an area with good skies for stargazing.  However when I received them I saw double images.  Rather than sending them back and not getting a replacement in time for my trip I decided to void the warranty and fix them myself.I have a narrow IPD (57mm) and the minimum IPD for these binoculars is 56mm.  Despite my IPD being larger than the minimum I could not bring the lenses close enough together.  I had to file the hinge to allow me to get a more narrow IPD with these binoculars.  This won't be a problem for vast majority of people.  Smaller persons should be aware that due to manufacturing tolerances the minimum IPD may be a millimeter or two larger than the stated one.  Despite all that work I still had the issue of double images.  I had to remove the rubber grip from the right side and adjust the screws to align/conditionally collimate the binoculars.  After about an hour of fiddling with these binoculars they worked great!These work better with a tripod but I can still hold them in my hands without getting really frustrated by shaky images.  Objects are bright sharp and clear.  On the trip my friends commented that they liked these 15x70 binoculars much more than my 10x50 ones.  These are great for the times you want to check out the sky without having to drag out a big telescope.  I also use them to spot deep sky objects before I point my telescope at them.In conclusion these binoculars are great for the price.  The catch is that there is a chance you might get one that's misaligned.  If you do get bad one you have to send it in for replacement/repair or to align them yourself.  Search the web and  you will find there are a few websites that have detailed instructions on how to align/collimate these binoculars.
5,I  read a lot of reviews and did a lot of research on this item and other similar items before deciding to purchase the 15x70 Celestron Skymaster Binoculars. This is not the first Celestron product I've purchased and I'm always very happy with all their products.  I was able to get a few minutes of use out of these just in time for the annual Persied meteor shower.  The binoculars were not as heavy as I expected and I was able to use them for brief periods (sitting in a lawn chair) without a tripod.  I did not experience any colmination problems as others have reported and I suspect their problems may be due to their pupillary distance instead.  I have a rather narrow pupillary distance (distance between my pupils) and this caused me to have to adjust the binoculars to an almost uncomfortable position to eliminate the double image and optical aberrations that result in improper alignment of the eyepieces with the eyes.  One other issue I had is with the left eye focus adjustment.  It's not a problem with the binoculars but rather a problem with my eye sight.  I normally use my binoculars and telescopes without my glasses on but I could not adjust the left eyepiece enough to correct my poor vision in that eye.  I was able to put my glasses back on and adjust the rubber cups to allow for viewing with my glasses on and everything worked fine.  I would also add that this is the best pair of binoculars I've ever used with my glasses.  Usually viewing binoculars with glasses is very awkward but these worked great.  I'm looking forward to using these more.p.s.- For those of you trying to decide on buying binoculars or a telescope to start a new astronomy hobby my personal recommendation is to start with binoculars.  They are quick and easy to use until you are sure you really want to invest in a good $400+ telescope.  Even after I forked out $1200 for a high quality telescope I still used my binoculars almost as often.  Especially for comets and star clusters.
5,The Celestron 15x 80 binoculars are a great buy for someone who wants to do some back yard astronomy.  The first thing I will say is that you need a sturdy tripod in order to see anything  the high magnification makes holding them steady almost impossible. I also purchased a tripod adapter from Celestron the one that came with the binoculars is not quite solid enough. My sky is not very dark anyway and it was almost a full Moon last night so I tried the binoculars out on the Moon and was treated to a spectacular view! Crisp and clear the view was full of sharp detail. Tycho Crater showed off it's rays clearly  could see details in the Seas and the Highlands.I chose the 15 power because they still have a nice wide field of view. The higher power binoculars would bring things closer but I want to be able to "star hop" and the 15 power is a good ballance of power and wide field. I look forward to darker skys perhaps a short car ride away. I hope to see the Andromeda Galaxy the Orion Nebula as well as the Gallalean moons of Jupiter.These binoculars have smooth focus and work well with my eye glasses. The work well for looking at distant objects on land but you still need a tripod. These are not for bird watching or sporting events they are much too large and powerful for that. They are heavy and difficult to hand hold. It would be hard to track action with them.( For that use I would highly recommend 8x42 binoculars Celestron makes a great cheap waterproof pair of those too.) But they are great for astronomy much easier to set up and use than a telescope.  The wide field will provide beautiful star filled views of the night sky. These binoculars  are well made provide a sharp clear image and can be obtained at a great price. They are not waterproof or fog proof but if you store them properly  and don't dunk them in water they will give you a life time of exelent service. I highly recommend them.
5,I will not go in to any depth and detail on the pros and cons of these binoculars as other posters have already done this.What I will say is that I have had these for about a week now and I have used them for both nature observation and astronomy and in both they have performed really good.One of the cool things was that I watched a Merlin Hawk for nearly 20 minutes that was in a tree a block and a half away from my house. It was eating it's lunch in the tree. The image was crisp and clear and it felt like I was right there with it.Personally I am very happy with the purchase.Update: February 12 2013I have had these binoculars for 10 months now and so far I am still very pleased with the purchase. I found when using them for astronomy viewing it is much easier to lay down on the ground. So basically I get as conformable as possible. I take a blanket to lay on and 3 pillows. One pillow for my head and the other two I put on either side of my arms so I can rest my arms on. I find that makes it much easier to support the weight of the binoculars when using them for a long time.I have found the light gathering power of these binoculars is fantastic. A couple of weeks ago there were a rash of night time car break-ins in my neighborhood. So I grabbed my cell phone and binoculars turned off all the outside lights on my house and sat in a chair under a tree in my front yard and I used a TV tray as a rest for my arms and scanned the whole street for a couple of hours in the dark. Through them at midnight I could see a cat crossing the street a whole block away. Everything was clear and crisp through them in the dark. You would be amazed at the details you can see through them at night.Be it nature observing or astronomy these binoculars are really worth the investment.
4,Bought these for the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn 12/21/20.  First thing to know is that you cannot hold these binocs steady enough by hand to view anything you need a tripod they are heavy.  Another reviewer mentioned that the tripod adaptor was unsteady and that is true even a light breeze makes the binocs move.  I have had them out a couple of times since they arrived and with them mounted on a tripod I was satisfied with what I was able to see.  There was  a crescent moon and it was very clear and the detail of the craters was awesome.  Of the planets you can see the moons of Jupiter as tiny points of light and the rings of Saturn make it appear as an oval.  I live in the suburbs of a large city so the light pollution is pretty bad.  I think for the price they are a good starter for viewing the skies before you get a telescope.
5,The Celestron SkyMaster 15x70 binoculars are great for beginners such as myself for astronomy. They are very easy to use and allow you to help locate bright objects in the sky such as planets and stars and help you learn the constellations of the night sky. Observations through the Moon look amazing. Although they are only 15x magnification the SkyMaster binoculars allow you to see objects with a lot more clarity in particular the Moon. You will not be able to see any Deep Sky Objects like a Galaxy or Nebula however you will be able to see a lot more stars than you can with the naked eye and you will be able to see planets a little bit clearer. Planets will appear as just brighter objects so don't plan on seeing Saturn's rings or any detail on Mars such as a polar cap or anything on Jupiter.Despite what the binoculars can not do what they can do is get you started in finding constellations much easier and recognizing some of the most well known stars in the sky a lot faster and easier. In addition to astronomy the SkyMaster 15x70 binoculars are excellent for day time observations such as spotting wild life. These binoculars are an all around great pair of binoculars and give stunning clarity of what you are looking at due to the eye lens focus and the focus in the middle of the binoculars.Day time observations when you do this focusing the eye lens than the middle wheel allow for some stunning visuals of land marks and wild life. In the night sky this is also enhanced. Viewing Arcturus for example is much better than the naked eye as the clarity you get allows you to see more color.I would strongly recommend this product to anyone who wants to do day time observation such as hunting or anyone who wants to start astronomy or just wants a pair of binoculars for an easy pick-up-and-go observation. Compared to the military grade binoculars I used these are much much better in comparison. For the price tag $60 when I purchased them it can't be beat. Highly recommended.
5,So much more practical than lugging a telescope out to your favorite star gazing spot. It's not comparable in magnification but is much easier to spot that star you see and you can see the moons of Jupiter and Saturn's rings (barely) through this. The moon is spectacular as well. The separate focus for the eye pieces is great too it's a feature I'd never thought of after years of having just one adjustment. They are fairly big and the strap is not super comfortable to walk with so that's about the only downside. A nice padded strap would fix that. Or a daypack.
4,I bought these because I wanted a little more light gathering power than my Oberwerk 11x56's. The Celestrons checked out beautifully on a terrestrial view right out of the box I thought WOW! Night cometh and I set them up on a tripod along with the Oberwerks for comparison. It was immediately obvious that the Celestrons need to be collimated not unexpected what with shipping and banging around and all. And the 100+ degree heat they were subjected to. After waiting for them to cool down I managed to get them collimated without much trouble. Now to the views. Or lack of. I live in an extremely light polluted area. The only star I could see (without breaking my neck looking straight up) was Polaris. Not a bad choice for bino evaluation since I had these mounted on regular photo tripods and Polaris doesn't move appreciably. Let's get to the point: I could not get a tight sharp point on Polaris with the Celestrons like I could with the Oberwerks. On the other hand the dimmer stars that I could see were points and I could see more of them thru the Celestrons than with the Oberwerks. No surprise here 70mm objectives vs 56 mm. And that's the thing: I didn't buy these in order to evaluate the Airy disk on bright stars; I bought them to get wide-field views of relatively dim objects. So they apparently will do this job. The final decision was made by my 8-year old daughter who wants to be an astronomer. She looked through each in turn and without prompting said "Ooh I like this view the best" and that was through the Celestrons. I tend to have a super-critical eye and speaking of eyes I'm doing my eval thru multi-focal eyeglasses. I might not be the best judge of a pure 20/20 unclouded view. I'll take my kid's word for it.
4,Me gustan mucho tiene un exelente alcance es cierto que puedes localizar planetas. Pero asÃ­ como ver detalles de ellos. Es solo intuiciÃ³n de saber que ahÃ­ estÃ¡ elPlaneta que buscas no puedes ver detalles incisive con mi telescopio reflector de 102 mmm a 180 aumentos incisive a 220 aumentos no logrÃ³ ver detalles claros . ImagÃ­nense con los binoculares que tiene 70 mm x 15 aumentos. Cava seÃ±alar mis observaciones han sido en el patio de mi casa con toda la contaminaciÃ³n lumÃ­nica que puede aver desconozco como funcione el condiciones totalmente oscuras... OTRA COSA QUE QUIERO COMENTAR ES QUE LOQUE ME GUSTA DE ELLOS ES QUE PUEDES CONOCER LA POSICIÃN DE LAS ESTRELLAS CON SOLO VERLAS A TRAVEZ DE  LOS BINOCULARES POR QUE AUNQUE PARECEN  TODAS IGUALES DESPUÃS DE UN TIEMPO TE DARÃS CUENTA DE QUE  TIENEN PATRONES DISTINTOS EN CONJUNTOS CON OTRAS ESTELLAS MENOS LUMINOSAS... y asÃ­ te comienzas a ubicar en elCielo nocturno.. yo los recomiendo pero no esperes ver cosas maravillosas
5,I've used these binoculars for about 6 months now for night sky viewing.  I will say that my first pair came to me SIGNIFICANTLY out of alignment but the return process was very easy and I had my new pair before I even had time to ship the old one back - thank you Amazon.Now to the review:  they are far and away the best binoculars I've ever used for stellar and planetary viewing.  Over the winter (in Wisconsin so roughly zero degrees at night) in a fairly light polluted area I was able to watch and track Jupiter and its moons over a 3 week period was able to view Mars and my favorite Saturn.  I was able to discern a general shape of the rings that is to say you can see that the planet isn't spherical to your view and some nights you could see the shape of the rings pretty clearly but it really did depend on the day.  Anyone looking to be able to see individualized rings and/or Jupiter's storm stripes should stick to Google Images.It's amazing how many stars just "appear" when you point them at the sky nothing to the naked eye but the light gathering power of these is impressive for the package.  For the money I think these were a great buy and I will certainly be using them for many years.  My 3 year old enjoys checking out early moon rises poor guy has bed time before the stars are out and the eye pieces get pretty close to set for him to get some pretty quality views based on his descriptions of the "white dot at the bottom" I'm assuming he is at least making out Tycho.They were a little too heavy for me to be happy holding them by hand but with a decent tripod that issue is pretty much non-existent for me anymore.  Long story short I would buy these again.  You may start with a bad pair but stick with it for the price the value is great.
5,I just got into amateur astronomy about 6 weeks ago and based on the many positive reviews I read here I decided to give these a whirl since they are reasonably priced.  Just got them today.It is overcast right now so I only got to view the moon in between darks clouds and saw Venus.  I will make it my business to either update or post again but the few comments I want to make:  They are MUCH lighter than I thought.  Yes I had the shakes but not much different than my 10x50s.  My hands did not get tired after 15 minutes.  I was more annoyed that the clouds were in the way of my view than I was with the so called awkwardness of the binos.  My only complaint about Celestron (I have two other sets of binos by them) is that their straps and bag are FLIMSY!  I see that I have to purchase them elsewhere for optimal protection.  I am not as in a rush as I thought I would be to purchase a tripod.  They may not even been necessary with a bit of patience and positioning.I plan to look at Jupiter Saturday morning and review the planets I have previously saw and will definitely post back.  For now I say get them.  Celestron is the company that seems to deal with enthusiasts with limited funds but seem to come through with decent optics.***Update 11/12/10*** I have even more appreciation of these binoculars as I gain more experience.  Pleiades is phenomenal to see. Ditto for the Orion Nebula!  If you hold the binos at the front that may decrease the shakes a bit-or I lean on my gate or a car to steady them.  I have purchased a tripod since my last posting which is even better but I don't carry it around.  You can see Jupiter's 4 moons more details on the moon clusters and just for the heck of looking and identifying it later is equally as fun!  You don't have to spend a great deal of money to view celestial treats!
4,Better than expected for the price / requires heavy duty tripod to stabilize for best image when focusing on a single point.  I was surprised that they are also fairly usable when hand-held for short periods.  But tripod or other solid mounting/stabilizing is a necessity for more than a minute's viewing at a time which leads to....Problem: the included tripod adapter's knob crumbled in my hand like a cookie the first time I tried to attach it to the binoculars.  Whats left is a tiny metal stud that cant be tightened by hand and the location makes it nearly impossible to fit a small wrench or pliers on it to continue using it with the binoculars.  I filled out a help ticket on Celestron's website 5 days ago and got an immediate robo-reply acknowledging my request for a replacement adapter but the company has not contacted me yet with a response as to whether or not they will ship me a new (free) adapter like they should nor replied to my follow-up email request.  If they don't get back to me in a few days I will send it back to Amazon and lower my rating accordingly.  NOT a good impression of the company's customer service...I wouldn't want to take a chance on any of their more expensive products.Update: Celestron shipped me a replacement tripod adapter that arrived today and did not self-destruct when I attached it to the binoculars.  They could have been a little faster with that but they did come thru.  As a result -and based primarily on the low price- I am raising my rating to 4 starts from 3.
5,High Level:These are large binoculars.  From front to back they are nearly 11 inches long. These allow you to really scope out far off animals landscape features the moon and stars.  We also own some 10x25 folding binoculars and these clearly blow them out of the water.  If you aren't aware the "15" means it brings things 15 times closer to you and the 70 means how man mm the end lenses are (they let in a lot of light and have a wide field of view). They have a nice rubber finish and although some consider them "heavy" they are far lighter than I expected this large of binoculars to have.What you get:In the package we received the binoculars a tripod mount lense covers for all 4 lenses a neck strap and a carry bag that velcro closes the binoculars inside the bag a small cleaning cloth and basic instructions.Our uses:If you plan on looking for stars (which we do with our kids) you'll want a tripod only because it is hard to hold them perfectly steady.  We resort to resting our arms on the side of the car to steady the "dots" of distant stars.  If you look at the moon through these you'll see crater detail almost as good as an entry level telescope.  We've seen Venus Mercury and other planets.  We keep them in our camper for adventures outside the city (Looking around our campsite to the distant hills/mountains) or while around the campfire looking up at the stars.If you have expectations of hiking with them you will want to note the overall size.  I could imagine bird watchers enjoying the details but they are too large for long hikes unless seeing distant objects is your core mission.Summary:Many people say they aren't the "Best".  Well; the better ones cost almost 8x more.  For the money this is a high value product and one we are pleased with.
5,I somewhat recently sold my telescope as I wasn't getting much use out of it. The pacific northwest is not exactly a friendly place for sky gazing due to all the rain and especially at my house where I have a very small slice of open sky due to all the trees. I needed something small ultra-portable and with a wide field of view. Enter these.With 70mm lenses and 15x magnification they will pull in distant objects very nicely. They're big but not so huge they're unwieldy. If you have weak hands and wrists prolonged usage will probably become uncomfortable. Even if you're in great shape and strong after a while they will still start taking their toll. The nice thing is they come with a tripod mount so you can thread them onto one and offload all that weight for extended viewing.They function just like any other binoculars I've owned. They adjust for the width of your eyes and also have a diopter adjustment so you can use them without glasses. And of course there's an adjustment knob for focus. All of these especially the focus knob are butter smooth when you adjust them. They eyecups are comfortable made of soft rubber. The case is a standard run of the mill pouch with a cover that drapes over the top and fastens with velcro.The only thing I can ding these on is there is a bit of noticeable chromatic aberration. You'll see it when you're focused on a somewhat close object like the branch of a tree against a bright cloudy sky. The pink and green "shadows" indicative of aberration is there but not distracting However at under $70 at the time of this review I don't think anyone could expect optical performance of much pricier glass.So yes I would recommend these for checking out the heavens at night or for nature during the day. You get a lot of performance for the money.
5,This is my second pair of SkyMaster 15x70 binoculars...I still have the first also.  Although I'm into astronomy I primarily use these for watching wild game and hunting; and they have excellent performance...especially in low light.  The first pair got left out in a downpour recently and I ordered a second pair thinking they were ruined.  Fortunately Google and some investigation on my own showed me how to clean and dry them internally.  The first pair is back in fine working order.  I read some reviews about some being out of alignment or coming out of alignment.  I guess I've been lucky but I have not had that experience with these at all.  The new pair came out of the box giving great views.  The older pair I just put back together had to have the alignment tweaked for the first time when I put them back together which was not unexpected at all.  Took just a couple of minutes working with the screw under rubber cover on the top of the right grip.  5 stars overall simply because of the quality / price.  4 stars for stabilization as they can be hard to hold steady freehand for very long.  3 stars for lightweight...they are not but they're also not extremely heavy.  Picture quality is 4 stars as they aren't as good as any of my telescopes if you're into astronomy but most wouldn't notice the small aberrations at the edges on anything less than pinpoint stars.
5,These things are so badass for being as relatively affordable as they are. I'm really enjoying them. They don't focus on close up items so don't expect to be getting a zoom view on the spider webs just in front of you but anything that's I'd say more than 30 feet away comes into very clear view. When you're looking at things that are not too close but still within 80 yards or so you get this amazing 3d type effect between whats in focus and what's not. I think it's a combination of the shallow depth of field and the brightness of allllll that light coming in through the objectives that lend to this effect. It's quite something else. These are easy to use too. For objects that are not off in the far distance It's fairly easy to hold these steady enough to get a good look at the subject. However for objects far far away you'll want to either brace your arms against something to add stability or use a tripod. Either way one of those options will make it easy enough to keep these bad boys plenty steady for viewing. For instance if you were looking out the window of your car your could rest your elbows on the window sill and be fine. And like I said there's a ton of light coming in through those huge objective lenses so you're getting a wonderfully easy to make out image. The optics are not going to be on the level of swarovski but the image is still very very clear and wonderful to look at. I highly recommend these if you're not in desparate need of something compact. They are sizable but not as heavy as you would think. The included case is sufficient for protected the binocular however I do wish it had little compartments for stowing the lens cloth and tripod mount separately. But the binoculars themselves are fantastic at this price and seemingly sturdily built.
4,Pros:Nice views of deep skyHigh definition on nature viewsCould be heavy for some peopleMoon craters easy to watch.Cons:Lens protection's plastics fall down easilyNylon bag doesn't fit properly the binoculars I would recommend to add some extra protection for long trips.
5,I've always been fascinated by optical equipment and as a teenager collected catalogs from Questar Cave Optical and other manufacturers whose products I could only dream of purchasing.  Growing up in Southern California the Celestron company was just down the road in Torrance and their fine catadioptric telescope line with the distinctive orange tube was augmented by several astronomical binoculars.  The flagship at the time was a 11 x 70 behemoth described as a "porthole into the sky" - that magnification selected to produce a 7mm exit pupil the maximum for night viewing and the standard for an astronomical binocular back then.  I seem to recall that they sold for $150 which would be at least $500 in today's dollars.Since then I've lived in places with far worse viewing conditions than where I grew up.  A telescope requires clear skies and is a pain to set up and use.  Binoculars on the other hand just work; you take them out and focus them and you're done.  At 15 power they're strong enough to make out more detail than weaker units while still being easy to hold steady using the roof of a car or some other object.  I haven't been able to resolve Saturn's rings yet because with the humidity around here they fog up before I can see anything that detailed but I'm still optimistic.  I was able to conduct surveillance on a construction site with no problem.  For daytime terrestrial viewing they're remarkable although not something you would want to carry around your neck all day.These binoculars are solidly constructed and coated in rubber for protection.  Mine were advertised as "reconditioned" which judging from some other reviews may be better than new in some cases.  I've had no problems with focusing or collimation.  At $56 with free shipping you can't go wrong.
5,These binoculars were the start of it all: my official obsession with the night sky.  I had initially bought them to admire the Moon (which is beautiful in these) but I started wondering what else I could see with them.  The first clear moonless night I went out pointed these things in a random direction and WOW.  These binoculars revealed about 80% of stars I had no clue were there.  Viewing from the suburbs with bad light pollution I never expected such beautiful views.I proceeded to explore.  I was able to see the moons of Jupiter (though Jupiter is too bright in these to show detail) the rings of Saturn (that look more like ears from only 15x power) but what these things really bring out are the open clusters of stars.  Do some research on what "open clusters" are if you don't know because they are absolutely gorgeous in these; you don't expect to see such vibrant colors in stars until you get 15x closer.  As a matter of fact many folks with only a telescope are at a disadvantage when trying to view these simply because many open clusters are too wide for the narrow FOV of telescopes!Within a week of using them I knew I wanted a telescope and I love every second with it.  Now I frequently use the binoculars to view the Moon look at open clusters (and sometimes globular cluster though they look like a small faint smudge at only 15x power) and for ISS fly-by's.  I plan on taking them on a Caribbean cruise I'm taking in a few days and I'm quite excited for the dark dark skies of the Gulf.So whether you want to get a telescope or not I'd highly recommend getting these first; you're going to use them anyway and they're a steal for under $100.Indeed these binoculars have changed my life. :)
5,I shopped many sites for reviews on different giant binoculars for mostly astronomy. The Celestron Skymaster 15x70 constantly received high marks from novices like myself and experienced skywatchers. My first thought was to buy a telescope. But after attending my first amature astronomy night and seeing the work involved as well as suggestions by the amature astronomers to first start with binos this is what i decided to do.I received these binos well packaged and after removing them found no damage and in perfect order. Read the brief instructions inside and took them out that night. Looking at a half moon took me back. Could see many craters and mountains in surprising detail. Looking at various star clusters with the naked eye for comparison and then the binos blew me away.The visible stars increased many fold thru the binos. Clarity is amazing and i could not be happier with my purchase. They are a bit heavy and your arms do shake when holding them so do get a heavy duty tripod. Mine is on the way. Once you are able to stable them the view will even be better.For the price and quality view you get from these binos and if you don't want to spend a lot of money to start with then give these a try. They also have many desired features you would expect to find in much more expensive binos. After the detail i can see in thesei now find myself having "Bino fever" and am starting to look for even a larger size for future purchase. These are great easy to go to for a quick look with little fuss and great for young kids when using the tripod. The cost is low so you don't have to worry about damage plus they come with a lifetime no fault warranty.I have only so far used them in a pretty lighted area and am impressed. Can't wait to get out of town where it is very dark and see what i can see then.The wow factor should be greatly inhanced.
3,I would give 3 1/2 stars if that were possible. Make no mistake these are cheap binoculars. I already have a pair of mid range binoculars in 10x for any practical needs. I wanted these pretty much as a toy to be able to look at things that are really far away. I will be using them for star and moon gazing as well.First of all my pair came out of collimation. I knew that this was a common problem with these when I ordered. Luckily this is a pretty easy fix all you need is a set of mini screw drivers. There is a great you tube video showing how to fix this.The focus knob has a TON of adjustment in it which is good for getting it right where you want it but it takes a while to get there if you are far off. The diopeter knob also seems to have a lot of adjustment in it. The clarity of these are about what I expected from a cheap pair of binoculars. By no means will you have trouble seeing things but it just doesn't have the crisp look and feel of more expensive ones. If you are used to $150+ binoculars you will be a little disappointed. If you aren't you will be happy with the clarity. The eye relief is also pretty long on these and the eye cups have two distance positions. I keep the eye cups out and it is just a hair too far from the lens which means I have to push on the eye cups to get it just right. The in position is way too close to the lenses and gives me a headache.The other thing to consider is if you are looking for a good all around pair of binoculars these are not the best choice. These are very large and have a limited field of view because of their power. Something in 8x or 10x is much better suited for a good all around pair of binoculars. Where these really shine is if you have already found what you want to look at and you don't need a wide field of view.Overall for the money they are good binoculars. If you want them to look at stuff that is really far away for shorter periods of time I would say this is it. If you are planning on spending all day looking through them I would spend more money.
4,A fine pair of binoculars! I use them regularly and am rarely disappointed. They allow me to see probably at least 5 times as many stars as are visible to the naked eye and they frame larger open clusters beautifully. These are actually my favorite instrument to view celestial highlights such as the Orion Nebula and the Pleiades cluster as they allow enough light for the finer details to emerge without losing a sense of the bigger picture with high magnifications.There are only a couple of drawbacks hence the 4 stars rather than 5:-You will most certainly need a tripod. I knew that when I purchased these but for casual observing I still stick to my 7X50 cometrons. I use these for longer evenings of more focused observing from darker locations than my backyard. I use the Orion Tritech II Field Tripod and am able to have very steady views (In fact of several tripods I have used this is by far the best one I have tried).-You will need a more sturdy tripod adapter than the one provided with these binoculars. I use the Barska tripod adaptor (also available from Amazon) and it is quite sturdy. The plastic adaptor that comes with these binoculars is just too wobbly and unstable.Other than these minor things I am very pleased with this pair of binoculars. Just know that you will need a sturdy tripod and adaptor to use them and that because of this the binoculars are more useful for the serious observer/amateur astronomer rather than the casual backyard stargazer.
4,For the money paid I am real happy with these not only did I get them quickly (1 wk from the day I ordered) they came well packaged work flawlessly out of the box glass is real clear and boy can I see things far. I bought 10x50 Gordons from Harbor Freight for $20 on sale which were OK for what I was using them for spotting at gun range but when I got my AR15 and moved to the 100 yard targets I could hardly see my holes so I gave them away and did alot of reading on reviews of different makes and models. I was thinking I'll spend $100 but after reading specs and other user storys I figured I need to stay under 15-20 as going fro 10 power to 15 was 50% increase and I still need to view things at 40-50 feet. So I narrowed it down to 15/20 power in either 60 or 70 objective lens. I was able to get these for $60.95 OTD and does the job I need them to do. With a 70 objective they are bright and now I'll use them at night to star gaze and look at full moons. I have nothing to compare them to that is better quality they smoke my Gordon's demoed some Barska 15x70 and some others at Big5 and they were really poor in clarity fully zoomed were blurry for the same price range. Anyone looking for good 15x70 Binoc's at a low price will be happy with these. Some viewers say they are heavy for they are not and handled them for 30 mins without any issues. I can see if you star gaze you either may need to lay down or put them on a tripod. They included the trip pod mount cleaning tissue neck strap and lens covers and carrying bag.
5,The first pair was uncollimated so I saw two birds two Moons etc. The seller quickly replaced the binoculars with a collimated pair. Good binoculars for browsing the sky not too heavy if you hold them for one to two minutes. When held by hand they shake too much to see fine detail or to easily observe the moons of Jupiter â use a tripod to get the full benefit of the 15X magnification. They perform well in a dark sky. The light-gathering power of the 70 mm objective lenses brings out fainter objects; many stars fuller detail of deep sky objects such as the outer rim of M31. The binoculars are popular with friends and family who grab them and start using them in a way that they do not do with a telescope.The tripod mount has a steel screw but unfortunately the binoculars have a brass thread. After you screw the mount into the binoculars a few times the steel damages the softer brass thread and they do not fit so well. I wish that the binoculars had a steel thread.
4,Love these. I have two telescopes and these are added for browsing the night sky ( C11 and 127 Explore Scientific ED ). But to get good views you need a tripod. Have a sturdy mount for that. The adapter to the binos is very very sloppy. Wiggles side to side under slight touches or vibrations! Otherwise very awesome optics with these.Can see Saturn's rings (slightly) and Jupiter's moons easily. CAN'T WAIT TO USE THEM IN SOME BORTLE CLASS 1-3 skys!
5,Everyone seems to be raving about these binoculars.  For working binoculars at the price charged you cant go wrong.  Unfortunately the pair i got had a loose ocular.  So loose i was able to unscrew it by finger touch. It was in the original packaging and did not appear to be a return.  The binoculars looked like it came straight from the factory in the condition received and was not caused in shipment from amazon.Needless to say it was way out of collimation when i tightened it up.  I looked through one ocular at a time and liked the quality of the optics for the price.  So i just need to get a pair that are functional i.e. in proper collimation and properly tightened.  Amazon is sending a replacement.  I give the product two stars for now.  One hopeful star that i will get a working  pair next time and one star on the quality of the service of amazon.  If the replacement binoculars are as good as everyone says i will update and upgrade my review.  I am in manufacturing myself so i know some defective items will get through quality control no matter what in a mass production setting.  So i will be patiently waiting for my replacement binoculars.This review is just to give a heads up that there are some defective units floating around so dont be surprised if you have to return it.Update 22 Nov 2011.  Got the replacement binocs within 2 days of notifying amazon.  Tonite i observed jupiter and could make out the galilean satellites on either side of the big planet.  The pleiades were spectacular.  The collimation was acceptable.  Incredible buy and now it is even less expensive than when i bought it a month ago!!!  Amazing when you consider that i bought a similar pair of binocs 10 years or so ago for 300 dollars.
2,Got these in July and was exctied to use them.  only problem is there are always two images and I cannot get it to adjust to one image.  I even tried to use a tripod and it did not help.Hope Celestron will have some help for me.
4,These binoculars are well made and provide good clear views for the price.  However they do require the use of a tripod or some other means for keeping them steady while viewing astronomical targets.  Because of their size and weight it is impossible to use them hand held without very far away small and often faint objects moving around too much to study them.  So if you are going to buy these for astronomy and you do not already have a tripod you need to consider buying one along with these binoculars.  Unfortunately that makes them a bit less portable for spur of the moment observations.  I find them to still be easier to travel with and set up than my small Celestron telescope.  The image is clear and the light gathering capabilities are excellent.  I look forward to using them more extensively when the weather cooperates and there are clear skies in my area.  It has been suggested elsewhere (by Gary Seronik of Sky and Telescope Magazine) that the optimal configuration for binoculars that are intended for astronomy are 10 x 50.  This is supposed to be enough power and light gathering ability to see most celestial targets that are recommended for viewing with binoculars.  This also provides a large enough field of view (not to mention a smaller lighter form factor) that the hand held steadiness problem is not as severe so as to make use without a tripod impossible.  If you are willing to use a tripod and you want to get good clear views of the night sky these binoculars are a good relative low cost investment.  If you want greater portability and can accept somewhat less power and light gathering capabilities you may want to consider a 10 x 50 pair.
5,Perfect gift.
5,I have always been interested in astronomy so recently I decided to take the plunge and purchase a telescope.  I spent a few days perusing reviews and researching beginner amateur astronomy telescopes and found that a good 'starter' telescope costs roughly 300 bucks.  I also found however that most people suggest you start out with a good pair of binoculars.  After researching binocs for a few days I finally settled on these.These binoculars come in a nice padded case and include rubber caps for all the lenses.  They are almost hilariously large to those who are not familiar with binoculars designed for astronomy.  They have good eye relief and eyepieces that fold down for people who wear glasses (like myself).  Focus can be adjusted for each eye independently the middle knob controlling both eyes and the right eyepiece turning to adjust just the right side. They also come with a tripod mount but imho the best way to use them is to lay in a partially inflated inflatable raft a common method when using binoculars for astronomy - the pressure of your legs allows you to adjust the level of your head and you have something to rest your arms on works great!The images they produce are incredible to someone with little experience in advanced optics. I have used them to observe stars globular clusters galaxies (which admittedly look like nothing more than cloudy spots among the stars) satellites the moon as well as Jupiter and it's four moons.  The magnification is only 15x which is high for binoculars but low when you get in to telescope ranges.  I have not been able to make out the color bands of Jupiter for instance.  However anything higher and you get too much arm shaking for them to be useful without a tripod.  One final tip... hold them down near the ends and they will be a lot more steady.In short... great buy! I absolutely love mine.
4,These are my first pair of binoculars.  I wanted binoculars that I could use for both terrestrial and astronomy veiwing.  This particular model was said to be a nice mid-way option and I would agree.  I like the simplicity of grab-and-go.  I have a telescope and it takes some work to transport and setup.  Of course these binoculars are not nearly as powerful as a telescope; however for general stargazing they work fine.  The view of the moon is good but don't expect too much when looking at the planets.I would have given them a 5 star rating except that my left 70mm lens came with 2 scratches.  Luckily the worst one is near the edge of the lens.  Also there is one rather large spec of dust on the inside of that same lens.  I can't tell that the view is affected in any way from either of the imperfections.  All the lenses were dirty but when I cleaned them I was impressed at just how well the binoculars could be focused to produce a crystal-clear view with almost no loss of focus around the edges.  I guess I was fortunate to get a well collimated pair.  It was for this reason I did not return the binoculars because of the scratches.  I was afraid to trade one flaw for others which could be worse.  For the price I am content with what I got.Most people will probably find these binoculars to be a little heavy to hold for an extended period of time but with a tripod I find they handle well.  My tripod pick was the Targus Digital TG-6660TR.
5,Just received my Celestron SkyMaster Giant 15X70 Binos today 30/7/2014.  I was worried about the 1 and 2 star reviews but I bit the bullet and decided to try them out.  As most has said right out of the box these are out of collimation.  Man was I peeved.  The images were doubled and slightly shifted to the right.I decided to call Celestron and see if I could fix these bad boys myself.  You won't believe how easy it was to fix them.  A simple twist of the  tubes (the objective lens tube) and viola!  Simple as that.  The gentlemen was very kind in helping me out and had me sightseeing in about 5 minutes.If you get these binos and the images are doubled please follow this simple step:1)  Put binos between your legs and gently rotate the left tube until it loosens.  Try and sight the binos turning either way until the images align.  If turning the left tube doesn't help tighten it back and then do the same thing with the right side.These are great binos for the price and now that the small problem is fixed I can see around 450-500 yards away.  The sign I was looking at earlier has small print;  I could read it with absolutely no problems.If for any reason you have trouble call the company.  The gentlemen I spoke to was really great and helped me out.  With a lifetime warranty you should at least give them a call before you ship them back.  Glad I made the leap.Mine was focused and ready to use in around five minutes.
3,I am giving this a just okay review because it is a great value for the price but the two lenses came misaligned.  It is out of alignment both horizontally and vertically.  How much more time would it have taken the manufacturer to make sure the two lenses were aligned?  So you have two choices: #1) Send it back and hope the next one you get is properly aligned; or #2) look at the YouTube video about "Celestron Skymaster 15x70 Binocular Alignment" then tear off the right side rubber grip and adjust the tiny screws yourself and void your warranty.  Come on Celestron... you can do better than this.  Align the darn things before you ship them.  Jack the price another $10.00 or $20.00 if you have to in order to cover costs but make sure this is done why don't you?  Also the strap that comes with the binoculars is so thin that it will certainly cut into your neck of you carry the thing around your neck as intended for more then 10 minutes.  Again... jack the price $10.00 if you have to and include a quality strap.  Same goes for the soft sided padded carrying case neck strap.  So... I have this thing... I have to tear it apart... fix the alignment by adjusting the two tiny screws on the right side barrel... buy a new strap for the binoculars... buy a new strap for the carrying case... glue the rubber grip back after alignment and hope it works and still looks halfway decent afterwards.  Granted... once I get these things all fixed I will have a great pair of binoculars but my previous image of Celestron which was stellar has now been tarnished.  Would I buy one again?  Perhaps.  But I now know because of the inherent faults I could never buy another one and give it as a gift.  Just saying.  So... if you don't mind working on the thing if it comes to you misaligned and also buying two new padded neck straps... I would recommend.  If you aren't willing to do this then look elsewhere.
4,Today was my first use of these binoculars along with the tripod I ordered fromÂ   57"TRIPOD FOR SPOTTING SCOPE CAMERA BINOCULARS+CASE !!        I used the free open source stellarium software (google it) to research and locate targets of interest.  Jupiter with four of its moons was the easiest to spot with the binoculars and the most exciting view was the Orion's Nebula. A lot of detail is visible in the sky in general at the minimum maginificaiton. In terms of functionality aesthetics and price this is a great product no complaints. Since this is the only product I have used so far can't really say how it compares with other similar products. The instruction sheet that comes with the product seems a little outdated as the diagram shows a zoom lever whereas in the actual product zoom works through rotation of lens with fingers. I recommend that you get a good sturdy tripod that can remain stable and smooth under the weight of this product the tripod I bought does an OK job but is not the best option by any means.Just like I was if you are having a tough time deciding between a binoculars and a telescope the BBC sky at night magazine episode 11 on YouTube should help you make the decision.Happy stargazing!P.S. Addition on 10/23/2009: The tripod I bought earlier mentioned above in the first line of this review broke yesterday(the lever that spins to adjust the tripod's height just snapped under the weight of the binocular while the height was being adjusted). I got a new oneÂ   Targus Digital TG-6660TR 66-Inch Tripod with 3-Way Panhead        . This new one can take upto 7 lbs weight and is very steady under the binocular's weight highly recommended for use along with the Celestron Skymaster Giant 15x70.
5,I bought a Meade ETX-90EC telescope several years ago so that I would have something lightweight to haul out onto my back deck for quick high-power observations of ISS passing overhead  Jupiter's moons  airplanes way out on the horizon etc.  I now keep the Celestron 15x70's on a tripod near my back door and will probably use them instead most of the time now unless I'm doing some actual stargazing and need to change eyepieces.  The clarity and power that you get with these binoculars is really remarkable for the price as we keep hearing over and over in the reviews.And as we also hear in the reviews for some reason many of these arrive with collimation problems so it was no surprise when I got my first pair and found that it was way way off.  Have you ever seen two Southwest Airlines 737's flying in close formation?  It's quite a sight!  And I never realized that Jupiter is actually a binary planet system!  Seriously it was that bad and my eyes could not pull the two images together no matter how hard I tried.  I found the screws that were mentioned in other reviews and attempted to adjust it but when it's that far off I don't think it's possible.  A few clicks on Amazon and it seems like by the time I signed off on my computer the new pair had already arrived it was that fast.  The new pair is great  collimation is perfect as far as I can tell maybe a real expert would say differently but at this power and price and for what I intend to use it for I am quite happy with them.
4,I am enjoying using these binoculars. Had I not bought a pair of Nikon 7266 binos at the same time I bought these I might have formed a more positive impression of them. As it is I only "mostly like" them instead of "really like" them.Pluses:Wonderful combination of high magnification and a nice big field of view. Could easily see Jupiter and its 4 moons tonight definitely more impressive in stereoscopic vision than with a single eyepiece.Basically good optics with qualifications (see minuses).Excellent for horizontal (terrestrial) viewing.Included tripod mount is needed due to their weight.Minuses:Fit and finish is a bit funky especially compared to the Nikons. Not a deal breaker but noticeable.Noticeable chromatic aberrations in high-contrast areas.Vertical and near-vertical viewing is difficult due to their weight even when mounted on a tripod. Chances are I won't be doing too much lying on the ground to view overhead objects in the sky during the cold months of the year... but that's pretty much what you'd have to do with these.And that is the main catch-22 presented by these binos. The best viewing of any object in the sky is when it is more directly overhead. Yet because of their size and weight these binos aren't much fun when viewing vertical. Tripod or not you still have to get UNDER them to look up and that's clumsy and uncomfortable. They're much better when viewing things nearer to the horizon.So yes I like them and am keeping them but as other reviews have noted with their size and weight comes some disadvantages.
5,These binos are a total crap shoot in terms of arriving with proper focus and in proper collimation. However I happened to luck out here as my 15x70s arrived in crystal clear 100% perfect focus which make them a joy to use for my intended star gazing.  In terms of weight and wobble versus magnification these are an excellent balance in that they can be hand-held (but not for more than 5-10 minutes max) finds your sky target quickly & easily and can be hand-steadied for viewing but you will wish they had more magnification.  However anything more powerful will wobble when hand-held and thus require a tripod and even these 15x70s will work best & for longer duration when mounted onto a sturdy tripod.  Bottom line is that for the price they are an excellent compromise however you must "hold your breath" for its focus issue.  For example after 2 weeks with these 15x70s I ordered a second pair of the higher magnification 25x70 to A-B them against this 15x70s. The 25x70s arrived out of focus and improperly collminated so I returned them.  Altho the 25x70s did bring celestial objects in closer (the full moon filled 50% view area whereas only 25% in my 15x70s) its focus and collmination defect was sufficient enough to cut against its increased magnification.  Had the focus and collmination been 100% crystal clear (like in my 15x70s) I most likely would have kept them despite their extra wobble and need for tripod.  Hey its all physics its a balance test (magnification versus wobble) and you just can't get it all !!  However these 15x70s come very close !!
3,Purchased the binos while on sale. They needed collimating right from the box. I didn't bother with contacting Amazon/Celestron as shipping them back to get them fixed would've added to the total cost of ownership :) Not to mention most likely they got misaligned due to rough handling in transit so most likely the fixed binos would've been knocked out of alignment while returning to me.Anyway 30 minutes later I managed to fix the horizontal miscollimation by turning both screws clockwise 1/4 turn. HUGE quality improvement no more headache and the "circles" merged into one flawlessly.Unfortunately chromatic aberration is present even on-axis. Forums wise men say it is to be expected on this price range. Probably you should go on 2-400$ range not to experience chromatic aberration. The Chinese factory quality control is not that good. Most likely coating is done with diluted regular paint applied with a wirebrush :)Also my biggest pet peeve is the flimsy plastic tripod adapter.The binos will tilt left-right for about 30 seconds if you even touch them slightly. Was aware about that when researching the binos didn't think it was THAT bad. There are web tutorials how to strengthen the adapter with epoxy which I am planning to do in a few days.For whom it may concern this is the tutorial to collimate them: http://www.oberwerk.com/support/collimate.htmBe advised various forums say this collimation only works for the specific interpupillary distance you previously set up. If you pass the binos to a child for exampleSince I've just fixed them I can't say anything about skywatching quality. Yesterday while misaligned Jupiter was so distorted (not to mention the tripod adapter wobling) I couldn't even watch for more than 2 seconds. Moon was pretty though especially watched through one tube only (leave the cover on the other tube so you don't have to squint). Could resolve quite a few craters. Will try again tonight as it should be cloudless and try to update my review.Bottom line is for $49 I paid they are OK and I'll keep them. I wouldn't pay more though.Thanks for reading my lengthy review
4,I bought these as my first pair of astronomical binoculars.  I must say that I am extremely pleased with the purchase.  My pair came properly collimated and delievered sharp crisp views without a hitch.  It really is amazing what you can see with these puppies.  The Galilean moons the Orion Nebula and of course our own Moon looks spectacular as well.  In fact when full its almost blinding to look at it through these.  If you live or have access to a dark sky and the Moon is not up you can even see Andromeda.  Amazing I say!  The build quality is stunning for the price and with Celestron offering a lifetime warranty what do you have to lose.  I think everyone should own a pair.  Even though they are geared towards astronomy they can be used as terrestrial binos.  I sit in my backyard and watch commercial planes fly and can frequently make out the airline!  I highly recommend a tripod to hold these.  They are well balanced lending themselves to short duration hand holding but for longer use you will appreciate them much more with a good tripod.I have had a 8" Newtonian telescope for several years but find myself using it less often than I initially thought I would.  Not because it is a poor product but because it is a job to setup and takedown.  Leveling calibrating aligning... Don't get me wrong telescopes are awesome for what they are able to do but for convienence binoculars take the cake.  Where setting up a telescope might take 30mins to an hour the binoculars are literally grab-n-go.
5,These are a great value.  I was fortunate in that the pair that I received had no collimation issues.  I would suggest if you get a pair which does have collimation issues to return them for another pair rather than "prying up the rubber" and working on them yourself after watching a video.  I also disagree with those who say these are not to be handheld.  These are easily handheld particularly for terrestrial viewing.  For star gazing a tripod and adapter are recommended as the item you are viewing will just jump around too much.  This is not an issue for terrestrial viewing and any person of average size should have no issues hand holding these binoculars.  Even if you are not into astronomy you will find numerous uses for these.  The views they will afford as opposed to 10x50's on far away objects is very impressive.  The fit and finish are also impressive.  These do not feel or look like cheap binoculars.  The one item I would find fault with is the included strap.  It is far too thin to be comfortable for any length of time.  Spend 10 or 20 dollars and upgrade the strap.  I still give the item 5 stars as I feel it represents a tremendous value.  Check them for any collimation issues when you receive them and upgrade the strap.  I would rate these as one of the best values in binoculars you will find.
5,I purchased the Celestron binoculars to round out our options for my wife and I to view the night sky.  We also have four telescopes ranging from a high end 70mm Televue Pronto refractor to 12" Meade Lightbridge Dobsonian.  I also have a pair of Nikon 7X50 mm binoculars that we have used for about 10 years.There are many nights that taking out the new binoculars are my first choice for scans of the night sky due to less than perfect "seeing" conditions.  I have the binoculars mounted on a lightweight camera tripod using the adapter that came with the Celestron 15X70 binoculars and this combo makes for great views of the heavens above or just looking at the many birds that abound around my lakefront home here on the edge of the Ozarks of Missouri. If you do not own a tripod I strongly suggest you invest in one to get the full benefit of these binoculars for steady views. On clear summer nights with low humidity I have great views of the Milky Way.  Binoculars are a great way to view the night skies and see the Andromeda Galaxy star clusters and views of the Pleiades and the Orion Nebula (my personal favorites).I was amazed at the quality of the Celestron binoculars and the views they provide.  The focuser is velvet smooth in operation and the individual focus adjustment for the right eye was easy to adjust.  The eyecups were very comfortable for viewing and fold down easily.  The attached cover for the eyepieces is a very nice design and is easy to attach.  The individual lens caps fit snugly and can be dropped into the binocular bag that came with the binoculars for safekeeping.  The tripod attachment bracket can be affixed to the binoculars with the single bolt by removing the cap on the front of the binoculars just in front of the center focus mechanism.Did I mention I love these binoculars!!!
4,I actually expected these would be a little more powerful based on some reviewer comments about looking at the night sky and moon.  I live on the beach and just wanted to be able to zoom in on boats and islands birds and seals and whatever is going on in the park. It's pretty good but like I say based on some reviews about peering at the moon and the detail visible I thought I'd be able to see Catalina Island which is off of our coast VERY clearly.  In fact... not so much.  I'm no Binocular expert and to be honest... "15x70" didn't really mean anything to me.  I was just going off the reviews and the good price.  So despite the fact they are not as powerful as I expected it's no problem. The optics are ample. They work well and are very affordable.  I also bought the Dolica tripod (glad I did)... don't kid yourself you can't hold it steady without that for all practical purposes.  I also bought the Barska tripod adaptor because some of the reviews said the Dolica adaptor was junk.  Those were older reviews  and maybe the company upgraded the adaptor as in the end I didn't even open the Barska adaptor because the one that came stock on the Dolica tripod has been totally fine no issues at all.  All in all... these binoculars work well and the price is very right.
3,Big heavy and they work decently but the collimation issues make me regret my purchase. These are super sensitive to temperature and I have to recollimate several times at night as the temp drops or I get double vision and have to physically twist them as I hold them to my eyes until the picture comes back to focus or the temp goes back to what they were collimated at. Semi heartbroken over these I guess Ill stop playing around and get a real telescope. Your not going to see galaxies or moons with this one (except ours) so make sure you know what your shopping for if you drop a dime on these.
5,The first pair I bought were 25 X 70 and they had bad collimation. They would give you an instant headache to look through them. I sent them back and ordered the 15 X 70 and this pair is really a great pair of binos! It is a real pleasure to look through the 15X pair and they are a great value for the money. Very good optics much brighter views than with the naked eye very good for surveillance hunting astronomy or anything. I guess the only improvement you could want would be a hard case to protect them from being banged which could ruin the collimation.If you get a pair with bad collimation you can adjust the collimation by lifting the outer corner of the rubber grip on the outside of the prism assembly. By pressing on the rubber you can find the location of the holes before peeling off the rubber. If you can find the small hole there is a slotted adjustment screw which adjusts one axis of the collimation. Only do this to one side as only one side needs to be adjusted. At 90 degrees away is the up and down adjust screw which may also need to be adjusted. Just remember to only turn the screws one turn or less as they are very sensitive.I would not adjust a pair if it is under warranty (like the 25X70 I bought) but if it is a flea market pair you can USUALLY re-align them and make them just like new again! Some of my best binos were bought used for a couple of bucks then adjusted to have perfect collimation.Hope that helps with the frequent double vision issue that these great Celestron binos sometimes have.
4,All the negative reviews bickering over the collimation will go away once they realize that you can adjust it YOURSELF which I had to do. Just locate the two screws under the rubber (see pic on where they are) and very carefully make adjustments while having it mounted on a tripod (actually did mine on a stack of books). So it's an easy fix.Build quality seems good not a fan of the flimsy case and mine didn't come with the wide strap (as shown in listing picture). So dropping one star for now.Will update review as needed.
3,hard to hold steady.  very heavy
5,im mainly a telescope user this is my first pair of binocular's i bought them for star gazing from my back yard first thing i noticed is how nice the construction was they looked like they may even survive a good fall onto pavement its coated in a soft rubber making it easy to hold and not loose grip of The optics were very clean looking no dust or prints left over from the factory it came with a carry bag and a lens cover for each front lens and one for the rear.i tested them out during the day UPS had them at my door at 9:00am i had them ripped open and ready by 9:02am tree's birds my hot neighbor all looked great everything was very bright and most of all razor sharp. Looking at planes in the sky looked like they were right there above your head and all writing on the planes easily seen put them away and waited till what i really bought them for night fall.so not to let this get too long i will list the objects i viewed that are easily seen with these.....Saturn with ring  on very clear night a moon or 2 may be seen as tiny stars.Juipter and 4 moons (no cloud bands its too low in the horizon now)M42M44M45M10M12so far very impressed you may want a tripod these get heavy fast or just simply lay in the grass either way im sure you will be pleased with them like i was the neck strap is kind of abrasive you may want a much softer one around your neck.
5,I wanted to get into amateur astronomy since past long time but was not getting time to do the basic research. I finally dived into it by buying my very first astronomical binoculars the celestron skyquest 15x70. Before buying this product i had read a lot of reviews on Amazon as well as some other places and had also asked questions on astronomy forums.I agree with all the reviews here and absolutely love the binoculars. My first light was the moon coz its easy to spot :). The moon looks absolutely crisp and i was able to see the craters and shadows very clearly. The image of the moon was that sharp that when you imagine the image in 2D you see that the border of the moon is rough coz of craters. The binoculars has an eye relief of 18 mm and that is very helpful when you are wearing glasses. The focal lenght adjustment is very fine which is a huge plus. The binoculars are bit heavy and at this magnification is difficult to hold it steady with your hands. I sit on a stool and place my elbows on my patio grill and that improves it a lot but again not fun without a tripod. I have already ordered a tripod for it and am egarly waiting.Another very good plus point i want to point out is the overall finish of the binocular body is sticky. When i say sticky means you can feel the binoculars sticking in your hands so it will never slip out and drop.The binoculars comes with a carry bag lens covers eyepiece covers and a tripod adaptor.All in all a very good buy good bang for the buck and very clear crisp images... I would recommend this product.
5,I rated these a 5-star even though the first pair came out of the box with a slight collimation problem. (Double images when viewing a single star for example) I initiated a return which Amazon was extremely prompt and shipped out a replacement set. In the two day interim one of my "astro friends" said we could make a simple adjustment to collimate the first pair. He was right. We mounted the faulty binos on a tripod at dusk and quickly reset the collimation using the little set screws on each objective. It was really a very simple fix. I tried to stop the replacement shipment but Amazon was too quick. I returned the 2nd pair. Thanks Amazon!With the first pair now working perfectly I began to enjoy a new level of fun with backyard astronomy. I had built a "couch potato bino chair" (do a google search) and mounted the Skymasters on the chair. You really can't do these justice by hand-holding. I have a pair of Meade 10 x 42mm's for hand-held viewing and the Skymasters blow them away. At a recent star party experienced viewers were impressed. The double cluster in Perseus was just like the popular description; diamonds on black velvet. Beautiful... Very crisp images out to about 85% of the field of view. Just a slight fuzziness at the extreme edges.I've looked through $$$ binos that were absolutely clear that were very nice but at 3-5 times the cost I'll stick with these Skymasters. There is so much info on the web concerning excellent Chinese optics so I guess the SM's are a good example.The only downside was the collimation issue early on. But with Amazon's return policy and great service that initial doubt became a positive.Another plus was that I opened an Amazon credit card which gave me an additional $30 off my purchase. So $55 was my net cost.Incredible value!
4,These represent my first bit of optics for use with star gazing.  So I'm a real beginner in this field.  I have absolutely nothing to compare it to.  Now admittedly I feel a little silly perhaps that my expectations were too high.  I now realize that the photos they use to market this thing are from Hubble or something because you do NOT see anything CLOSE to that looking up at the sky.  A local astronomer writes to the local paper once in awhile and a couple of times he said things like "if you want to gaze at nebula a good pair of binoculars is all you need" and then suggested 10x50 is all you need.  From that I actually expected to look up and see beautiful blue or red shapes in the sky.  Not just... well the same white points I can see with my eyes (only more of them).So yeah I'm a little disappointed.  But not really.  I got a good price on them and they are better for looking out across the valley vs the little 16x10 I was using.  I'm a big guy so the size isn't an issue at all.  But I can see them being very unwieldy for more average sized humans.
5,I ordered these binoculars and got them very quickly. Amazon has fast delivery that's for sure. I've heard some bad reviews on these but mine are great. They're not too heavy or hard to hold if you grip the very ends of the barrels. I just saw the Moon while the Sun was going down and it looked huge compared to my 10x50s. I have to give these 5 stars because the quality is great for the price and the delivery was super fast. It's supposed to be cloudy for several days but it's partly cloudy now so I hope to get a look at Orion and Jupiter's Moons this evening before the bad weather sets in.If you want a pair of binoculars that you can read small signs nearly a mile away with or get amazing views of the Moon and its craters they're very well worth the $70.00 you'll spend. The optics are not as good as binoculars 5 times the price and there's apparently a chance that you could get a bad pair but for the price I paid I'm very satisfied and look forward to scanning the night sky with these monsters. I can't wait for clear weather or the next comet...or my next fishing trip so I can see what others are catching from a mile away!
4,I wanted to get my feet wet with Astronomy and decided to get Binoculars first since I live in the city so there's little sense in buying a big telescope.The first set of binoculars I got was Orion 7x50 Scenix. For about 100 bucks they were great. Crystal clear and everything. But in the back of my mind I kept wondering what if I had more magnification and a little more objective...so I bought these.If I had never bought the Orions I would have given the Skymasters 5 stars. Lifetime no-fault warranty. Big objective lenses. 15x magnification. Light. Tripod adapter. These would have totally made me happy. However because I got the Orions I'm able to make a comparison and yeah the build quality of the Skymasters is a little wanting. The eyepieces move when you fold the eye cups down. There's a very slight optical imperfections with some objects that show up as sharp pinpoints with the Orions.Not bad mind you. The price they can't be beat. With these on a really small cheap tripod I'm able to see Titan. Just barely but it's totally there. Can't see Saturns rings but I can tell there's something odd with its shape more than with the 7x Scenix.So yeah thumbs up. For the price I doubt they can be beat. But not the end-all binoculars for stargazing. Also You'll want a tripod for these.
5,I decided to finally write a praising review for these because I've been out for four nights running showing 20 neighbors the comet PANSTARRS 2012/etc in these and everyone else is impressed too including guys who have hunted for many years and have strong opinions about optics.Really cool stuff you can see with these:Open clusters like The Pleiades"Star nursery" nebulas like The Orion NebulaGalaxies like Andromeda Triangulum and othersGlobular clustersdouble starsthe color of starsThe bigger moons of Jupiter and Saturn. (though it's not quite enough magnification to see rings--looks more like Saturn has ears than rings in these)comets like Holmes and PANSTARRS and the upcoming (as I write) ISONI have an 8-inch dob telescope too but the longer I sky-gaze the more I use these because there's not set-up required at all. Grab them plant myself in my lounge chair with a beverage and I'm happy for 90 minutes out there. Even with perfect transparency darkness and a filter I can't see the Veil nebula in my scope but can with these binocs (though to be sure it's a dim and subtle thing).I'm a middle-aged woman and I can use them without tripod--either brace elbows into my waist for short viewing sessions or for longer sessions wrap my wrists with strips of cotton material (I use my old boxing hand wraps for this but any old sheet torn into strips will do).At highest price they are incredibly inexpensive for the value; on sale you'd be a nut to pass them by!
5,I bought a pair of the SkyMasters for stargazing use based on the relatively low price and the volume of positive reviews here. I have been extremely happy with this purchase. As a novice in stargazing I wanted a pair of binoculars that were not too expensive but would work well for celestial observation and keep me engaged. These goggles are really amazing.  We just used it on a camping trip with no ambient light pollution and I could make out the outline of the rings of saturn comet-like star clusters and tons of double stars. And just pointing these suckers up anywhere in the sky brought brought so many stars into the field of vision that it looked like hundreds of grains of sugar spilled across the background. In light-polluted Southern California these binocs bring out amazing detail of the moon's peaks and craters as well as stars invisible to the naked eye....Now the caveat: If serious about stargazing with these binoculars you will absolutely need a very sturdy tripod as well as a heavier adapter than the plastic one included. I recommend the Ravelli APGL Professional tripod. I originally purchased the Vista 60'' lightweight tripod Amazon suggested as an accompanying purchase with these bincoculars but that tripod was a joke in trying to support a large binocular such as the Sky Masters. The Ravelli gets the job done however. I also upgraded to an aluminum adapter which helped. It's a bit of a challenge to eliminate all shaking but this tripod-aluminum adapter set up has made using these binoculars a real pleasure and got a lot of oohs and ahs from fellow campers who had a look through them.
3,With all the good press about Celestron SkyMaster Giant 15x70 Binoculars somebody's got to get a bad set and that was me this time.  I thought I had done my homework:  Poro BAK4 Angular Field of View: 4.4Â° Linear Field of View (@1000 yds): 230.41 ft (70.23 m) Exit Pupil: 4.7 mm (0.19 in) Eye Relief: 18 mm (0.71 in) and seemly great reviews. Therefore I will just deduct 2 stars rather than 4.Mine were most definitely 1 star material though.  The recent discounted price of $49.99 shipped made be decide to finally own a pair.  Unfortunately for me mine arrived with a severe collimation problem.  My first light was a look at Jupiter and no matter what I did I would see 2 Jupiters??  Took them out the next day and looked at the electric meter on a house down the street and 2 electric meters; my brain tried its best to compensate but was just giving me severe eye strain.  I got out my Fujinon 7x42 roof prism binoculars (which cost about 5x more) and everything looked perfect and super sharp in them.  I then did the Google thing on binocular collimationMis-collimation is quite common. I found the Celestron 15x70 Skymaster is the same Chinese-manufactured binocular sold under the Bear Barska Galileo and Oberwerk brands.  If one searchs "binocular collimation" there are instructions all over the 'net on how to adjust the binoculars yourself but I find it unexceptable QC on Celestron's part to deliver them this way.  Also the adjustment process entails removing some of the rubber molding and is very experimental hit or miss in many cases.  Not something I was willing or desired to do.I hope that isn't why this batch was marked down.  I encourage everyone to try theirs out and make sure you have a good set.  The Amazon return process would not let me exchange....simply a refund.  Amazon makes returns very easy by the way with a paid UPS label printed right so the return is very easy.
5,Sure there are better units out there but for the price (typically under $100) these are hard to beat for value. The images are sufficiently crisp over most of the viewing area. Mine were collimated and have not needed adjustment over the last year of *careful* adult use. The focusing action is ok and the adjustment/travel is far enough to accomodate my worse-than-average nearsightedness if I want to use them without glasses. However they can also be used fairly well with glasses on too. The weight can be an issue for some people - while not particularly heavy they aren't particularly light either. That plus the magnification are at what I think for me at least is the limit of hand-held usefulness. I have some 15x 100mm Zhumells that pretty much require a tripod. These you can get by without a tripod but of course images are steadier with one or other bracing. Note of course that these units are not sealed and not waterproof so internal condensation with temp/humidity changes from going inside<->outside might be a problem over time. I opted to pick up a sealed waterproof hardcase to keep them in with silica gel packets thrown in to be sure. That does up the overall cost of ownership since the case was nearly as much as the binoculars but it's still half or less than better inert-gas-filled units. For the best in performance look to spend more for budget-conscious this is a respectable choice.
5,I've been looking for a while for some good long range optics for some Audubon volunteer work I am doing. I thought of getting a spotting scope as many birders use spotting scopes. The thought of looking through one eye for extended periods of time was a drawback. I read a lot of the reviews on these binoculars before I went ahead and purchased them. They arrived in the mail about 2 days after they were shipped. Opening the box I was immediately impressed with the quality. Rugged with quality construction. In some of the reviews reviewers trashed the quality of the included case. It serves it's purpose. These are a bargain without any case. I found the optics clear and crisp and was impressed with their ability to pull in far away objects. Another piece of included equipment the tripod adaptor has also been unfavorably reviewed. I mounted the binoculars on my Manfroto tripod that I use for all my photography work. While the binoculars are not rock solid on the tripod they are easily steadied and the adaptor that comes with the binoculars works well enough that I am not considering buying an after market one. I find that I can hand hold them for short periods of time. You can almost always find something around to steady them in the field tree fence post whatever. Just lean against whatever you're using for support to steady them. I haven't tried them for star gazing yet but will do that when I can get away from ambient light. For anyone considering buying these I would say go ahead they are well worth the price.
4,I was reluctant to take a chance on these binoculars because of all of the reviews here on Amazon regarding the collimation issues that people have encountered but mine came out of the box perfectly collimated.  We've had frigid weather and cloudy skies every day since getting them but last night we had a temporary reprieve so I took them out for a test ride.  I found a dim hesitant star in the sky that can only be described as looking like a tiny spec of dust.  When I held the binoculars up to the star it seemed to come to life but what was even more amazing was the discovery of all of the stars that surrounded it that were imperceptible to the naked eye.  The heavens are full of stars and you can see quite a few of them with these binoculars - even in light polluted suburban areas like the one I live in. I also pointed the binoculars at the full moon and the light that they captured from it was too bright for my eyes so I had to pull away.  I look forward to mounting them on a tripod for steadier views.  I would say these were worth the 54 dollars I paid for them.  Enjoy the constellations!
5,My 7 year old has taken a great interest in space which led me to these binoculars. I have very limited experience with star gazing and telescopes. My time with telescopes years ago did not excite me. I would spy a little dot through a narrow field of view and be rather unimpressed. I wanted something that would be very simple to use even for my 7 year old. Keep in mind I have nothing to compare these to. According to a light pollution map I checked the corridor between DC and NY which I live directly in the middle of is the worst place in the world for star gazing. I tried these out last night picking a random spot in the sky where there were about 12  visible stars. What I saw was a wide field of view containing thousands of points of light. I was amazed. I turned it on the moon and the light was a shock on my eyes at first. After adjusting the focus I could make out details on the moon I had never seen with cheap telescopes. The difference vs the naked eye is like comparing a 13" tube TV to a 60" 3D HDTV. I am sure there are much better options for much more money but for the price I was blown away and I suspect my young son will be too. Also you can use these without a tripod if you can keep a very steady hand but I recommend having one on hand.
4,These binoculars have worked well for my astronomical observations.  We saw the recent comet through them.  They gather a lot of light.  They are heavy.  It is difficult to hold them to your eyes for any length of time.  If you are going to use them for astronomy I strongly recommend you get a tripod for them.  It is difficult to hold them steady enough.The quality of the glass was surprisingly good.  Views are sharp and clear.
5,I've had this Sky Master 15x70 Binoculars from Celestron for about a month now since I've decided to pursue my fascination with astronomy. Before I started actually doing any backyard/amateur astronomy I have been listening to podcast i.e. astronomy cast and reading the book night watch by Terence Dickinson and they advice the use of binoculars for beginners. Although they advice to start with a 7x50 or 10x50 binoculars since it'll be eaier to handle and not much shaking I took my chance and baught this binoculars and I have no regrets. I would advice the use of a tripod for this binoculars though I have been out at night just gazing the stars and planets whenever I have a chance since I got this binocular. I've seen faint stars that you wouldn't see with just your eye specially I'm here in the city planets would appear much like a really bright star with this binocular the past few weeks Venus Mars and Saturn are close to the constellation leo where I have been observing you wont see saturns ring from this bad boy but you'll be able to tell it's saturn. This is a MUST for beginners in astronomy I'm exhausting as much as I can from this till I'm ready to buy my first telescope to go another level in amateur astronomy. Anyway I'm learning a lot from this binocular and I'm glad I baught it and hey I can even use it when I go to the ballpark or when me and my son are at the zoo.P.S. I've seen so many satellites whozzing by the sky while observing the not so dark sky.Cheers!
5,I was finally able to use these binoculars after a few days of rain and clouds that had crowded the sky. I love airplanes and I live about 50 miles north of Atlanta international airport so I see a decent amount of traffic everyday. These 15x70 Binoculars hit the spot and just today I could make out a Delta Airlines Boeing 767 very clearly and it was at about 20000 feet. My 10Ã40 Binoculars could not do the trick so I decided to upgrade to the 15Ã70 Binoculars. These are great for lower altitude airplanes like with 25000 feet or below because once you get up into the 30 to 40000 feet the range on these is NOT strong enough. Which is okay with me because a lot of the planes are much lower where I live. If you are interested in buying this type of Binoculars they are a great pick! Before you buy Binoculars for the purpose of airplane spotting do yourself a favor and download the Flight aware app. Its free and tells you how high the planes are around you! If they are above 30000 than buy the 25Ã70 binoculars. Also the Image shake is not that bad and they are not heavy at all! Hope this helps and Aviation enthusiasts who are reading this!...
5,These binoculars were better than I would have guessed even after reading a number of the reviews here.On my first clear night without a moon (and also my first time using binoculars for astronomy) I had no problem finding the four Galilean moons around Jupiter.  The Orion Nebula wasn't as clear as I'd hoped but does show up brightly.For quick background:  I live in an area with enough light pollution that I can't make out the next arm in the Milky Way at all with just the naked eye.  With these binoculars I can make out a lot of indistinct dots which shows me what other people see in darker areas.My pair did not have the problems mentioned by others of objects showing up as doubles.  Hopefully that will continue to be true after a few years of normal use.They are heavy but I was able to view for a good while without a tripod.  Yes the image bounces around but I'm used to that.  I'll connect it to my Manfrotto 055XPROB the next time I go out -- great way to multipurpose my camera equipment!These binoculars are cheaper than even the junky telescopes and yet I had a much better experience using them than any telescope that didn't cost at least 8 times as much.  Before you blow a bunch of money on a scope buy a pair of these and see if you're into astronomy enough to justify the cost of a much larger investment.
5,I was looking for a pair of astronomical binoculars that were going to do the folling for me.  I wanted to be able to quickly located and see the actual nebulae clusters and other faint objects that are really hard to locate with a larger telescope unless you want to pay a big bundle for one that auto-locates.  Everyone talks about either the optics suck or they are great or this problem or that.  I knew I wasn't buying a pair of image stabalized binoculars with incredibly expensive ground glass and coatings.  They may produce a better image but it is just as faint and certainly the same size assuming you have the same magnification.  Besides that you are not using binoculars for photography but to just see with you own eyes what you read about.  These binculars do focus well the optics are absolutely fine.  The first clear night I looked a bit below Orion's belt (difficult in the summer in the northern hemsphere) and within 30 - 40 seconds I was looking at the nebula I had only wanted to see before wow!  I used my camera tripod (heavy duty) and the adopter so I could locate the great nebule in Andromeda very cool.  The bottom line is if you want something for astronomy that is easy well made and delivers huge bang for the buck buy a pair of these Celestron SkyMasters.
5,Overall good bright 15x viewing in day and night. 15x viewing allows you to see additional terrain features of the moon but don't expect them to be "real close up". 15x maybe better for plane spotting and boat watching.Works best with a sturdy tripod that features manoeuvrable lever handles left-right and up-down. Can be handheld for short burts of time but once fatigue sets in it will be hard to hold a steady image. Especially when celestial viewing and you need to achieve a high overhead angle. Makes me giddy if I overdo trying to get an image. Otherwise no issues with getting the binos in focus out of box.The small tripod stand binos come with is plastic and a little filmy. However it does its job. What I do is to mount the small plastic tripod stand on the tripod proper and then screw the binos on to the small plastic tripod stand. Recommend to have The neck strap on while doing this.The neck strap and case that comes with the binos is of low quality but again it does its job. I replaced the neck strap with a quality DSLR camera neck strap. I would wish to get a better case if I am traveling with the binos.
4,I didnt give it 5 stars just because they are not $600 pair but just as good for new inexperienced people. It did need calibration because each time I looked up at the stars and took my eyes off I would see double image. But a simple calibration fix and it works amazing.To calibrate there are small flat head screws under the covers on each side one is blank and other has Celestron on it. Those things are not covers that can NOT be removed. One of the screws on the right side under Celestron is located under the rubber grip across the 7 on the 15x70 indication (right across where the rubber starts pull it back slowly). its right under the cover move it slowly and carefully with a small flat head screwdriver just push it back. Once you find it there is another for the left side same place just different side.The direction that you turn the screw is the direction that that side of the binocular will go.  On the right side turn the screw clockwise moving the image down and to the left.  Turn it counter clockwise to move the image up and right.  The same for the left side.  Clockwise = down and left.  Counter Clockwise = image moved up and right.
5,These binoculars are amazing. I live in one of the most light polluted areas in the world (close to NYC). On a good night I can only see maybe a dozen stars by eye when I look at those stars those I'm amazed at the hundreds of other stars that your eye alone can't see. The details on the moon are incredible and can be focused to a crisp picture.These binoculars can also be used for bird watching during the day. It's pretty cool looking at a bird 1/4 of a mile away and being able to see the wind ruffle its feathers.The included mount is very helpful when combined with a quality tripod allowing you to show others specific things in the night sky or to even just help steady yourself.
5,The binoculars are great. You only observe a slight chromatism when looking at the high contrast objects (moon birds on bright background). Very good value for spent money. I didn't have a collimation issue when they arrived.
5,I have been looking at this for a long time and decided to give it a try based on all the reviews.  The item came well packed and the shipping was very quick. I was quite surprised at the quality of the scope specially considering the low price. It seems to be well made and the optics are fantastic. I was somewhat worried about alignment since some buyers had to return or had to collimate  due to misalignment but I was fortunate that the alignment was perfect. It comes with a tripod adaptor but it was not sturdy enough to hold this large binocular. It works fine if you use a heavy duty tripod on solid ground but even the slightest touch it will shake. I re-enforced it by filling the sides of the adaptor with hard epoxy. I used it on a clear night and was able to see Mars Jupiter and Saturn.  I could clearly see the four moons of Jupiter saw Saturn like a disc but could not see the rings my eyes are not that great now.  The dust caps are not that great again for the price cannot complain. Overall I am very happy with this Binocular I think for the price it is one of the best deals out there.
2,I've bought two of these Celestron Skymaster 15x70 binocs.  Both had the double vision problem.  They were seeing double images and needed adjustment of the colimation.  You can adjust for mild misalignment by just changing the IPO like it says in their guide book.  But mine were too far out of alignment for that to work.  So there are two screws on each side of the lenses underneath the rubber handgrip. (see picture) One adjusts horizontal and one vertical alignment.  The horizontal screws are under the rubber handgrip where you can get at them just by lifting up the rubber grip with your fingernail and looking under there.  On the right side lense the screw is just above the "0" in "15x70" printed on the lense.  So you can turn those tiny screws a little bit with a jewelers slotted screw driver to get the horizontal lined up.  Just look at a star or something and by shutting one eye at a time figure out which way you need to move the double image until they line up horizontally.  If the vertical is also off then the double image shows two star images one above the other.  In the picture there is a screw driver inserted into the vertical screw. To get at the vertical screw you can insert a small screw driver under the corner of the rubber hand grip and expose the screw.  I just pulled the whole rubber grip off mine to find the screws but they are both accessible if you carefully pull the rubber back from where they are located.  Turn the vertical screw half a turn and then look at the star again and see if the image is better.  I only had to make adjustments on one side of the lenses to get the images to merge.  Used them for a while and readjusted to reduce eye strain. Once I'm sure the image is not straining my eyes I'll glue the rubber grip back on.  Obviously doing this all yourself may void the warranty.  But who cares?  They only cost $60.
5,Excelentes binoculares! Un tanto pesados por lo que recomiendo comprar un trÃ­pode para usarlos. Vienen en muy buenas condiciones y son perfectos para observar tanto la naturaleza como objetos en el cielo nocturno. La mejor compra que he hecho en mi vida! Con esta descripciÃ³n van algunas fotos de los objetos que he observado.PD: Las fotos de estrellas son con algunos segundos de exposiciÃ³n (plÃ©yades y nebulosa de OriÃ³n)
5,I've had these for about 2 weeks. The set I have came undamaged in perfect working condition. The optic barrels seem to be aligned very well. They seem to be ruggedly made. The lens coatings are multi coated but I doubt it is a broad spectrum coating that you find on high end binoculars. But keep in mind these are not high priced high end binoculars.Overall they give you a nice wide view with good brightness......precise fine adjustments are possible.You would notice a difference in image quality if you compare these to a 300 dollar binocular.But I find these are pretty good and well worth the price that Amazon is asking. Especially with Free shipping its a very good bargain.One reviewer mentioned holding these with one hand on the front of one barrel. Which helps to stabilize the 15x magnification.These are best used on a tripod. When mounted on a tripod you can get very good stable viewing. For short periods like for bird watching you can view these by hand.For celestial viewing the tripod is mandatory with the exception of moon viewing.The tripod adapter that comes with the unit is useable but some people will want to purchase a all metal adapter.I would recommend these for anyone who just wants some high power binoculars without spending hundreds of dollars.Even if you only use these for casual all purpose use you really cant go wrong on these. And you wont feel like you've spent a whopping amount of money for something you may not use that often.As usual Amazon is top notch to buy from.
5,These Are pretty cool! They work well and don't have any significant flaws or problems. They will do as advertised and much more. You can use them for terrestrial and bird watching purposes with great ease. These are very good and definitely worth the money to buy. The included tripod mount is plastic and is a little shaky but overall you get amazing quality. 9/10 would recommend. It's also worth knowing a thing or two about how they work and how to use them properly and effectively. I wouldn't recommend these to a young child for they are quite heavy after a while as well for an adult to an extent. I would also recommend getting a steady tripod for better results at observational use. Great for visual Astronomy.
5,If you have a steady rest and are not packing them around these are awesome binocs for the price.I have owned these for several years now. I use them for hunting in Montana. Big wide open spaces. I use a more expensive set of good binocs for most of my glassing but when you really want to reach out a long way to bring out more detail these work great. They are just to big and heavy to pack along for hikes but for spot and stalk from the pickup perfect. Example: on the evening before elk season started I spotted some elk three miles away while glassing from the truck using my regular binocs. Then with the Celestron I could tell there was one bull in the group. The next morning at dawn again from 3 miles away in low light conditions the Celestron allowed me to find the el in the same spot and I could tell there was a mature bull among them.This year they were along for hunting antelope. We could find antelope with regular binocs then use these big babies for ascertaining whether they were bucks or not. Perfect for that.
5,Wow exactly what I was looking for. My property backs up to BLM / mountains also is a mile up from the city - so views on both  sides not to mention the sky. Of course I was confused on power of binoculars that I needed. After reading feedback I decided on the 15X70 because of the field of view. I was buying these more for land than for space.  These are outstanding. The focus is very forgiving with just small adjustments I can read signs in the city - and pretty much determine the make of the vehicle miles up the mountain.The details of the moon are incredible although I prefer not to use them on viewing the spacestation just turns it into a bright light. Looking forward to enjoying these for years to come.Anyway - very happy I have these - excellent binoculars!!Update: Now I have had these for over 6 months and still very happy with the performance. Just used these to view an off-road race.. they were Super!  Wow looking at some of these reviews is just scary. Myself I would definitely buy another pair if I needed to with zero hesitation. They are a great value for what you are getting.
2,After reading several reviews I was hoping not to have the same problem that so many others have had with these binos. Sure enough they arrived not aligned or culminated - I am not sure of the correct term that applies here. You see double through them. What the left eye sees and what the right eye sees appears about an inch apart. So unless you close an eye and use it pirate scope style (saying arrrgh at the same time is optional) These binos are useless unless you adjust them. To do that you are going to have to rip up a portion of their rubber grips. I am pretty sure that if I did this I could glue it back on when I was done. But it would very likely void any warrantee in the process. I also purchased the Fair Trade 4 year protection at the time of purchase which I just sent a refund request in for since there is no way to keep these without voiding the warrantee.There are youtube videos out that walk you through adjusting the double vision yourself and also more than a few that advise against it if you want professional results.And so why a two star rating and not a one star rating? Because these binos feel substantially good in the hand. There is also too much purple fringing going on so the images are not going to be super great but at that magnification and at that price it's a pretty marvelous toy and that ain't bad.They are heavy and longish. I can hold them steady enough to see buildings on the horizon I never knew were there before. And I can see planes on a runway I didnât know I could see before. But trying to follow a moving object in the sky or focus in any kind of a steady way over time forget it. I do have a tripod and I did spend the extra for a good mount.Although I am really wondering about just sending them in and saving a bit to get some binos that don't have the purple fringing and don't come with double vision. Good enough at $50 if you accept no warrantee and if your are handy you can make them work. Close enough to good enough and yet and yet .. your mileage may vary.
4,Excellent price! Solidly built good but not great optics.This is what you can usually expect with chinese optics but atthese prices they are an incredible bargain. I've heard qualitycan vary on these from pair to pair but all the ones I've looked through under numerous names have been very nice. Mine were fine right out of the box no collimation issues damage etc. Images on center axis are very sharp with distortion creeping in around the outer 10% or so of the FOV. Hey Fujinons these ain't but they're still pretty damned nice with very good contrast nice sharp focus and bright green multicoating on the objectives. One problem for me with these is blackout. They almost have too much eye relief for me as it is very difficult to position my eyes in just the right spot. Also if you plan to use these for an extented period you will need a tripod. These are heavy and about the limit for handheld use without getting jittery. Open star clusters and scanning the Milky Way are where these binos really shine. At under 60 bucks you just can't beat 'em. Every amateur astronomer needs a pair of these to knock around with.
5,Do yourself a big favor and add a Opteka OPT7000 74-inch Professional Tripod to go with this excellent set of binoculars.  These binoculars come with a tripod adapter for attaching it to almost any camera tripod (I bought a Celestron 93524 Binocular Tripod Adapter for it which is a bit taller than what comes with these binoculars...but the adapter that comes with these binoculars is just fine).  The Opteka OPT7000 74-inch Professional Tripod is tall 74 inches tall and is of excellent quality for the fairly low price charged for it.  It has a height adjustor that brings the binoculars' eyepieces to the perfect eye-height to adjust for most upward-viewing angles.  Without a tripod keeping the moon or stars from dancing across the viewable image of these binoculars is a challenge.  With a tripod the image stays rock-solid.  (Tip: Attach the binoculars onto the tripod backwards so that the adjustment handle of the Opteka OPT7000 74-inch Professional Tripod is on the downrange-side so that the adjustment handle doesn't get in the way of the viewing-side of the binoculars...it is still easy to use the adjustment handle from on the downrange-side if not easier especially for those who are right-handed).
5,I've used several pairs of binocs for amateur astronomy for two decades and I've learned what works well.  Bottom line is these Celestrons are a *steal* for the aperture size and price point.  Overall the quality of the image is high - accurate collimation minimal coma on the periphery no chromatic aberration.  Adjustments for inter pupillary distance focus and diopter are smooth.  For larger aperture this instrument not heavy;  I bought a monopod mount with grip release but never have any need for it (you will need a mount if you try to split binaries and observe Jupiter's moons but for finding more diffuse deep sky objects I have no problem holding these steady without a mount).  Moving up from 10x50s the FOV is smaller but you will be astounded by the increase in object brightness and magnification.  There are some targets I cannot find in 10x50s but which can be detected with these 15x70s.  These Celestrons are replacing my 10x50s as my "grab and go" instrument.  For $60 I took a chance and was nicely rewarded!
3,I paid $65...I noticed that a week later they were $95...had I paid $95 I'd be a lot more disappointed. The viewers are not very comfortable...I tend to see my eyelashes more than the stars. I haven't used it on a tripod but the adapter seems a bit cheap but really can't comment on how well it will work since it depends on the quality of your tripod.The images are okay...nothing to write home about but it's not that powerful of a binocular. I've had Zuhmell 20x80 in the past and judging against those these are not close..I am returning them and buying another Zuhmell...Bottom line they're not bad just a bit disappointing...also I had a hard time adjusting the viewing to see just one center image...but perhaps they might just be the wrong size for me.Overall it's a wide view and you can definitely see many stars you can't see with your naked eyes but I would opt for the more powerful set if you are an avid night watcher.
3,I'd bought a previous pair of lesser strength Celestron's and they worked as advertised. This pair for some reason won't focus both eyes. Each side magnifies but i can't get them to work together.
4,Great for astronomy. Especially the Pleiades. Saw Andromeda galaxy and companions at a dark site last night. Andromeda is large but you can see the whole thing in these. Kind of big for most people and shaky at 15x but the view beats my good 7x35s.The Ring Nebula and Saturns Rings require more power. Seems like most Messier objects are visible in these and much easier to locate in these. Think you'd have to spend a lot to get better optics. Good resolution and contrast.MUCH easier to find stuff in these than a telescope!!! Wide field of view and you dont have to have a tripod!!! Have you ever tried to find something at 150x? Aint easy. Part of the problem is my mount however others struggle too. I can find most Messier in these. Think I got m78 last night!Seems like I see more in these than my 5". It might need some work not sure. But these seem to be higher optical quality and have larger exit pupil.Remember you cant see colors through amateur telescopes. In daylight you can but nebulae are dim. Mostly you see fuzzy patches. Binoculars are much easier to start out with in astronomy.
5,First pair of astronomy binoculars I have owned and the views were way better than I expected.  Great for open clusters double clusters and really big nebula. Could not view the Andromeda Galaxy because it is not in season but I know it would look great because you can see Andromeda without any optical aides. (visible with the naked eye)  Viewing in the Southern sky in the constellation Sagittarius and Scorpius was simply amazing.  Actually viewed the Lagoon nebula and Trifid nebula in Sagittarius in the same field of view now that was bad ass.  The only thing is that the 15x70's are border line for needing a tripod.  The high magnification makes them hard to hold steady.  I did figure out that if you hold them at the very end of the body (the long cone looking tubes opposite of where you put your eyes)  you can hold them a lot more steady cause it kinda balances out the weight.  I would recommend these binoculars to anyone interested in astronomy and also for veteran night sky enthusiast.  I work 3rds and do not get to take my scope (10" Dobsonian) out very much except on weekends and the binoculars allow me to get some quick views without having to setup my scope.  Just an easier way to get my fix lol
4,I RECEIVED THE 15X70'S AND RIGHT AWAY NOTICED THEY FELT VERY LIGHT( PLASTIC BODY?) COMPARED TO MY OLDER 11X80 UNITRON BINOS. ANYWAY AFTER TAKING THEM OUT SIDE TO TEST THE OPTICS I NOTICED SHADOWS OF DIRT/DUST SPECKS IN THE IMAGES. BACK INSIDE specks of dust inside the LENS BOTH EYEPIECES and even a hair behind  one objective .THERE IS EVEN SOME SMALL SMUDGE MARKS ON THE INSIDE OF THE OBJECTIVES.  ALSO THE PLASTIC TRIPOD ADAPTER  that comes with binos TO MOUNT THE BINOS ON A TRIPOD IS USELESS. IT VIBRATES LIKE IT WAS MADE OF RUBBER AT THE SLIGHTEST TOUCH. PURCHASERS SHOULD BUY A METAL ADAPTER.  I HAVE BOUGHT MANY CELESTRON PRODUCTS IN THE PAST AND USED TO BE HAPPY WITH THE QUALITY... NOT SO SURE NOW.  I CAN'T BELIEVE CELESTRON QUALITY CONTROL HAS LET SOMETHING LIKE THESE PASS.  ANYWAY IN ALL FAIRNESS THEY WERE ONLY $50.00 AND HAVE FAIRLY SHARP BRIGHT WIDE FIELDS OF VIEW. IF YOU CAN LOOK OVER THE  internal dust  debris..UPDATE 4-2013.... After using these a long time.. I conclude that they are a great pair of Binos even though they seem to be made cheaper these days.Hardy notice the internal dust and hair now... Optics are good  especially for the price and they have a WIDE bright FOV .
1,After reading a lot of reviews I decided to purchase the Celestron SkyMaster Giant 15x70 binoculars instead of a telescope. The price was right and they had a lot of positive feedback. Unfortunately neither the first pair or the second replacement pair worked.The First Pair:The first pair came in the mail on time. The amazon tape was ripped on one end leaving the box open on that side. Inside I found air puffs and another box. In that box I found the Celestron box which had the Celestron bag in it with the binoculars. All the parts were there but the tripod mount was broken so I was unable to attach it to the very nice AmazonBasics 60 inch tripod that I had also received that day. The binoculars were very fuzzy to look through that night like the lenses weren't seeing together. After reading several reviews saying this was an easy fix all I needed to do was tighten two screws I tried it. I don't recommend doing this! The screws are very tiny and hard to find hidden under the glued down hand grips. I tightend the loose screw like reviews had said to do but it did not help. My mom who is an avid bird watcher looked through them and told me to take them to a local Jax where they have a binocular and telescope section. There they told me that the lenses in the binoculars were so messed up and that I should just return them. After their advice I requested that a replacement pair be sent.The Second Pair:This pair also came on time. The box was not damaged which I was very happy to see. Inside the outer box was just the Celestron box and some air puffs not another box like the first pair. Inside the binoculars were packaged like they would be at a store making me assume that the 1st pair must have been a return pair as their was not in protective styrofoam like this pair. But as soon as I took them out I could hear something rolling around inside the binoculars. When I looked though them I could see out the left side but the right side was completely black. Disappointed I decided not to hassle with them. At this point I just want my money refunded.Hopefully I'll be able to find what I am looking for.
5,I really like these binoculars.  My first pair and I didn't imagine the image would be so crisp.  They are not terribly heavy but I'm sure for stargazing will need the tripod.  I was able to be somewhat stable to check out moon and it's definitely high detail.  Never seen moon like that before!  I watch surfers off in the distance and it's pretty cool to see them catch waves.  I can also check the mountains a few miles away and get to watch a water fall. This is the original reason I got these was to see the waterfall that I could barely see was there before.  Now I have all kinds of Hawaii right in my eyes from my home.
5,You can look the stars the moon and others thing. It look really good theyâre delicate but worth the price.
5,I bought a pair of SkyMaster binoculars about a year ago. With these the universe of the night sky was opened up to me. I learned the constellations and observed clusters nebula galaxies the planets and the moon (of course). They are also wonderful for nature observing although are too heavy to carry on person when hiking without a pack. Don't waste money on a tripod. Unless you are willing to purchase a binocular telescope stand it is best to just use the SkyMasters for scanning objects and not focusing too long on one particular target. I have since bought a 5 inch refractor telescope which is now my primary nighttime viewing instrument. However the Skymaster binoculars are what got me into the astronomy in the first place and also what caused me to catch the bug known as aperture fever. Additionally although these are wonderful binoculars for scanning the night sky they are again too heavy for children and even some adults to comfortably hold for a long period of time. Therefore if comfort is key to the decision to buy an astronomy instrument (meaning the need for a mount/heavy tripod) get a reflector or refractor telescope instead. Orion Telescopes (via Amazon) sells good entry level scopes for around 300 to 500 dollars. This includes a mount and two eyepieces. With my own telescope purchase I chose something a bit more substantial but probably would have been fairly happy with an entry level scope as well.
2,****FIRST IMPRESSIONS****I just got this item today. Previously I had to return Barska 20x80 (bad collimation could not focus the right scope somewhat blurry and dim images) and Oberwerk 20x80 LW (was not collimated properly and right lens broke off during cleaning with cloth I don't think it was properly glued otherwise the optics were good sharp bright). These binoculars are the whole different story. They are crisp bright great magnification (not big difference from 20x). Easy to focus view is not too shaky (of course lifting 40 lb every day helps....:). I haven't tried them at night yet. However I think they are slightly off in terms of collimation but I have to double check on this one. Nothing bothers me when I look through them but the right image is a little bit lower when I look at the eyepieces from a distance.****UPDTE #1****So far so good. I am pleased with daylight views as they appear sharp and pretty bright. Pushing eyebrows against eyepieces does not break the focus of the right scope. At night I was able to observe the full Moon which appeared really bright and crisp with lots of details. Also I was enjoying looking at Jupiter and 4 of it's moons. The planet appeared as a small disk of yellowish color. I think I was able to see one of the cloud belts of darker orange color when I moved my eyes farther from eyepieces. However I observed some spiked lights on the right upper side and the edges were not sharp. I suspect that some discollimation might be a problem (I am getting my tripod today and will try to fix this problem). I saw Andromeda (large oval fuzz ball). It was clearly visible even with the full Moon not far from it. Can't wait to see it in the dark skies. Overall these binos show good performance in the light polluted skies (city lights + full Moon). I will update again after going to a pitch black spot during new Moon nights.****** 2016 *********UPDATE********Well I had it for about 4 years and these binos started to give up. All rubber eyepieces fell apart and broke off completely. Rubber cover on a central nob cracked badly and will fell off soon. Large lenses developed weird blemishes and fogging INSIDE and there is no way to clean it. I think I will get a different brand. I expected these binoculars to last a bit longer and I don't want to buy a new pair every 4 years.
3,These are top notch beginner star gazing Binoculars. The moon looked brilliant. I live in a city with a lot of light pollution but when you point the binoculars in what would be an empty area as seen with the naked eye you could easily see star clusters. I also took these out camping in an area with little to no light pollution with great results.These are very large binoculars. If you are not accustomed to raising your arms over long periods of time while star gazing I suggest purchasing a tripod designed for such (tall enough to stand over your head) At the very least get a monopod. Amazon direct offers one for a good price. I also purchased a ball head mount with pistol grip for easy adjustment.This pair of binoculars comes at a great price. You will find there is a reason for this. There is little to no quality assurance on this product. I had to return these due to grease smudges on the inside of the left lens and a thin 3" long metal tab floating around inside the left side as well. I was able to test these out by closing my left eye. The binoculars obviously needed to be collimated right out of the box (which I didn't bother with because of the other defects).I would have given this product 4 or 5 stars if not for the defects. If I don't have any positive results trying a pair from another brand I'll probably end up buying a new pair in hopes that there are no defects i.
5,For years I've been using a cheap pair of 10x40 binoculars when I didn't have my telescope outside. Even though these are clearly not  high end binoculars I knew I could benefit from having dedicated astro binoculars. The price is perfect for me. The came double boxed and well packaged including a small strap lens covers case and tripod adapter. My first impression is that they are not as heavy as they appear to be. I have little intention of mounting these on a tripod as I want these to be as "grab and go" and possible. If I don't want to lug my 9.25" SCT outside I can grab these on short notice during those " Oh my gosh the sky is gorgeous tonight but I am way to tired to observe with my telescope..." nights. They are also great for larger objects such as the Pleiades Cluster or a quick look at the moon or bright planet. Yes I sometimes brace them to keep them steady but they are easy to hold. I've only used them a few times but look forward to bring them along to the next star party.
4,UPDATE:  The optical lenses fell out when this pair of binoculars were turned upside down (how they would be used for stargazing when mounted on a tripod.  The inner pin sheared off during transport.I returned them via Amazon's excellent return policy and purchased a pair of  Celestron SkyMaster Giant20x80 binoculars.  Will update my experience with these once I receive them.I just received my Celestron Skymaster 15 x 70  binoculars today.  They are very nicely made and have excellent optics.They are on the large side though and thus are better suited for use with a tripod. I purchased mine for stargazing.For about $70 delivered these binoculars are a tremendous value.As such if you are considering purchasing a telescope you would do well to give these serious consideration sincethey work very well for viewing the sky at night and are significantly less expensive than most telescopes and mucheasier to handle.
4,I really liked these !I always wanted to have a binoculars with which I could watch the craters on the moon and I was mesmerised to first look at the moon with those. There have amazing magnification and that could be very useful for someone who needs a tool to take a look at what is out there miles and miles away !Very Heavy. It takes much pain to keep them stable and look at the craters or anything long distance at the highest magnification.The Tripod adapter is useful but I did not get a chance to use it since I think it asks for a very expensive end tripod to hold these binoculars since its weight !I am very satisfied with this pair and I gave it to someone who really liked them. And He is very happy to have them.I would perhaps buy the same brand but even higher magnification ( and that comes with extra few pounds ) I guess.I hope the price does not go up by that time.Thank you.
2,You just can't go cheap on optics.  I thought I'd give it a shot since I wanted something with a large objective lens and high magnification.  Well I'd have been better off spending more instead of messing with an inferior product and having to mess around with returning it. I knew I was gonna send it back almost immediately but I thought I'd test 'em out for a few days just to make sure.  Well I really like the wide field of view and the amount of light the large objective opening lets in.  Other than that not much to like about these binoculars.I didn't mind the weight of these since it actually helped me keep them more steady.  The thing that really made me not like this product was the fact that the collimation was way off right outta the box.It could have been knocked outta whack in shipping but I think it's just poor quality control at the factory.  The quality of the optics wasn't bad for $54 with the view being pretty clear and very bright but seeing double kinda wrecks everything. Oh the lens covers come off if you just look at 'em funny which is aggravating. The neck strap is way to thin and the case is very flimsy for such a large set of binos.Anyway I could go on and on. There are a lot better binos out there for not that much more $$.  I sent these things back and got a pair of Nikon Aculon 10-20X50 binos for $145.  Talk about superior optics! Nikon optics make Cellestron's look kinda bad. The Nikon set wasn't packed any more secure for shipping than the Cellestron and its collimation was perfect out of the box.If you want high magnification with a huge objective lens and you're not too picky on image quality then get these.  Or take that $54 and add a little more to it for something really good.  Like I said you just can't go cheap with optics.  But you don't have to spend hundreds either.  Try 'em if you want to.  Thankfully Amazon is awesome when it comes to returns.4145
4,These are pretty big binoculars with a little weight.  Everything is working fine.  I don't know what other reviewers problems were in the attachment to a tripod.  The tread to screw the mount on has a cap over it that you need to remove. It's on the outer part of the middle swivel.  Mine mounts nice and steady.  It's a nice tripod mount. I left it on my tripod. The SkyMaster focuses sharp..The outer perimeter is fuzzy but you still have plenty of viewing area.  Objects are easy to spot.  I've just received them so I haven't had a chance to use them in the field. I wanted them to view birds.  To help secure the eye lense cover it's all one unit Push it on all the way then twist open the binoculars and that will help hold the cover in place  The outer covers fit pretty well.. The plastic case and binocular strap are a wee bit cheesy but they will do their job.  I gave it 4 stars because of the size and weight.
5,So glad I chose these over the 20 x 80s.  The 15 x 70s are big but are an excellent compromise between size and portability.  The images are great and you get "super power vision" .  I took them down to the bay and could count the windows on houses 3 miles away.  I took them up in the valley and could see climbers on the hillside at dusk.  I bought these for backyard astronomy and am very optimistic they will work great.  I highly recommend a heavy duty professional grade tripod to maximize your enjoyment.  A steady image is much easier to observe than a wobbly one.  I use a professional Ravelli tripod with a pistol grip head that I bought on Amazon.  I also am using a steel binocular tripod mount instead of the plastic one included with the binoculars.  Have fun with your new super power.
4,On the first order the 70mm lenses coating was sub par  the seller sent a return paid label for a replacement the same day that I received the defective item  and sent out a replacement the same day . I received the replacement the next day . I am very pleased with seller and item ( sometimes production problems happen )  . I would recommend Celestron products  too bad all Companies are not as  professional in dealing with their customers . ( A bit of Old School pride )
4,Bought these for my astronomy crazy grandchildren as I'd been told they were easier for kids to use than a telescope. They are beautifully made and obviously quality instruments and will last a long time. They come with a nice case and also an adapter to attach them to a tripod. (wasn't aware and took Amz advice to add an adapter which I later returned.) I did buy tripods for them and am glad I did. Makes it so much easier to look through and avoids the fatigue of trying to use them holding in your hands.
4,I've tried inexpensive telescopes before to try to see stars and planets and could never see anything consistently--the viewing field was just too small. I bought these specifically to look at the sky over my very light-polluted neighborhood on Long Island and from the first use was so thrilled. Without them I look up and see a few stars; with them I could see *many* more stars some nebulae and incredible detail on the moon. For that matter airplanes overhead in the night sky go from blinking lights to discernible aircraft shapes and the quarter moon's dark portion is a clear sphere in the binoculars. Yes it's a bit difficult to hold the binoculars steady and yes they are bulky but I'd expected that. The one negative I would note is that the included neckstrap is *short* and *thin*; even at its longest it puts the binoculars too close to your chin when you're using it and it's so thin that it makes me concerned that it won't hold the almost 4 pounds of binoculars reliably.
4,Worthy Binoculars.  The supplied tripod adapter will need to be upgraded to do anything with these.  I find that the barska model adapter is fine for this purpose.  Celstron supplies a plasic adapter which mounts "less than optimally" on standard photo tripod threads.  My tripod is very heavy duty and the weakest link is that adapter.  You do get lens caps and a somewhat OK bag to carry the binoculars with.  The exit pupil is not that large but you do know how to compute for that as you have the variables to do so with the 15x70mm specifications.  Fine enough for older eyes such as mine but note that the eyecups do roll down (or up) to help.  Without a tripod these are much too heavy and unwiledy to use.  For Astronomy purposes these are excellent price to performance ratio binos.  Get them with a 3rd party adapter and you will be happy.  Have a tripod and you will do best.
5,I bought these binoculars a month ago and love them! They take a few minutes to get perfect focus I thought they were out of wack until I read the manual and really found how to focus them. The method I use is only look with the left eye and use the big dial to focus next open the right eye and push or pull the right eye piece and fine tune by turning the right eye cup.  I can see the Andromeda galaxy from my backyard even with city lights nearby the Pleides cluster looks amazing and I've seen many satellites flying by the moon looks amazing! I have a sturdy Manfroto video cam tripod but the included tripod attachment is to shaky for these binoculars I just bypass the tripod and lay on the floor or a lawn chair and find that's the easiest way to use these. Holding the binoculars around the big ends gives me the most stable view.  I highly recommend them my nieces and nephews love them everyone that tries them wants them and I still can't believe they were $58! If this is you're first step into astronomy like me than click buy now!!!!! I wish I had these as a kid screw Christmas buy these for your loved ones now! One of my best purchases ever!
4,So far so good. I love the light carrying case and the clear broad optics. I can sit outside and see details on the birds. They have also really opened up the night sky to me. The moon is spectacular and I have discovered some strange star clusters that I don't even see in the astronomical charts. On a moonless night you can slightly resolve Jupiter's moons. The only drawback is that they do not resolve Saturn's rings I have to use my telescope for that (hence not 5 stars). But definitely worth your 80 dollars mine arrived in perfect condition in 2 days on free shipping. They would also make a great gift.Update: I would change my review to 5 stars if I could. My binos got too loose so I ordered another pair. I took this second pair to Sedona Arizona. Wow unbelievable views in Sagittarius the center of the galaxy!Open clusters nebulosity globular clusters! Realistically most astronomical eq. is made to be used under very dark skies. Get a pair of these and take them to a nighttime desert sky and look at Sagittarius.
5,I have been very impressed with these which I bought for easy back-yard binocular astronomy. I live in a fairly light-polluted area but I was able to pretty easily pick up the recent Comet Lovejoy when it was between +4 and +5 magnitude. You can easily see M42 (the Orion Nebula) the Pleiades and get good detail in the moon. You can pick out Jupiter's moons. With 15x magnification any motion in your arms when you hold it is magnified. You can address this by holding them near the lenses rather than the place that seems natural to grip or by using some sort of tripod if you want a high degree of stability.The field of view is about 3 degrees (about the span of Orion's belt) which is large enough that large star clusters (like the Pleiades) still look interesting without being over-zoomed into just a star or two like you would get with a telescope.The only thing I've noticed about these binoculars is that they aren't able to focus very well on close objects (i.e.: 50 feet away). But if something's 50 feet away you probably don't want any form of 15x70 binoculars anyways.
5,Iâm happy about the purchase of my new binoculars. They arrived well packaged and secure. Iâve only been able to use them a couple of times we have had a lot of rain on the east coast which hasnât lead to any clear evenings to star gazing. This is definitely a purchase Iâm glad I made and Iâm looking forward to many star gazing nights.
4,These are nice binoculars without a doubt.  I bought them based on the many good reviews and it does live up to them but they are really heavy. I underestimated their weight and bought a undersized tripod my bad. Just know that these require a good quality heavy duty tripod for vibration free viewing. The viewing is clear and easy to dial into focus holding them for any length of time would really be a bear as they are that heavy. I haven't used them too much for the stars but looking at nature is awesome bird watching works for these just fine. I have looked upwards and was not disappointed in the view at all...crystal clear on a dark night. I do recommend for beginners like me who don't want to fool with a telescope set up just yet. Very well packaged and no issues with the product.
5,I HAVE OWNED OTHER BINOCULARS IN MY 68 YEARS THESE ARE WITHOUT A DOUBT MORE BANG FOR YOUR BUCK THAN YOU WILL EVER FIND REGARDLESS OF PRICE YOU WILL PAY THEY ARE RAZOR SHARPCLEAR AND THE 70 MM COATED OBJECTIVE LENS BRINGS IN LOTS OF LIGHT THE 15X70 ARE THE MOST POWERFUL I HAVE FOUND THAT CAN BE HAND HELD FOR GENERAL USE..... I BOUGHT A PAIR OF 25X70 IN THE SAME MODEL FOR TRIPOD USE FOR ASTRONOMY I HAVE A CELESTRON 8" SE SCHMIDT CASSEGRAIN TELESCOPE I ALMOST USE THE BINOCULARS MORE  NOW THEY ARE MORE PORTABLE FASTER SET-UP AND WIDER FIELD OF VIEW TO FIND DEEP SPACE OBJECTS PLUS THE FULL MOON COMES IN AND FILLS THE  FIELD OF VIEW BETTER THAN THE 15X70'S ..... EITHER OF THESE TWO MODELS WILL MAKE YOU SMILE WITH THEIR EXCELLENT QUALITY & AT A RIDICULOUSLY LOW PRICE FOR WHAT YOU GET THE ONLY DOWNSIDE IS THE ADAPTER SUPPLIED WITH THEM THAT ATTACHES THE BINOCULARS TO THE TRIPOD IT VIBRATES ALLOT YOU CAN BUY ONE FOR $12.-$15. MADE OF METAL THAT WILL SOLVE THIS BUT WHAT CAN I SAY= BUY A PAIR YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED!!  FREE SHIPPING & THE LOWEST PRICE HERE AT AMAZON---PERIOD!
4,Bought these for my 34 year old son who loves to star gaze and moon watch. Theyâre very heavy so difficult to focus on a star or the moon without a tripod. It came with a very cheap plastic one that does NOT work. I purchased a separate one that was also too thin and cheap to hold these heavy binoculars. I wouldâve given a five star rating if more information was provided about purchasing a separate tripod.
4,Great pair of binoculars for day and night.  The brightness of the stars you can barely see with your eyes...wow!  They do get heavy after trying to hold them steady for a while.  I also like others had a pair that were not collimated very well and showed a double image. I did carefully peel back the left edge of the right hand rubber grip using a very small flathead screwdriver and found the screw needed to collimate the lenses. A small adjustment to that screw while looking through the lenses fixed the issue... a little dab of super glue to put the grip back in place and everything is good.  Don't be afraid to fix your own if you have the same issue.The tripod mount is not very good...wobbles too much with the weight of the binoculars when attached.A great price and great optics but for having to do my own collimation...4 stars
4,These binoculars are great for looking at the night sky.  I've been able to see a whole bunch more than with just the naked eye including at least two moons of Jupiter the other night without attaching the adapter to a tripod.  The big problem with these binoculars is the weight.  It's very hard to keep the binoculars steady without a tripod.  Even with the tripod adapter the slightest vibration shakes the binoculars quite a bit.  These binoculars are very convenient though when compared to setting up a telescope when you want a quick look at the night sky.  They are also useful for checking out views during the day.  Before sunset I was even able to get a good view of Venus and take a picture through my digital camera.  I had to crop the image but the picture definitely showed the crescent phase of Venus which I thought was pretty neat.  For the price I can't complain too much about these binoculars as they are very powerful.
4,Wanting for some time to get a better view of the stars and motivated by the excellent reviews posted here at amazon I purchased these binoculars two weeks ago. I cannot pretend to write about their performance from a seasoned veteran's perspective; rather I just wish to point out to other newbies like me who are interested in making this purchase that they will definitely have to invest in a tripod. You simply will not be able to remain focused on any celestial objects using these with your hands and arms alone: the images will zigzag around within your field of view at the speed of light. Unfortunately I have not yet purchased a tripod because the compatible Celestron tripod here at amazon has been horribly reviewed and because no information is included on what sort of tripod is compatible and I don't know what my other options are. This means that I haven't really been able to enjoy the binoculars. I also wish to warn potential buyers that these binoculars unlike Celestron's famed telescopes are MADE IN CHINA! You will not be supporting U.S. technological labor by making this purchase.
5,I read all the reviews and figured out that 10 percent would come with bad calibration so I took my chances. I only have one question. How is it possible you can buy something that should be 4 times the money. Mine came out of the box perfect and I mean perfect. You won't need a tripod like some reviews say. All you do is get one of those beach chairs that sit almost on the ground where your butt touches. The ones you buy anywhere and use your elbows as a tripod. Don't even try to get anything over 15x70 because you will need a tripod because of the wobble. I am still in shock about the quality you get for $60.00 dollars. How is it possible to make money at that price. Do not listen to one bad review because they must be smoking something. The reason some of the reviews said it came in and had bad calibration is because UPS drop kicks have of the stuff they deliver. Just look at the 700 bad reviews on the UPS center in Sunnyvale. If you got in from the Sunnyvale California UPS then they probably played punt pass and kick with it which would surely screw it up.
5,I bought these binoculars along with a Sunpak 9002DX Tripod from Amazon and received both recently.The first night I got them even though the temperature where I live were in single digits Fahrenheit I just had to go out into the land out back and test them out.The collimation of the binoculars I received is perfect and the clarity of the images I can see is astounding for such a low price unit.Using the tripod I was easily able to find the Andromeda Galaxy in seconds even though our moon's glare was only 30 degrees or so away and focusing on the moon itself was a joy to behold - these binoculars capture an incredible amount of light.There is just so much to see with these binoculars in the night sky at 15x magnification it can't fail to make you feel totally humbled looking up on a clear night.I notice some people have complained about the plastic tripod adapter not being quite up to the job when used with some tripod units but with the tripod I bought (see above) I have no complaints at all - it feels strong and secure when in place.Treat yourself to these binoculars now with a tripod stand and reawaken that sense of wonder we all had when we were children!
3,These presented a crystal-clear picture even at maximum distance.  Why did I return them?1. The binoculars are very heavy and practically demand the use of a tripod either for sky gazing or for extended viewing (i.e. more than a few seconds) of earth-bound objects.2. The provided neck strap is too narrow and I don't think it is adequate for very heavy binoculars.  This same strap had no extra width or padding for the neck either.3. The provided carrying bag would need to be replaced within months with something more sturdy as it is thin weak and slightly undersized for the binoculars.  The velcro closure seemed too weak to safely hold these very heavy and large binoculars.For tripod use only I feel that these binoculars would offer many exciting viewing experiences.  Of course a telescope belongs on a tripod the viewfinder is usually at a 90-degree angle for easier viewing and a telescope would probably be easier to reposition on a tripod compared to binoculars.Certainly it depends on what you are most comfortable with.  After all these are really fun to look through!  I just couldn't hold them steady and felt like I might drop them either from my neck or out of the bag. So I returned them.
4,Bought these to use over the water and I love them (especially for the price) now that I have them fixed but here's the catch: Unless you have freaky steady hands you need to use these on a tripod and the plastic tripod adapter is very poorly designed. It seems to work fine but there is way too much flex in it. Every time you looked though them the field of view was bouncing back and forth so much you couldn't see anything. Eventually things would settle down but if you so much as took a breath it would start shaking again. I blamed my cheap tripod at first but finally realized the fault was in the tripod adapter twisting back and forth.The fix was cheap and easy though it took awhile for me to think of it: I bought some epoxy putty ("JB Weld" by brand) and packed it in the hollows on both sides of the adapter. Everything is rock steady now but if I hadn't figured this out the binoculars would be essentially useless.
2,extremely heavy probably best suited on a tripod
5,My first impressions are that these are great binos. I used for about 12 hours some bird watching and daytime exploring and some nighttime stargazing with the kids. Wasn't too much for the day and worked well at night. Could make out two of Jupiter moons could see that Venus was about half phase and the moon looked great the kids loved it. Attempted to find some more distant objects could make out that Saturn is not a circle but more oval. Couldn't make out the rings. Unsuccessfully looked for M13 wasn't best conditions at that point. Got my butt up to look for Mercury and M31 early as they both are visible about 3:50 am but it was cloudy a that point.The tripod adapter is a weak link and i recommend a better one for serious viewing.The best uses so far are to get a better look at the bright stars and there colors fun to look at the planets and the moon looks great.Getting a tripod as even tho I'm a big guy they still fatigued me a bit after a few minutes.All in all they work as described and are enjoyable to use.
3,I purchased the binoculars as an alternative to lugging a 6 or 10 inch dobsonian outside for quick views.  The optics are not as clear as I anticipated.  The field is not crisp to the edges.  Looking at the moon The image suffers from a rainbow color effect.  The positives are that you can view clusters with detail similar to a small telescope.  Globular clusters are partially resolved and stand out in contrast to the background.  Open clusters are resolved.  Deep sky object are found making them easier to find with a telescope.  It is  fun and enjoyable to find objects with the 15x 70s. I can not wait to view M-31 or M-42 with them.  M-8 shows resolution.  A tripod makes it easier to steady.  But resting your elbows on a railing helps immensely.  They may fall short in the quality I was hoping to get. But I use them often and for $64.95 they are well worth the investment.  They are well above and beyond my 10x50.  Including the optical imperfections.
5,Excellent for low-hassle stargazing though it's hard to hold them steady because they're so big and heavy. A tripod mount is included but they're so heavy that the mount has trouble keeping them still; you get some vibration if you touch the eye cups with your face. Be very ginger when looking through them on a tripod to avoid the shaking.As for what you can see keep in mind that these are 15x magnification so your field of vision will be somewhat small. It takes a little practice to aim at the objects you want to see. I'm in the suburbs toward the north end of Los Angeles so it's not exactly dark here but I can see the following:-- The glow of the Orion nebula is very clear.-- The Pleiades are very bright.-- The Andromeda galaxy is a faint blur but I can always find it.-- There are just a lot more visible stars anywhere you aim.-- The moon is super bright and you can see quite a bit of detail.
1,I have owned several of these. Earlier models produced around 2000 were poorly packaged and the collimation was consistently bad. However Celestron said they fixed this but unfortunately recent orders indicate the problem still exists. It was very evident the moment I looked through the latest pair. Collimation is the optical concentricity of both sides of the binoculars coming to one point. If binoculars are not collimated one eye sees an image in a different location than another. So one target is high or to the left or both and the other is on. This is a factory defect and is exclusive to the 15 x 70mm binoculars. I have purchased the rest of the Celestron line and they are fine. Hopefully this review will get to Celestron so they can fix the problem. Some people won't see it but as an astronomer with very acute vision if the object doesn't come to one point in both I see it.  This isn't to do with focus so there's no misunderstanding.
4,These are huge
5,I would recommend the Celestron - SkyMaster Giant 15x70 Binoculars to anyone with an eye for the sky.
5,I bought two pairs of these binoculars with rather low expectations considering what other people had to say.  Some good some bad but it certainly caused me to question whether or not i should buy these.  I'm a rebel and said you know what I'm not going to buy a pair...I'll buy TWO.  I have a friend who decided he wanted a pair also so I added them to my cart and it was done.  When they arrived I unpacked the first pair which I immediately saw double vision which I was prepared for so I though well so much for that.  Next pair AMAZING no double vision excellent magnification a tad heavy but well a well rounded inexpensive way to soak in the amazing night sky.  Would I buy these again?  Absolutely!  Was I happy?  Yes sir great price ease of use and the tripod adapter that some people squawk about...it's fine just need a tripod now.  Remember these binoculars are under $45 so am I going to get $300 quality? No.  Did I expect it?  No.  Just buy yourself a pair and enjoy the sights!!
5,My wife is an astronomy nut and she is VERY pleased with these binoculars!
5,The telescope is great. It does the job as described.I have few suggestion for users with young kids.- Always you sturdy tripod. Using Cheap Tripods from local big box store really not help. The objects in sky move fast and you need to ensure that your telescope move freely with this- Try to find a good view of the sky. My back and front yard are full with the trees and very hard to see the sky at night I drove literally around 60 miles to Delaware water gap to watch the sky with the kids. It was fun.- You need to adjust the focus for the kids everytime different heights of the kids like to use the telescope. I have 4 kids and man it was a struggle to ensure they can see the sky and same time not overwhelmed with the scope.- Look for less light on sky or stay away from city lights if you want to have a great view.Nature is great and you should enjoy the night sky.
3,I was so excited to get these and expected to see the rings and the moons on Jupiter and Saturn as their paths got in line with each other to form something as bright as the Bethlehem star.  I started looking at the two planets every night for the three nights before their grand finale but even with the help of three other people making adjustments none of us could make out moons or rings.  Even the Earth's moon didn't look much different then it did through a pair of regular much smaller binoculars.  AND you do need to use a tripod to look at anything or whatever is in the view finder just squiggles around.
5,Crystal clear perfect focus. Son and I stood outside looking at the moon and stars last night better / clearer views than a Celestron Powerseeker 80eq. I mean CRYSTAL CLEAR and PERFECT focus. Best binoculars I've ever looked through. Will probably buy a second pair so I don't have to share. :)
4,For the price these are very good binoculars.  But quality control is hit or miss.  The first pair I received were severely misaligned so much so that I was seeing double of everything and could not correct the problem with the few adjustments that are possible without pulling out the jeweler's screwdrivers.  Thanks to Amazon's terrific return policy I sent the first pair back and ordered a replacement.  Thankfully this second pair is excellent.  The view is very clear and crisp and focusing is a snap.  Despite their rather large appearance (compared to the old 7X50s they are replacing) these binoculars are easy to hold and reasonably light weight.  I'm sure a lot of plastic is being used so they might not survive a drop like old metal-bodied binocs but I'd rather save the extra weight and just be careful when using them (or mount them on a tripod with the included adapter).
4,These were very good quality but far too large and heavy for me to carry on an African safarið
4,I ordered these because it seemed like a great price for a quality piece. I knew there were some who received defective pieces but I gambled and ordered. The ones that arrived for me were out of collimation and I didn't want the hassle of returning them to the USA (I live in Canada). The reviews mentioned how you could lift up the rubber and discover an adjustable set screw that is not mentioned in the owner's manual. I followed the advice given and set up my binoculars on a tripod and focused on a distant roofline. I had already followed the instructions in the manual to get the best possible focus but was still seeing double images. I adjusted only one screw and VOILA everything came together in a crisp image. After this simple adjustment I now own a great pair of binoculars. My son was impressed and wants a pair for himself. I use them for astronomy and for hunting - although they are very heavy for that purpose.
5,With Mars Jupiter and Saturn prominent in our nighttime sky right now these have been fun to have around. Even on full moon nights these provide an up-close view of our lunar friend. Last night there was a fireworks show near by why not a clue but try watching fireworks through these it was a blast :D thank me later for that one! My only issue is a few days later they went on sale for a much better price is there a price guarantee?
5,Heavier side but excellent quality. I didn't trust the harness that cane with it so I got the Vortex optics Vino harness that held these 4 lbsnder well hands free.I will most certainly recommend heavy duty tripod with pan and tilt mechanisms since I cannot hold them steady for long duration and I am not the weakest person. Jupiter ( bright spot) and its moons(tiny dots) are clearly visible. Saturn and Venus appear as bright spots. Lot of different constellation visible even in light pollution. I wear glasses and have no issues with these. Craters on moon will leave you breathless. I use these with my Pentax 10x50s to scan the Sky. I narrow down the object with Pentax binoculars because those have wide field of view due to lower magnification. Then I use these to observe more details. Get a good quality tripod where you can mount binoculars to avoid back pain. I though prefer for tripod less long duration viewing simply due to light weight. Note that these are not water resistant but that's okay since one cannot view the stars in rain.
5,Was a little hesitant to buy such powerful binoculars because I thought theyâd need to be mounted on a tripod. I was wrong to wait. They are easily handheld and the optics are great. We live on the water and these are perfect for bird and boat watching. Yes they are big but they really do the job.
5,I ordered these on a whim. I have always wanted a good pair of high powered binocs but hesitated over the cost. When I happened on these I read the reviews and I must say I agree with the 5 star ratings. They are large but surprisingly light. They have a good field of view and the optics are really good with a sharp crisp image. I live in a rural area and am always trying to see what critters are roaming about the place and these are perfect. Yes because of the size holding them by hand does cause shaking but if you want to see if that deer on the hill is a buck or a doe they are great. They bring the mountains on the moon into sharp clear focus and the trees on the ridgeline of the mountain a few miles away are sharp and clear. I do not think you could find anything better for the price. And with the tripod mount that is included star gazing and wildlife watching is easy. I highly recommend them.
5,Me gustÃ³ su poder e imagen...Buena resoluciÃ³n...
4,I bought these binoculars to view celestial objects quickly in lieu of a setting up my telescope.  They are fantastic provided you mount it to a sturdy tripod and heavy duty mount.  I initially bought it as a combo deal with a 'value' tripod.  When mounted the binoculars shook even in a light wind.  I replaced the tripod with a Ravelli APGL4 New Professional 70" Tripod with Adjustable Pistol Grip Head (probably more tripod than needed) which corrected most of the shake.  However the plastic mount that comes with the binoculars had too much flex resulting in vibration when bringing a celestial object into view.  Substituting a die cast Oberwerk Heavy-duty L Adapter fully addressed this issue.The views are fantastic.  I can clearly see Jupiter and at least 4 moons as well as the Orion Nebula from my back yard in the city.  It's great for cold nights when you want to quickly view the sky.
3,I'll start off with a few words about the optical quality which in my opinion is very good. You really can't find a better deal on binoculars for this aperture size and magnification. That being said this is a little bit TOO good of a deal where the added magnification becomes a problem.These binoculars NEED some sort of sturdy mount. I bought them as an upgrade from naked eye astronomy-I wanted something that would give me views of some of the fainter objects in the sky (messier objects star clusters exc) without me needing to make the big purchase of a telescope or any sort of tripod. Unfortunately these binos just have too much power to be steadily held in the hands. Even when lying on my back I had problems keeping them steady as every object I observed looked like dancing streaks of light through the binos. It was really quite frustrating. I eventually decided to build a parallelogram binocular mount which has made my experiences with these binoculars much much better. The wide view makes star clusters look fantastic you can see Jupiter and 4 of its moons as well as faint views of the messier objects.All in all these are fantastic binoculars IF and ONLY IF you have some way of mounting them. Unfortunately this defeats a large part of the simplicity of binocular astronomy-the ability to go out on a whim with nothing but the binos and enjoy a night under the stars. The binoculars themselves are of great quality and you can't beat the price-just make sure that you know you will need some sort of binocular mount before you purchase them.
5,I purchased these binoculars for astronomy at the recommendation of a friend. The large number of reviews speaks for itself. My first pair came in instantly due to prime however they were out of collimation. It seemed like someone returned them previously and they were mistakenly shipped to me. I left a note on the box to prevent another disappointed customer. Amazon did however immediately ship another pair and the return was easier than expected. I put it back in the box and UPS picked it up the next day. The new pair arrived two days later.The 15x70's bring in an unbelievable amount of light. I don't find them difficult at all to hold while laying back but standing could get a bit tiring. While I haven't been able to make out very many deep sky objects you should easily be able to see the Orion Nebula The Pleiades Beehive Cluster and many more. Don't be dissuaded from purchase due to low price or chance of defect... These really are a great bargain. I haven't used my telescope since I purchased these.
5,I ordered these about two weeks ago and just started using them to view the moon (YOWZER--do they bring in the light!) and to view raptors ducks and other birds a half mile across a section of the Susquehanna River below the Conowingo Dam.  I was floored by how well these did. I can not only see incredible detail on birds in the middle of the river on small islands but birds completely on the other side sitting in trees.  My husband was able to identify a blue jay sitting in the shrubs on the opposite bank.  They are NOT heavy to use without a tripod.  I have arthritis in both hands and could use them easily propping my elbows occasionally on a nearby fence but that was just to steady myself in the brisk wind NOT because they were too heavy.  I am very happy I did not go with my first instinct to get a spotting scope and tripod.  I was walking from spot to spot easily picking out different winter visitors while another fellow viewing birds had to keep folding up his spotting scope and tripod moving unfolding tripod resetting scope--too annoying!This works very well at the half-mile distance I am using it and closer distances are a delight!  Very pleased with this buy!
5,These astronomy binoculars get a bad rap from some in the astronomy community because they're not as pricey as the high end binoculars. Collimation was spot on and the optics are flawless. The views you get from these are amazing. Was able to make out good detail of Orion's Nebula and could see the center of Andromeda. I live under light polluted skies so I'm looking forward to taking these out to darker skies.
5,My girlfriend gave me a pair of these for my birthday. They arrived with detailed but easy to follow instructions for the beginner particularly as regards adjusting the focus for the first time. They looked and felt magnificent like all finely constructed tools and instruments. I headed out to a nearby wide open space and used my new Celestron Skymaster Giant 15x70 Binoculars to look out across the prairie immediately appreciating the workout these hefty glasses were gonna give my biceps and I recall mentally congratulating myself on having had the good sense to wear a muscle revealing tank top that day...far off in the distance beyond the limits of mere human eyesight I beheld the lone figure of another man coincidentally also looking at stuff through a pair of binoculars that were as impressively huge as my own and get this--we were wearing the same hat!...then I realized I was actually looking at the back of my own head. Buy these now quick before God or Mother Nature finds out we puny humans now have eyes as powerful as hawks or Superman and uninvents them. If these things were any stronger I do believe they could actually see into the future. Thanks Celestron...these babies are pure magic.
5,Skyview 15 x 70. The ordering page is confusing. The description correctly says the tripod bracket is included but in ordering I was forced to choose "binoculars" only or binoculars "w/ tripod adapter" or binoculars "w/ basic smartphone adapter." I wanted the adapter so I chose "w/ tripod adapter." The result was an automatic order for the binoculars (which comes with the case and tripod adapter) and a separate order for another tripod adapter.I am returning the second tripod adapter because I did not want two of them.
5,I give this product five stars because for the discounted price of $60. you just can't go wrong.  Binoculars of almost any size are a great way to get started -- or stay involved -- in astronomy and these Celestron giant binoculars are perfect to view wide swaths of sky about 4.5 degrees wide. Beautiful!You can start off doing binocular astronomy with an ordinary set of you probably have around the house; but when you want to have more 'light-grabbing' ability and a bit more magnification these giant binoculars can economically fill the bill.  Also be aware these are a bit on the heavy side and that using the included tripod adapter on a mono-pod or tripod or using them while you're seated to steady them are just a few ways to assist in holding the bino's steady.  There are several books available here on Amazon to guide the newbie or old-timer make the most of their nights spent under the stars with more hints on how to hold and steady this kind of binocular as well as point you to the night sky's greatest wonders.Clear Skies and Great Viewing!
4,I ordered these binoculars because they seemed to have good reviews. First they didn't come with the kens caps or rain guard.  I was told I would have to return the entire package just to get these items. I didn't want to do that as it was to be a gift and I wouldn't receive a new binocular until after the birthday. Wasn't sure why a set of lens caps couldn't just be sent out. Anyway the binoculars when busing thru them showed double.  A friend of mine watched a video on how to collimate them and was able to fix the double image problem. Other then that these are very nice and the moon looks incredible through them.
5,I bought these while Amazon had them in stock awesome value for the price. Being prudent I first looked at the negative reviews. Almost all the negative reviews from someone who knew a little about binoculars were from receiving bins out of collimation and one or 2 with just bad luck in manufacturing defects. It is important to read the reviews and not just take the stars. The few other negative reviews not about collimation were either for the wrong product or just clueless. So I figured for the price if they were off I'd adjust them myself but got lucky they were spot on.  There is some blurring in the outer field of view. That is the difference between a $50 pair and a $400 pair. I'll keep the $350 and deal with it.  Terrestrial viewing is awesome pulls things right in. Night time terrestrial viewing these really shine. I about jumped scanning a field and finding a deer illuminated only by a streetlamp 1/4 mile away. Only had a chance to view Jupiter through a hole in the clouds. Sharp and bright with good contrast.  My only complaint is the minimum interpupillary distance is just barely passable for my eyes. Keep this in mind if considering for children they may not be able to use these.
3,I previously had a pair of 25X100 binoculars. They were just too heavy for me to use comfortably.I wanted a lighter weight large binocular for astronomy.At the price I decided to try these. I wish Celestron had better âQAâ. The first pair was seriously out of collimation.  That seems to be a common problem with these.Amazonâs return police is excellent the only downside is having to drive to the UPS store.The second pair I got the next day was properly collimated. Being as these are inexpensive binoculars they do a pretty good job. I mounted them on an Orion paragon plus mount.I had a lot of enjoyment sweeping through various star clusters and nebula.Remember that these are inexpensive binocâs they do exhibit a purple fringe around bright objects like the crescent moon Jupiter and Venus.  Also thereâs a very noticeable fringe around objects during the day. But seeing as how I bought these for sweeping the night sky thatâs not a problem for me.I think that these are a pretty good value. I gave three stars due to the bad first pair.
4,This was on my wish list long enough to get purchased before my continued research took it off.The collimation seems to be very bad as I am unable to get a clear view through both eyes.Update 30 minutes later:Funny how posting a review pushes to action sometimes.  I kept searching and today I found the how-to.  These are very simple to collimate (to align the two eyes to avoid seeing double).  All it needed was a small flathead screwdriver (I think mine is 2.4mm) and a tripod aimed at a neighbor's roofline.  Fixed in 20 minutes without opening it up or breaking any seals!  Upgrading to 4 stars and eager to try it out on the stars tonight.  The adjustment screws are just under the rubber grip right at the edge closest to the small lenses you look through.
5,These binocs are awesome. They're basically a telescope for each eye. I bought the Vista Explorer 60" tripod with it and wouldn't use them without it or some form of tripod for stabilization. On a clear night you can easily make out Jupiter and can even see some of its moons. I love how wide the field of vision is with them. With the swivel capability of my tripod I can easily follow planes through the sky and even make out tail numbers at a good distance. They're also great for seeing downrange while target shooting or whatever other application you can think of. The aperture of these binocs lets a lot of light in and if you're not careful you can damage your eyes so you gotta be careful during the day. But because of that they also make for some good sight seeing binocs because you can see more in lowlight situations. They're rather large so they'd be cumbersome to carry around all the time and they are somewhat heavy (another reason to get a good tripod). All in all I love em.
3,This is my first decent pair of binoculars so it is difficult to compare to others. Also since I bought this sight unseen via the reviews etc. have no recent experience. I use these in the daytime as well as the night. Just moved to a new apartment overlooking the ocean so always plenty of activity going on. I will say that I am very pleased with them. Yes they are a bit heavy so the right set up is important. The image is clear and bright. Distant objects are magnified well. At night these pick up stars you could only imagine being there with the naked eye. Since I live on the East Coast near Boston it isn't a prime location for stargazing. But even here the sky gets filled with stars. Last week we had a full moon and the view was amazing. I was sure I could see Wallace and Grommit....UPDATESo it is now about six months post purchase and a problem has arisen. Both eye cups are now torn one almost completely off. Since I typically use eyeglasses the cups are folded down. ONCE I turned them up since I had my contacts in. That's when the right cup tore and the left one soon after. Very poor quality materials not durable at all.I contacted customer service at Celestron. Their initial response was a link to an irrelevant problem solution. In writing back I was told that for $25 I could return them for a replacement or problem fix. Some deal! At this point I will be looking for a local store to purchase replacement cups and hope I can find durable ones for less than $25.
1,Iâll admit I dropped them but only off the couch busted the right Iâll cap off and the more I look at it it never did focus and if you look close were plus and minus move itâs just a straight slut does not move up and down at an angle.  Thereâs lots of glue in this area for some reason almost like somebody glued it and sent them back and then I received them but Iâm not sure is anyone else having this problem I see a couple reviews?If you notice thereâs a lot of glue maybe that lens is glued so much it doesnât spin to focus can anyone out there help me and show me if there pair moves Or is it the same as mine!! I contacted customer service they will do nothing because it will cost just as much to ship them back-and-forth as I paid for them go figure I would not waste my money on these go with vortex or maven if you want a good pair  Do you think I would know better you get what you pay forð¤·ââï¸LGB
5,I simply do not understand those individual who rated this item with 1 or 2 stars due to the 'weight of the binoculars'. Did they not read the description that said the weight was 3.3 pounds? Did they not read the product review that recommended a tripod for extended use? Comments should fairly and accurately rate the product not the inadequacies of the commentators.  The shipping was extraordinarily fast...2 days from the date of order. The binoculars were well made and the optics were surprisingly clear and bright given the $58 dollar price. Eye relief was good. Focus was sharp. Yes the binoculars are heavier than your 10 x 20's but then again the optics are bigger and made for astronomical use. The tripod mount works as intended. If you think you'll get a pair of Fujinon quality binoculars for $56 then you'll be disappointed. Having said that these are a good pair of binoculars for the money. The case is cheaply made and the binoculars should have come with separate eyepiece covers but other than that I am satisfied with the quality of the binoculars..
4,Nice quality for the money lightweight and i love the rubberized finish. Me
4,Talk about "bang for the buck".  Anyone who wants or needs just one set of binoculars around the house would be hard pressed to find any better value for the $59.99 price--especially when they are the "daily deal" for $49.99!  Easy to adjust and use great magnification and clarity and good light gathering ability.  I was a little worried about what I was getting for that price but it turned out to be a very pleasant surprise.We have three other pairs of older binoculars in the house but none offer the combined  capabilities of this pair in one package.  The only really weak point is the provided tripod adapter which is poorly constructed of weak plastic.  Anyone who needs the stability of a tripod will have to look elsewhere for a capable adapter.
4,I can see the moon very clearly with these! Quite impressive but because of the size its hard to keep it stable if you only hold them with your hands.I took one star off because of the bag it comes with which is very very poor quality. its super thin and will not protect the binoculars at all.
4,This product has a good solid feel to it and the focus adjustment is smooth and easy to operate while viewing. I was actually hoping to use this item for birding but it turns out that the minimum focus distance is too far. On distant objects the binoculars do focus easily and provide a good sharp image. But the distance is so great a bird is just too small at that range to pick out much detail. My less-powerful binoculars work better for bird watching. I had the opportunity to watch an air show with the Celestron SkyMaster binoculars and it was excellent. Very good views of the planes excellent detail. I have not used them for night-sky viewing so can't comment on them in that regard. I would recomment this product for anybody who wants binoculars capable of delivering a good clear image at considerable distance provided the subject is not too small.
5,Kudos to Celestron! I didn't think the binoculars would be of such high quality for the price but they most definitely were worth it. As a budding amateur astronomer I decided to go the binocular route instead of trying futilely to get my small telescopes to work. Fortunately I found these for a great price on Amazon and have used these constantly ever since. They're simple and straight-forward tripod-adaptable and aren't too heavy for just hand-held observation. And with their incredible field of view they're perfect for the beginner--you can look easily for a landmark star or constellation and move around to find your target. In city lights I've been able to see many of the Messier objects in Sagittarius and Leo a very cratered very large and very bright full moon the Galilean moons of Jupiter and the Orion Nebula with ease. I've even used them to start mini-star parties and have handed them off (albeit reluctantly) to passersby who were stunned with what they could see. And once Saturn comes out from hiding behind the Sun its moons will be next on the list. But I digress. Perfect for the beginner. Fantastic quality job Celestron! I love 'em and they'll be in my pack whenever I expect to be under a starry sky.
5,I ordered these because of the strong overall reviews.  The first pair I received had a serious optical flaw.  They were basically useless.  Why the 5 stars?  I believe the packaging was sufficient for nearly all shipping issues but decided to account the flaw to possible extreme rough handling during the Christmas shipping frenzy.  I wanted a replacement pair and feared even the return of the same pair.  This was not the case.  The 2nd pair I received turned out to have the best optical alignment of any pair of binoculars I have looked through.  I have always seen some type of distortion but these are perfect.  "It is possible that I received the lucky pair but those pair are now mine.  I don't want sales to be impacted by me stating that anyone else ordering these can not get as lucky as me but I can not overstate enough that I found the golden ticket.  So perfect is the alignment that the value of them is in the multitudes more than the cost I paid.
5,I've had these binocular for 4 years and they are a solid product for start gazing and terrestrial viewing. I originally bought them for viewing a bird feeder about 40 feet from our house but it was too close. However I do pack them around when hiking and other outdoor activity. I found I can use them without a tripod for terrestrial viewing but they are rather heavy after a while. If I'm not holding them to my face all the time it's acceptable.They are great for star gazing. The moon really pops into view when you use them and you can easily pick out the larger nebula's and open clusters with these. You do want a sturdy tripod with a strong fluid head so you can target them quickly with minimal backlash. I have a cheap tripod and it's next to useless but I am saving for a sturdier one.
5,I've been using these for a few weeks now and I'm extremely pleased with them. At night you can see the craters of the moon with great clarity. Other people had commented about the weight of these being too much to comfortably hold after a few minutes but for me once I've got the correct focus I hold them as close to the open lenses as possible (farthest away from my eyes) and it's no problem. The shaking is not too noticeable then either. Putting my arms down for 30 seconds is enough to rest them and start looking again. I haven't tried them with a tripod yet since I don't have one and for my casual viewing holding has been fine. I like the rubberized matte finish. It makes it easy to grip and feels well constructed. I feel like for the price of these there's nothing to complain about here. I would have paid more for what I've gotten.
5,These binoculars are wonderful.  I have not experienced any quality/collimation problems with mine (Bought January 2010).  Was tracking high altitude fighter jets practicing dogfighting over the city last night.  These are excellent for looking at the moon The Pleiades and other distant objects.  They are much more practical than my telescope for away from home use.  They get used a lot because they are cheap mobile and work well.  If they break or get lost I'll just buy a new pair which I can't say about the telescope.Thought I could use these with just a pair of steady hands.  The other reviewers are right in that I did need to order a tripod.  You can steady your arms against something like a tree and get a stable view for a few minutes.  If you are going to be out looking for more than 5-10 minutes you will most definitely want a tripod.  It's not just the stability either.  Your forearms may go numb after about 10-15 minutes especially if you are wearing a heavy winter coat. If you don't already have one save yourself some time and maybe some shipping costs and just order the tripod at the same time.
3,Shouldâve returned them as soon as I received them but forgot. Theyâre not worth what I paid. Unhappy because an identical item on here includes the tripod mount and cell phone adapter for a cheaper cost than I paid for just the cheap low quality binoculars. You get what you pay for with optics. However Iâm pissed because I feel like I have found out of $30 in accessories. Sure 30 bucks isnât that much but Iâd rather have it in my pocket than yours.
4,Tienen buena amplificaciÃ³n y buena imagen.
4,These binoculars are a terrific value for the money I spent on them. For astronomical use they are very good for viewing the moon and making quick searches for objects to look at. The coatings on the lenses make seeing fine detail difficult. I can only just vaguely see the rings of Saturn with them. Also your tripod and adapter have to be extremely stable. A $25.00 plastic tripod won't cut it. Also the tripod adapter that comes with these has to be stiffened up with epoxy putty to make it stop wobbling. For terrestrial use these are quite good! I can spot things 15 and 20 miles away with surprising clarity. However I have the advantage of a very stable (and expensive) tripod and stability is very important when using these. Handheld these binoculars would be excellent to use at concerts sporting events and for bird watching. I paid $61 for these but the quality is worth much more!
5,So I ready a million reviews on these. I worried and fretted and posted on cloudynights and prepared myself to deal with collimating them. At first I was quite frustrated and had lots of focus / double vision issues. Turns out that my issue was incredibly simple and weirdly non-intuitive. I simply needed to WIDEN them. As in spread them apart further than I felt was proper. Like magic everything snaps into focus and I can even easily use them with my glasses on if I fold the cups down. Yes they are a bit tough to stabilize due to their high power and you will want to rest them on something or get a monopod. What a great deal and I am SO GLAD I took the chance on them.
3,This is a reasonable pair of binoculars to use for astronomy but it certainly has limitations. The wide aperture does a reasonable job at pulling light. I could not see the bands of Jupiter but I could see it had moons Orion nebula was a fuzzy patch but worth viewing and the stars of Pleiades come through pretty well.  But I went to Yellowstone this winter to look at wildlife and unfortunately there was no comparison of this binocular to my 10x40 Nikon Monarch binocular. (To be fair the Nikon's cost ~3x the price.) The Nikon's were so much clearer.  The landscape/animals were clearer and there was less eyestrain in focusing with the Nikon. We pretty much stopped using the Celestron.The other issue I had was with collimation. The first pair I received was not collimated (there was a double image which could not be corrected). I sent them back and got a new pair which seemed fine. But after the end of my week in Yellowstone the collimation was off on these too. I searched on the internet and found the access point to the screw to adjust the collimation. I corrected it but these don't seem very robust. I didn't treat these binoculars any different than the Nikon but the optics on the Celestron shifted.Overall this is a reasonable pair of binoculars. I might recommend them to a friend on a budget but I'd tell them to be very careful handling them.
5,Soy nueva en la compra de binoculares pero me gustaron mucho se ve Clarita la luna y las estrellas hermosas lo Ãºnico que si recomiendo es comprar el adaptador para el tripiÃ© porque el binocular es muy sensible con la mano y pues me tiembla mucho y no se queda steady. No estÃ¡ taaan pesado y pues para ser principiante si me gusto me compra
5,Good product.  Satisfied
5,Was looking for a quality pair of binoculars at a reasonable price and found them.I use these for viewing the night sky and they do a very nice job. They give me very nice views of double stars star clusters and some nebulae. When getting them under a truly dark sky they had a feast of picking out Messier objects and scanning the Milky Way was spectacular. I even found the elusive M101 with the first quarter moon out!Gushing aside they are made solidly and give me the impression that they will last for a long time a rare thing these days. The included stand for attachment to a tripod is nice too because they are a little heavy and I find myself having to take frequent breaks from viewing to let my arms rest. But the optical quality is worth the pain and if you mount them then you won't even have that problem. The case is padded and includes a lens wipe. Given the quality versus other more expensive similar items I don't know why you would choose anything else.
5,I did SO much research on binoculars before buying these for my husband's bday. Let me save you the research time this pair is THE BEST!! It's good quality sleek/beautiful and you can see further than we could have ever imagined! And the image in view is as crisp and clear as if you were standing right there and not miles away! Be sure to get a tripod too as I'd suggest for all powerful binoculars. Happy viewing!
4,These arrived reasonably timely.  The covering for the eyepieces does not fit well enough to stay on them.  The optics are without remark.  The finish of the rest of the glasses is fine.  They are heavy but I knew they would be.  They were purchased to whale watch off my lanai in Hawaii and fit on a tripod well enough.  They are pretty top heavy so there is no real balance to them.  Again they are so large most people understand they are to be used on a fixed base.  They would be great for gazing at the moon and even a bit for Jupiter for the beginning astronomer.  I consider them a good buy for the price as long as the optics and binoculars hold up over time.
4,I've been using the binoculars for stargazing an I've seen more deep space objects in the last few nights than in months using a cheap refractor.  Even better I'm doing this from a light polluted backyard and still seeing things I've never seen before.Stars are bright sharp and crisp while nebulae show nice detail beyond the hazy blobs I'm used to seeing.The only drawback is that the tripod adapter isn't very sturdy.  When I try to look through the binoculars when they are on the tripod they shake and vibrate every time I get close to them.  The binoculars are just too heavy to be stable when supported by such a small piece of plastic.But this is a small quibble and I'm working on a way to strengthen the adapter to cut down on the vibration.  IN the meantime I support the binoculars by gripping them at the ends of the barrels and rest my elbows pn a support.
3,My granddaughter and I are getting into star gazing. Got her a starter Celestron telescope and wanted to get a fairly powerful binoculars--but not pay for a top-of-the line model. So I knew I was buying a lesser-quality pair.PROS: Price trusted manufacturer. Rubber eye cups collapse out of the way if you wear glasses. 15x power is great; angle of view is about four fingers at arm's length. It comes with an attachment that allows you to mount it on a tripod--which is what I recommend. I've never looked through an expensive high-power pair so I can't tell you how good the image quality is; but it's okay for my amateur eyes.CONS: Its heavy weight made it difficult to hold it steady while focusing--first through the left eye with center knob then the right eye with the right eyepiece THEN with both eyes and the center knob again. It says minimum focus up to 45 feet but I didn't find this to be the case. The case is a thin flimsy nylon pouch and there's no dedicated pouch for the tripod accessory--they should have made a pouch on the outside to eliminate it scratching the lens while stored. (They come with rubber lens covers though.)BOTTOM LINE: As long as you know you're buying a cheaper instrument you'll be fine with this. 3 1/2 stars if I could.
3,The third pair of these I received today finally worked.  The first two pairs were both badly defective misaligned and impossible to use.  Clearly they're achieving the low price point partly by using zero quality control because if somebody had simply looked through the other two pairs they would have noticed a problem.  However once I finally got a functional example they're great for the price which let's remember is amazingly low.  They are big black rubbery clunky and not sexy at all.  The lens covers are useless and the bag is pretty awful.  They are not a lust-provoking object.  But what they do namely transmitting light in a coherent manner they do very well (when of course. they're assembled correctly).  The optical quality is really truly exceptional.  They are sharper clearer and render better color than some far more expensive (but somewhat more compact) binos I've tried.  For around fifty bucks I'm impressed and keeping them.  Five stars for function two stars for appearance and one star for quality control.  They do have a lifetime warranty so that's a comfort and a factor in my decision to keep them rather than saving up for something nicer.  Conditionally recommended and make sure you get a pair that's really right.
5,Bought these on Astromart for 60 bucks shipped used but Like New condition. Amazon's price is SUPER for a new set less than 10 bucks more shipped. I've looked through many high power binos over the past 20 yrs. & by far these have them all beat hands down for the price. Reviewers have said there heavy but I'll be honest I can hold them as steady as a pair of 50mm. The long barrels have that heavy look but I think their lightweight compared to Barska or Oberwerk 70mm. With great eye relief along with eyelenses being over 3/4" diameter. Center focus is great. Only way I can describe it is like the fine tuning on the old base short wave radios. If your used to fast focus binos you'll adore these. Best way to hand hold I've found is one hand all the way out on one barrel. Balance is excellent. I sold my 16x60 Pentax's & bought these because views were a heck of a lot better Overall better bino in my opinion. If you want some long range views with great fov you gotta try 'em. You'll be thrilled for the price
4,I've been using an Orion XT6 for looking at the sky but wanted a pair of binoculars for help spotting the stars and looking at some of the objects that I didn't need a telescope for. Finally decided on these. The first pair I received were defective. A piece of the rubber that coats the binoculars got stuck inside the right eyepiece dead center so I had a black spot right in my view.Returned those and got a perfect replacement. The magnification is really good when I'm not using them for the stars I check out the birds that come to our feeders. The detail you can see with these are great. I don't mind the size and weight and it does come with a tripod adapter though it feels slightly flimsy.I took a star off because of the fact that my first set came defective.
5,Great binoculars!  We have thoroughly enjoyed them! After almost 10 years one small part failed and the company went above and beyond to remedy the problem. Fabulous customer service! You canât go wrong with this product and company!!
5,I got these binoculars for christmas I was very excited to use them. When I unboxed it it had 3 dust caps 2 for the big lenses and 1 for the 2 small lenses. It had a nylon bag a blue cloth for cleaning the lenses an instruction manual and a tripod adapter. So I tried it out and I got the best veiws ever it had nice contrast sharp veiws and a wide feild of view. It weighed about 3 pounds but my hands were not very stable so I tried out the tripod adapter it took ne about 1 min to find were it screws in. When I got it working it was almost as solid as a rock but it kind of wobbled a tiny bit. I was looking through the binoculars I saw many things around the neighborhood like a flag far away mountains kids sleding some radio towers houses and many other things. these binoculars are huge they hve an apeture of 70mm and 15x magnification or just 15x70. These are my best and favorite binoculars I have ever had.
5,I am not an astronomer by any means.  However these binoculars are certainly a good start.  These binoculars are huge which is exactly what I wanted.  The amount of light they gather is amazing.  The first night I had them out I had to put on my sunglasses to look at the full moon.  I mounted them on my cheap camera tripod. Once settled a nice stable view appears.  The view is very sharp when focused correctly.  Out of the box these worked great and are definitely worth the $55.  I agree with some other posters that holding them near the end of the lenses offers a much more stable view.  The case could be better but I didn't buy these for the case.  May get a sturdier tripod mount in the future but the included one will certainly do for now.  What amazes me is how many more stars there are that the naked eye can't see.  I can look at what appears to be a blank spot in the sky and see a whole star field through these binoculars.  Bangarang.
4,A good pair of binoculars for what I paid at the time (around $50). Very sturdy and lens are clear and of high quality. Tripod attachment works well for stabilizing the binoculars for better viewing. The 15X zoom is pretty powerful great for stargazing and looking at the moon. The only thing I found negative about these is that my lenses are not perfectly aligned with each other. It is really noticeable when viewing stars and smaller objects with a high contrast to the background. There will be two images of the object offset from eachother rather than one single object. It can be fixed by removing the rubber grip on the right side of the binoculars and adjusting the screws.
4,Nice bright views of the moon and star clusters. Contrast is good. Optical quality is nothing to sneeze at if you have a solid mount or can make one.  My only real complaints are about balance: the provided tripod adaptor is mostly useless because the bino's balance point is somewhat forward of that provided by the adaptor. It is also flimsy and might as well be thrown away. The real improvements require some simple shop skillsIf you take the time to work out the balance (I had already made a cheap bracket for another pair of binos) adding some lock washers here and there you can expect some very nice viewing through these.
4,I really like the Celestron SkyMaster Giant 15x70 Binoculars.  I've always wanted binoculars that are stronger than the standard 10x50s when looking at the night sky and it looks very good.  My only complaint is to do with the plastic adaptor which attaches the binoculars to my tripod.  It's rather long and if there's a breeze (which there almost always is in the desert) the binoculars wobble so much that I have to tuck a pillow beneath it and the tripod to hold it still.  The adaptor needs to be made out of metal in my opinion.  Otherwise it's very good and I'm very happy.
4,I would give this a 5 if I had not had to replace.  the first one was not properly aligned.  customer service technical support was not very helpful.  sent me an audio recording of how to align a telescope (I have binoculars).  anyway when they sent me a replacement it worked fine.  visibility is very good and it really magnifies.
5,We love these Binoculars. WE took a cross country trip with them and it was perfect. So much easier than lugging around a telescope. Only downside is you really need a good tripod to keep them steady for distant objects like Saturn and Jupiter. But for moon gazing and checking out Andromeda and other sky gazing it's perfect. Great quality too.
4,The binoculars themselves are fantastic.  View is sharp and clear adjustments are easy and the long eye relief is welcome.  The reason for deducting one star is all accessories that come with it are garbage.  The tripod adapter is plastic and wobbles/vibrates with the slightest touch under the weight of these binoculars.  The neck strap is a short 1/4" wide strap with no padding whatsoever.  The bag has very little padding and a cheap fold over Velcro strap to secure it.  I would have gladly paid an extra $15-$20 for some descent accessories or rather they knocked $10 off the price and not include these mostly useless items which I'll be replacing anyway.
5,I strongly agree with the other reviewers that these binoculars are more than worth the price.  Expect to be able to see all the moons of jupiter some moons of saturn and even uranus and neptune even in moderately light-polluted skies.  In many ways these binoculars are closer too a telescope in the views it will provide but still offer the greater field of view and ease of use characteristic of binoculars.  However if you want to see anything other than a bouncing field of stars YOU WILL NEED A TRIPOD.  The weight of these binoculars only adds to the difficulty of holding them steady.  Also while the binoculars are more than worth the price the cheap plastic tripod adapter included is not.  Every time I would touch the binoculars even with my nose I would have to wait 30s just for it stop wobbling.  I strongly suggest purchasing a separate tripod adapter equal to the task. I got this oneÂ   Vanguard BA-168 Binocular Tripod Adapter        Â and it is a significant improvement.  All in all even with the extra $15 for a proper adapter these binoculars are a great deal.
4,I was on the fence about buying these but I figured it was the most bang for my buck. I wanted to use these primarily for star gazing and I knew that I wasn't going to get great detail but these really do make night sky come to life. I couldn't see the "red eye" of Jupiter but it was fun getting a closer look at the planet and seeing stars that I couldn't with the naked eye. I've been using these in the suburbs and I'm curious to see what results I'll get out in the mountains. Overall a great product. Would highly recommend a tripod for it. You can pretty much use any tripod with this adapter just make sure it can support the weight of binoculars. These are also great for day time use as well.
5,Used these in Joshua tree to see the night sky. The moon was very bright and we could see a lot of detail. We mounted it on a tripod so it was stable and because these would get heavy if you had to hold them for a long time.
5,I have had these binoculars for about 1 year now and I still bring them basically anywhere I go. I started to get interested in Astronomy last summer and needed an optical instrument that would be easy to use and not very expensive. I went ahead and ordered SkyMaster and loved it from day 1. They are great for both Astronomy use and for day time observing. From looking at distant landscape contrails of an overhead jet travelling at 35000 feet or looking at Andromeda galaxy these binocs bring everything much closer and much brighter than most people would expect. There is always a WOW factor when someone picks it up for the first time. All moving parts including focuser are smooth and very well made. The only downside that I see is that these are relatively big and heavy binoculars. I would suggest buying a monopod so your viewing sessions will be longer and more enjoyable. If you don't have monopod or tripod just find some kind of support for your arms or sit in the reclining chair. Overall this is top level highly recommended product.
5,These binos came somewhat un-collimated by my estimation.  After reading several other reviews I discovered the screws underneath the handgrips.  Only took me 2 min to adjust one screw and it made a world of difference in the image coming in so crisp these binos will blow you away as long as you can get them leaned against something sturdy or a tripod.  When they are completely still and it is clear outside and DARK you will be amazed.At this price the 15x70s are totally worth it because of how deep you can see into space.A few drawbacks are just pure cosmetic flaws somewhat to be expected with this price as follows: Tripod adapter flimsy however following another reviewers advice I filled the sides with plastic epoxy and reinforced it very well.  Other flaws include flimsy bag but glad it even came with one.Buy these now and start watching the sky I've even seen some things moving around up there I guess I am to believe these are satellites of human origin who knows.
4,Having owned 25x100 binoculars and all the way up to 10" schmidt cassagrain telescopes I have an idea what to expect from bargain priced optics. These binoculars are well worth the price. The view is bright and sharp the weight is low the eye relief is acceptable and the rubberized grip is very nice. They aren't weather sealed $400 but I don't need that. I really like the tripod attachment. The only con is the neck strap is too short and thin I mean for $5 more they could have a nice one. The 15x70 is great for looking at star fields.
5,Everything I was hoping for I use the glasses for searching in the sky for Bald Eagles usually looking out over 3-4 mile distances. With these its not a problem one thing I noticed if your in too close ie. looking a block or two you may see some white ghosts on the outer fringes(bottom) what I noticed was as you scan further out this disappears these things really are for looking LONG DISTANCES. When your scanning everything is very clear. I like the finish on the glasses like rubber which gives you a good grip on them. They are big so I do lean on my truck door etc. after a few minutes trying to keep them up any longer would be a torture test. I did notice some reviews mention them being out of focus I didn't have this problem my guess would be as with any optics if they are hit or bumped you could knock them out of focus I'm usually very careful with optics. The bag was ok for me. All in all for the money you can't beat them very satisfied.
3,These are good for the price.  However I wish that I had saved a little more and gotten a better quality set.Like many others here I have problems with collimation.  It drifts out over time.  It is easy enough to adjust back to the correct alignment but it is still a pain to have to do this.  Also there is some color smearing which is especially noticeable while looking at stars.We bought this because we were not sure whether or not we were in to astronomy enough to justify a more expensive model.  If I was rating it on this alone then it might get a higher rating from me as the price is pretty reasonable.  However because of the drawbacks this unit is pretty much only good for viewing the moon.  To be fair the view of the moon through these binoculars is truly breathtaking.As a side note these things are pretty big.  They are uncomfortable to hold up for more than a minute or two and it is very hard to keep them steady enough to view through.  I did not lower the rating because of this but I would strongly suggest getting a tripod.  We did and are very happy with that decision.
4,These Celestron Skymaster 15x70's are a great way to get close.  I use mine at night for law enforcement and they let in a lot of light.  A coworker has a set of 10x50's and these blow them away.  He keeps asking to use mine.  You get a lot closer and a lot more light.  Looking at stars you will encounter a little shake but a Tri pod helps.  I use mine for work so I do not experience much shake unless I am cold and shake myself.  For the price you can not beat them.  One word of caution......do not drop them or bang them too hard or they will get out of calibration.  Mine took a slight bump so it is costing me 14.95 to send them back to be fixed or replaced.  Desptit that they are great.
5,Prepare to collimate.Very good product great optics quality for the price.Probably the best price per magnification and quality.When the binoculars arrived i had a collimation problem (its not nice to see double stars) that was high enough to worry about. However this binoculars have a very simple and fast collimation regulation through two screws located under the rubber protection on each lens. Just pick a flat screw driver and turn it (1/4 turn a time) to center your images. Right side moves left/right the prism the left side one moves up/down the prism. Took me like 10 mins to fine the prisms and i have a very good center image now.Although you can use them on your hands and get a decent centered image I highly recommend mount them on tripod (adapter included)
5,We had a telescope a few years ago I couldn't use it my daughter couldn't use it- we sent it back. We don't know how to use those things that's true. I was chastised for my review of that telescope and hesitated to ever buy anything like it again until she said she wanted really good binoculars!! Got them with these skymasters. I tried them out when they first came in the mail. I couldn't see anything... it was dark I was at a bad angle and the neighbors garage lights (not attached to any houses-I'm not a weirdo) were not coming in clearly...I was so nervous they wouldn't work. Operator error because on Christmas morning she was scoping out trees found her school through the brush since there are no leaves on the trees and was SO happy. We checked out the moon and loved seeing the craters quite a bit closer. Overall we are very pleased!
4,I just received my pair yesterday walked out to my deck that overlooks a very big valley and spotted many things that I had no idea was even there before. View was very clear and was easy to adjust for clear site even with my bad eyes!!Packaged very good for safe transport to me from Amazon. Has a nice carry case and eye piece covers for me to transport about.The reason I rated this a 4 out of 5 is that I tried them at night looking at the evening sky.....the lights of the city and the stars were quite" jumpy" while hand holding. I will be trying the tri-pod viewing to see if it gets any better.Overall clear easy to use and powerful.A good deal for the money so far.
5,It is exactly what I expected.  The binoculars worked fine and I received everything in the box I was expecting.  The one thing I thought I would dislike wasn't as bad as I expected and that is the weight.  They are heavy about 3 pounds but if you aren't holding them for long they are fine.  You can brace yourself against something to steady the long range view which provides a great focus.  I bought a tripod for the binoculars and they come with an attachment for a tripod and it worked perfect.  The strap is too skinny to be comfortable around your neck for such heavy binoculars but any strap Binocular camera etc) can be used with these.  The long distance viewing is great and I'm happy I bought them for the price.
5,Just starting out in stargazing so got this to view the night sky. I read a lot of reviews about the collimation problem on these but was lucky to receive one which didn't have any issues.The build quality is very good. Also very comfortable to hold. (Tip: hold at wider end to reduce shake).Optics: Very clear! This is my first bino pair so don't have a previous experience to compare it against. But being an amateur photographer I know how much good glass costs. For $55 I'd say the optics are definitely a bang for your buck. The full moon looked gorgeous and the craters looked very sharp. Chromatic aberration was surprisingly low. Expected a little more magnification but perhaps my expectations were mislaid. Excited to view Orion Nebula next (have little/no moon light right now).Summary: Good build surprisingly good optics well worth the $ if you just want to dabble in astronomy or if this is your first binoculars.
5,I believe optics is one of those areas where you really get what you pay for so I was really surprised how good these are. They are very clear and bright across the whole field of view. I really like how full and immersive the view is. I can't get enough of looking at different clusters or the Andromeda galaxy.The only problem with having such huge lenses to capture all that light is that they're a bit unwieldy and it's hard to get a nice and stable view. You can use a tripod but the included adapter isn't very stable and a tripod takes away from the freedom to pan around as you please. My solution was to build a stabilizer frame (google "DIY binocular stabilizer") which really helped get nice clear views while still being able to freely look anywhere.
5,Great optics build quality and tripod mount. Product was just what I was looking for although the box states the tripod mount IS included I had to pay extra for it (???) But the tripod I received is a high quality metal mount the original one that comes in the box with the binos looks like it may be plastic so (I guess) I cant complain. Holding the binos steady is difficult without a tripod and placing the binos on a tripod is hard on your neck when stargazing.
5,Binoculars are working great.  I would have bought them without the mount at this price.Even with tripod and solid mount (not this mount!) there is still some vulnerability to windy conditions.  Even my $200 super heavy duty bomb proof professional tripod had some shake in it after I made a solid steel mount.  Hanging a weight from the tripod center helps.The mount is just plain useless.  At this magnification that flimsy plastic mount just allows tiny disturbances to ruin the binocular performance.  For illustration when I gently tapped the side of the binocs with the tip of my finger the binocs began rotational vibrations about 3/8" magnitude.  The vibrations didn't fully dampen for about 3-5 seconds.  When you get this setup just throw away the mount.I made a mount that works great.  See attached photos.
3,This is the 2nd time I've ordered these - the first time I returned them due to poor collimation.  Looking at stars gave me a double image.  Other than that I loved them so I took a chance and ordered them again hoping that the first set was a fluke.  Bummer!  Same deal - not as bad but still not aligned correctly.  I would try to collimate them myself if I could but there is no help with that either in Celestron's website their "manual" that came with the binoculars or anywhere on the web or on YouTube that could help.  What I have seen on the web is not applicable with these binocs.  I could not "peel back" the rubber handgrips as one person suggested in order to get to set screws.  DO NOT DO THIS!  They are glued on!  I will try to call Celestron to see what they want me to do but I would be happy to adjust the collimation myself if only the process was clear-cut as it has been on other binocs.  For terrestrial viewing these binoculars are great!  I really love them.  But seeing double when looking up is not okay!!
2,TO start I am a HUGE Celestron fan and owner. I have about 10 telescopes from Celestron and Meade from 4" to 11". I wanted a pair of binoculars to grab to run outside with for quick celestial "emergencies" and also to check the general clarity of the sky to see if it's worth hauling out a 300lb big scope rig.I saw the reviews and some were good and some were bad on these binoculars but sense I own a lot of Celestron items i decided to give them a try.To be fair I bought ones that were a customer return so I'm hoping that is the issue and its not a general issue but these things were horrible. The collimation was so far off it almost gave me a headache. Total double image of anything smaller than the moon. I actually wanted to keep them even with this issue but it was jsut so bad looking at Saturn for instance made almost an "M" image. I would have given them 1-2 stars but sense a lot of people gave them 5 and they were customer returns I'm sure some good sets are out there and i just got a bad pair.My opinion is DONT buy any from warehouse deals. Get a new pair and hopefully have better luck than myself.Sorry you cant get photos of collimation issues as you need two images at the same time or i would have posted photos
5,Honestly you're not going to find a better set of binoculars with these specs for under a few hundred dollars. I have both Nikons and Swarovskis and while their quality is significant so is their price. Most people will find these Celestrons adequate barring use in harsh environments or situations necessitating durability. They are surprisingly light for their size (in a cheap way) but I was really impressed with the clarity of the image especially during the day. The lenses alone are well worth the price of admission. They're perfect for low budget terrestrial use (weather permitting) and astronomy. They come with a tripod adapter (which you will need for image stabilization unless you have hands of steel) lens covers and carry case. The eyepiece cover is a single unit that covers both eyepieces but the objective lenses have individual covers. Please note that the covers are flimsy and tend to fall off easily but again you're only paying about $60.
4,From the moment you open the box you realize this is the real thing and not a cheap version of binoculars. I have retired my old ones. Then wait until is dark and watch the moon with them to discover a moon you had not seen before....plenty of details with shades and craters that you can promenade and enjoy your view around. Do not get me wrong this is not a telescope but decent binoculars.Another feature I liked is that although my eyes are quite close to each other the folding range was not limiting as I had experienced with frustration with other binoculars.  So yes I can happily recommend these binoculars.
5,I have been to a couple of stargazing parties with these and its funny how many people with their big scopes come over wanting to look through the binoculars.  Quality seems to be excellent but thats from a newbie to astronomy.  I love looking thru them but havent quite mastered the best way to use them yet as i wear glasses.  I have just got a tripod and hope that helps because the biggest problem is holding them steady enough.  but based on all the comments at the stargazing party these are an amazing value and great for those just getting into astronomy and trying to learn the night sky before making a big investment in a telescope .  I enjoy looking through the scopes but actually like looking thru the binoculars more so far.  But as i said im still learning and do want to eventually get a nice scope.  For those just starting out though I think this is a very good binocular and am looking forward to some clear skies and using them.
5,These are fantastic right out of the box. Very light weight and easy to use. The other reviews are wrong and no tripod needed unless you want to take pictures. The optics are spot on and these are ready to use right out of the box. Highly recommended as simple substitute for a telescope. Great also for viewing nature as well.
5,Really worth the money I love these. I bought the smaller version a month before which worked great just not enough zoom. These ones have exceeded my expectations!  I am new to astronomy and I believe these are great for any beginners. Would suggest buying a tripod with them.
4,Just like most of the reviews here i agree that these binoculars are great quality especially for the price. And will satisfy the seasoned amateur astronomer and amaze all but the pickiest of newcomers.The only negative so far is the poor tripod adapter. It broke after fitting it for the first time.Although not negatives there are other things to keep in mind: these are heavy and there is some chromatic aberration  (rainbow colours on the  edges of the images). These are expected tradeoffs for binoculars this size and price.Recommended as a second or 3rd pair for those looking for more magification and better light gathering ability.
5,If you have shaky hands then you will have trouble holding them still.They are twice the size of 8x56 binoculars.The viewing capabilities are amazing you can view things 50ft away or focus in on the moon or stars. Very good all around. Just hard to hold still. Nothing a tripod wouldn't fix
4,Loved the viewing itâs just hard to hold it still but I did but the tripod but to no avail ! I guess I need to find a better tripodI have to dT though the moon looks amazing you can see the large craters jutting out of the sides and the Orion Nebula takes your breath away
5,After reading some great reviews on this particular pair of binoculars I decided to purchase them from Amazon.  I got these for basic stargazing and did not expect them to work as well as they did.  Looking at the moon was amazing.  You are able to clearly see the moon and all of its impact craters.  These past few months into 2015 I have been able to view Jupiter and 4 of its moons clearly.  I can see the Orion Nebula and surrounding stars beautifully.  Surprisingly on a very clear night I was able to view the Andromeda Galaxy.  The galaxy was not clear but you could see the brightest center section of it.  I am located in a pretty lit area but no where near a big city.  These are a wonderful pair of beginner binoculars or even for someone who has been stargazing for years.
5,I'm an amateur astronomer of about 6 years and I can say that these are a top notch pair of binoculars! (Some of the best I've ever looked through for this price). You can't go wrong for the price especially if you're trying to view the night sky. I use a bogen tripod and monopod to view with though since these are kind of heavy. I have seen countless beautiful clusters nebulas (little harder) galaxies and double stars; along with Jupiter and all 4 of its largest moons. The moon is amazing in these bincos too. I insist that if you're looking for a pair to get started with and learn the night sky these are them. Celestron makes nice telescopes and most certainly binoculars too. Also many don't mention this on here but Celestron has a no fault limited lifetime warranty. The limited part only means that if you break it in the first 30 days they fix for free but after its $25 and they'll give you a new pair if needed. Now that's customer service!
5,I am very happy with these binoculars! The first night in a city of pretty high pollution I was able to see so many more stars than those visible by the naked eye. Other objects were clearly visible and clear with these. I wear glasses so I appreciated the ability to fold the rubber eye caps for a better view; however I'd prefer to wear contacts or not use glasses at all because of the light entering the sides of my glasses as I attempt to get a view through the binoculars. The Celestrons are pretty easy to adjust and come with a pretty nice carry-on bag. The only thing I noticed was that the tripod adjuster piece where the screw adjusts was made of pretty cheap plastic. The plastic top portion of the screw cracked when I tried connecting it to my tripod. I will attempt to get this replaced by Celestron.
4,The binoculars themselves are great but they are astronomy binos and you need to use a mounting bracket to tripod mount them for stabilizing them. I knew this before I purchased them. I am only giving them four stars though because the tripod mounting bracket that comes with them is garbage. The slightest breeze or lightest  touch and they become impossible to see anything through. I have other pairs with metal mounts and have no problems with them. If these had a quality mount or Celstron didn't offer any mount with them at all I would give a five star rating but because of the inferior mount they loose a star.
5,Think you have a steady hand?  These will prove you wrong!  As with any large binoculars these are difficult to hold steady for wildlife or astronomical observing. Add a nice tripod. Great optics for the value.
4,Good inexpensive binoculars. No problem using it.
3,I would actually give them a 3 1/2 I decided to return them. I am looking into getting one of their telescopes because that may better suit my purpose. I got the binocs because I like portability unfortunately these are hard to stabilize for far off things. The focal wheel is very sensitive and it seems as thought the moon is about half way through the focus range and extremely sensitive so I never could get a clear constant view. I have a slight astigmatism so one of my eyes was always off. I tried putting the binocs on one of my tripods (the one for my Nikon F2) and it didn't work very well as it wobbled and it couldn't get stable perhaps a better tripod but then a telescope is a better option. These worked extremely well at night in the city as I could see just as clear as just looking out in the street. I think they would work great for football games but I already have a good pair of Bushnells for that.
3,Great optics let down by poor quality control and cheap tripod adapter.The Binoculars are very heavy with good optics. But the magnification is high and with that it is almost impossible to hold it steady. Also without any easy finder it was hard to narrow down region of sky. Maybe I could have mastered that with some practice.Anyway I mounted it on a tripod as many reviewers recommended. Once the wobble of tripod adapter stopped I looked through the telescope and saw double stars. Collimation was slightly off. I did not want to take a chance messing with it even though on Google there are several sites that will tell you how to do that.Looking at zenith was impossible with tripod as I had to bend my neck at 90 degree. Without tripod I had to sleep on the ground but could not hold it steady. The only plus side was daylight viewing was pleasant where you do not have to raise to binoculars more than 40 deg and are looking a bigger object such as buildings or birds.I ended up returning it and now looking for rich field telescope with easy finder around 400 mm focal length.
4,I've read a lot of positive reviews about these. And I agree they are a great value. I won't try to change anyone's mind. They work well. I have have just a few low cost binoculars with really impressive optics. Most all binoculars I've ever bought were 100.00 or less sometimes way less and many had really bad optics to me at least the non pro. But with enough searches I've actually found some with awesome optics. While the ones I found that had awesome optics were not for astronomy. They were $40 8x42 my point is this... It is possible to make low cost binoculars with great optics. I wish these optics could be considered great but I think they are just good.
5,I bought these for my husband for Christmas.  I have to say wow.  You get a lot of bang for your buck.  We live on the Indian river in FL and like to be able to look at the dolphins manatee birds boats on the river and these really bring things up close.  We love them. I researched a lot and even bought a more expensive pair that I sent back you really need the higher power to see better and these give you all that and more.  For the price these are Great.  These are a bit heavy and I need to lean against something (i.e  door jam) to hold them steady for a long period of time. The bigger downside is that they are made in China. As an American that lives in a country that has such high unemployment it gripes me to buy things from China.  Neither of these downsides take away from the fact that they work great.
3,You can't get a better one at this price range though it comes with flawsIt does need collimation and it's not the easiest thing to do.The ergonomics is also not it's forte. I would hope its shape could guide me to hold its center of gravity.Focus knob feels soft and has a great amount of backlash. Not critical but might get annoying.The optics are just so so. You could get a good 75% center area free of chromatic aberration. After that color fringes would appear and views get blurry.The advertised "long eye relief" isn't really justified. If you can use it without glass then do it. You lose a lot of "field of view" with your glass on.Bottom line: you would mount it to a tripod to use it and the one comes with it DOES NOT hold it steady.
5,These are the largest Binoculars I own I have a few I live near some mountains and fist thing I did was peer at the closest one to me and I thought at first that these were not as powerful or any better than my old pair my bad I thought I was looking at the closest mountain until I realized I was focused on the farthest mountain 10 miles away and I could see people hiking up there!! when I looked at the same mountain I couldn't even see the trails let alone people so yea these are as described powerful nicely built heavy duty these are large no doubt I ordered a tripod same day as I realized they are so powerful it needs a base to sit on so it will be a steady view cuz at long distances any slight movement is noticeable of course. I like my purchase and for the money I don't know how you could go wrong. AAAAA+++
4,Optically it seems to have decent quality for the price.I have noticed that many other reviewers giving good ratings on optics.However regarding the tripod adaptor there seems to be some problem.First of all female thread(1/4-20)location on the binocular was not balanced; front objective lens side is way too heavy compare to eyepiece side; the location of the female thread should be moved to more balancing point.2nd the material for both male & female thread is aluminum; it should be made of steel considering the rather heavy(3-5 pound)one for binocular. It already showed wear on alum thread just after a few usage.I find the tripod adaptor was flimsy and inadequate; it does not provide solid sturdy or secure holding on binocular. It need to be improved.But overall with relatively good optics it's not too bad for the price.Isaac
5,Well first of all I'm a beginner astronomer so my review is based on my hands on experience with  the product and on the comparison between my previous binoculars (Polaroid 12 x 50) and these Celestron 15x70. That said I can affirm that those binos really surprised me especially considering the affordable price. The image is sharp the field of view very good and the focus very easy to achieve. I've read some negative reviews but my experience with these binoculars has been great since opening the box; in less that 10 min I was watching the beautiful Double Star of Beta Lyrae much sharper than before. The only downsize - if so - is that these are not portable binoculars. You really need a good tripod to avoid jitters.
5,I owned a 8" schmitt and a 102mm mustav. After a time I sold them both. Coupled with a tripod these "Giants" provide easier viewing of night sky and daylight terra views. Ease of set-up portability and other factors make binos a great alternative you may end up using more often and for longer periods. Living in Maui with available dark clear skies offers larger vistas of the milkyway even in winter. I can get a big view of already familiar skies.One negative...just to be realistic. Binos on a camera tripod though convenient for terra views are difficult to view overhead objects due to mechanical design constraints. The closer sky objects are to the horizon the easier the head-tilt angle.It makes sense why astro teles and binos have 90-45 degree eye pieces.Nevertheless I anticipate I'll use these not only for myself but to show friends the sky and the earth more than I ever did before.
5,I have been an amateur astronomer for over 25 years. I am frequently traveling across my state to visit with my father-in-law who is also an amateur astronomer and the need for portability is a must. These binoculars not only offer great views of the sky but are easy to pack on-the-go while traveling. With the included tripod adapter I can adapt it to a camera tripod for more stable viewing. The best thing to do is to search the Internet for plans on building a binocular tripod which I have done over Christmas 2011 with simple wood parts from Lowe's. This way I don't have to strain my neck while viewing. No the binocs will never replace my Newtownian Reflector or my Schmidt-Cassegrain or show me detailed views of Jupiter's cloud bands like in an 8" scope but they're too big to lug around or motivate myself to pack on long trips. These are just perfect for me anyway!
5,I bought a pair of these last year from Amazon and they have done a great job.  They are a little heavy as you would expect with something this large.They have been in the back seat of my car for six months with my 6 year old climbing on them and they still are just as good as new. I suggest buying a hard plastic pistol case to keep them in the bag they come in isn't the best at protecting them but what do you want for this price?If you are just starting out in astronomy and want some good binoculars for birding and looking up at the night sky then these are what you want. Remember anybody can shell out $800 on a pair of binoculars and pretend that all else is inferior if you are so inclined then  these are not for you. However the rest of us can buy these binos and use the cash we saved to travel to some dark sky areas of the country.
5,I only recently developed an interest in astronomy and after some research decided to invest in a pair of high quality binoculars rather than a telescope to start out with. These binoculars are a fantastic beginner tool for anyone interested in astronomy and stargazing. Features of the moon look crisp and clear and deep sky objects such as the Orion Nebula Andromeda Galaxy and the Pleiades are all fascinating to see with enhanced brightness and clarity. They are slightly heavier than other binoculars I've used in the past but this was to be expected and I don't find the weight to be a burden at all. For my purposes these binoculars do a fantastic job for the price paid. I couldn't be more pleased with these!
2,I use these for whale watching which I do from high promontories along the coastline. Since searching for whales takes an extended amount of time you need to be patient and I use mine on a monopod which carries the weight and helps to reduce the amount of jitter. I purchased the metal Celestron binocular adapter rather then mess with the allegedly flexible one supplied with the binoculars. While clearly larger than 10x50 binoculars I don't find the increased size a big deal at all. Because I use mine with a monopod the neck strap width is a non-issue too.The binoculars focus smoothly and I thought that this aspect was much better than other binoculars I have. The 70mm objective lenses provide a nice bright image. Eye relief is good and these binoculars are comfortable to use.The down side. I have read many of the reviews here and users have said that collimation was a perennial issue. However the first thing I noticed with mine was chromatic aberration (CA). I had only heard about this and never experienced it. But with these binoculars it was extremely obvious. At first I thought it was a focussing limitation and then I realised that all bright objects that were off axis had magenta fringing around them. When looking at the horizon if I lower the binoculars so that the horizon is high in the viewing circle the interface between the ocean and the sky has a significant magenta line just above the horizon. Yuk. Still they were only US$70 or so.
5,After comparing these to 10x50's and reading all the reviews we decided to get these and all I can say is "WOW"!  We had a crystal clear night the day these came in so naturally we headed outdoors and couldn't believe what we were seeing....the moons of Jupiter!  Spotted Saturn too and could just barely make out the rings.  I think a tripod would make planet viewing incredible since it's hard to keep the binocs complety steady when looking into deep space.  These have opened up a whole new world on our daytime nature walks as well have spotted turtles and beavers clear across a lake.  And I can't even get into bird watching!  You can see every detail on birds.  It seemed like we were looking at birds on a high def screen.  These are WELL worth the money!  You will NOT be disappointed :)
5,Had no collimation issues with our set. I know others get unlucky with this but it looks like ours was shipped professionally. The 15x really opens up a lot of stars at night. Not too hard to find individual stars at night but you will need to stabilize your arms or use a tripod. I can't imagine using the 25x by hand. Glad we got the 15x.
4,Great Binoculars.  The easily show the Galilean moons of Jupiter.  But you'll need a tripod.
5,I love these binoculars!  They are gimongous!  Great price and great optics.  I managed to catch a retreating pack of coyotes up on the hill (in broad daylight!) a red-tailed hawk in a sublime glide spree and capture the details of a U.S. Army CH-47 Chinook helicopter criss-crossing the sky!  I cannot wait to check out the fall sky tonight!  I also got the tripod but I have not tried it out yet.  My only complaints are:  a.) the flimsy holding strap--which it is great for a tiny pocket-type binoculars; b.) in the same vein the carrying case is kind of lame--made of the same material used to make insulated lunch bags.  These binoculars deserve a sturdier (hard-plastic) case than these over-sized lunch bag! But otherwise a great investment.  Very please.
5,I purchased these for star gazing and am really impressed. I am able to see many star clusters M42/43 Orion Nebula Jupiter's moons just to name a few. They are heavy but not to heavy. I purchased a recommended tripod but I am sending it back as it's not stable enough for these babies (go heave duty). My astro club suggested I get these before moving into a large dob scope and I am glad I did!!! I had no idea you could see so much through a good pair of binoculars and I am having a blast learning the night sky. Get a sky atlas or download the latest skymap and get out there. I bought these on sale here for $48 and these binoculars do not disappoint! Awesome product awesome transaction through Amazon fast shipping.PS:Don't forget a lens pen or other cleaning kit. Celestron makes one but their brand and other knock offs can be found cheaper elsewhere on the net with minimal searching.
4,Pros:- BAK4 prism provides crisp and clear images- tripod adaptable- huge objectives- does what is it supposed to do- water-resistantCons:- Heavy but this isn't one of the binoculars you'd bring to a stadium or for hiking- Needs tripod for image stability; comes with tripod adapter so this issue is null- Neck strap is pretty much non-usable since the weight of binoculars actually put pressure on the back of your neck. You would use a tripod most of the time so this is also null- Crappy carrying bag with strap but nonetheless a bagThe relative:- If you get this make sure you have a sturdy tripodNote- I was able to make out the shape of Jupiter and see several of its moon with no difficulty.
5,I am glad i went ahead and bought these binoculars.  They are everything they claim to be. You really can see the rings of saturnwhat a treat. If your on the fence go ahead and treat yourself you wont be disappointed.  Only thing you may want is an even stronger pairbut for the best bang for buck these are the ones.
5,Great especially for price. Easy diy trial and error collimating. I don't know why people tear off the right grip. I just cut a little piece off the right grip for the horizontal and vertical adjustment screws with the tiny scissors on my Swiss army keychain knife. Do yourself a favour and spend $3 on a tiny long flathead screwdriver.Vertical prism adjustment screw is under the right grip inside the center towards the front. The horizontal prism adjustment screw is just below the 0 in "15x70" marking.Also measure the distance between the center of your pupils so you can better adjust the binocular's IDP (interpupilary distance). Just match it up to the distance between the centres of the eye holes on binoculars.
4,I'm really happy with these binoculars for both terrestrial and celestial viewing.  I wanted something that my family could quickly grab and easily look at the stars and constellations. To me they seem really powerful.  Orion has been my favorite constellation since 5th grade and one of the first star formations I viewed. I was in awe at the sites I saw in his belt. It looked like a door to heaven was open with light following out.  Seeing that alone was worth every penny.  The only reason I give it 4 stars is to let others know that in some cases a tripod would be beneficial.  Other than that the binoculars by itself is fantastic.
4,Great product
4,Pretty good for amateur âstar gazing.â Very heavy and cumbersome though. Not good for those with arthritis in hands or neck.
5,En general se ve en muy buenas condiciones lo que falta por evaluar el la prueba de campo en observaciones diurnas respondiÃ³ excelente estoy en la espera de un tripode para poder apreciar mejor los objetivos pero en general muy satisfecho con la compra
5,The binoculars came well packaged and ready to use. No problems it was a moonless night and right away I spotted something in orbit moving very fast a satellite or something. Then I saw a jet airliner and I could actually see the shape of the jet it sure seemed close even though it was very high. The Milky Way was clear and crisp too many stars it kinda scared me. I don't think one would be able to see the rings of Saturn but it sure is entertaining. The land views are also great I was able to read the plates on my neighbors RV and close to 400 meters. The tripod attachment wobbled in the wind and that was the only problem if that. Good buy.
3,These are great if all you want to do is look at the Moon. Or across the street into your neighbor's yard. They make the stars go from tiny white lights in the sky to slightly less tiny white lights in the sky. They aren't particularly practical to take anywhere due to the size of them- although they aren't heavy they are awkward so you do need a tripod because as you hold them you move slightly whether you're aware of it or not and it does blur whatever you are viewing. I could see more stars with them than with my naked eye but again they looked just like the stars when you look up at them. I got them for celestial viewing due to the pics provided in comments and have not seen anything that impresses me enough to keep them. I can't use when birdwatching or sightseeing due to the sheer bulk so back they are going.
4,Great scope but a bit on the heavy side. I was somewhat prepared for the weight but i didn't realize just how heavy it is until i got it focused on a star and realize i can't hold it steady because of the weight. A tripod therefore is a must.The scope arrived poorly collimated... However thanks to google and a bunch of enthusiast they posted how to collimate the scope. It was easily done and completed in less than 10 minutes.Well built construction good complete rubber coating. Visually havn't tested it fully yet but I believe its great. The magnified image is at most equivalent to a 25mm eye piece on a f10 scope.
5,These are great for birding.  I use them every time I go out.  My kids originally laughed when they saw them because they are very large binoculars.  You will not be a secret agent with these around your neck.  The first weekend I had them we went skiing and I was able to see the skiers faces at the top of the lift from the lodge at the base.  I honestly cannot rave enough about these.  They carry a lifetime warranty and are well under a hundred dollars.  I don't know how you can go wrong with these.  When we use them to watch the stars comets satellites and the moon we use a tripod which helps them to remain very steady.  These do come with the arm to attach to a tripod which is nice that I did not have to purchase anything else.
5,I bought these for my husband and he was like a kid in the candy store smiling from ear to ear when he first got them. He said they have a lil weight to them. He waned something to do with the kids outside so now they can go and enjoy the outdoors.
5,The Celestion 15x70s combined with the 'Amazon Choice' tripod totals under $100 USD. With solid focus clear image and a really fantastic field of view these are probably *better* than a telescope for most nightime skywatchings (very easy to aim) and they are great for urban uses as well. The soft caps are barely adequate but you get a bag cloth and adapter and strap. Try viewing a full moon through these and not be impressed.Durability and how the optics fare over time will have to be determined as these are big and heavy and are probably more fragile than they 'feel'. Recommended.
5,Great binoculars especially for the price.  Wanted some 10x70's for many many years but just couldn't spend the money.  Prices have dropped significantly in recent years and I took a chance on these... glad I did.  My friends and family were amazed at how well these worked and how easy they are to use.  They were even more amazed when I told them what I paid for them.  Only downside is size and weight so they are not something I would carry much in the field unless I needed lots of distance spotting for the day.  But I got them more for looking around the property surrounding my house anyway so they are perfect for that.
5,Amazing optics. Not crazy about how it mounts on a tripod.  Always worried it is going to misalign the lenses or simply break.  But donât get me wrong.  I would by these again.  Worth the money.
3,My celestron skymaster 15x70 bins were out of collimation when I received them. I dont think it was due to shipping either like some said because the double vision looked to be horizontally equal (lookin at one star at night on a tripod). After checking the 1 star reviews another user made the same adjustment I did (1/4 turn clockwise on both screws..made in small increments of course) and they are fine now. This site is for oberwerk but it works for celestron also http://www.oberwerk.com/support/collimate.htm. You'll need a small jewelers screwdriver. Its a phillips head screw but I used a flat head to get it done.Also the tripod adapter is rather flimsy with a side to side wiggle. I guess they want to sell their metal one (Celestron 93524 Binocular Tripod Adapter) which I may consider buying.Overall I gave it a 3 star rating because I dont mind making my own adjustments and at least I know how to adjust them in case it happens again and for the plastic wiggley tripod adapter.
5,I have used the Celestron SkyMaster for celestial and terrestrial viewing and have found them quite good for both.  The large objective lenses absorb enough light to bring in deep sky objects despite the rectifying prisms needed for most ground viewing.For viewing animal life in forests and fields the binocular is exceptionally good. For instance for the past three years we have had Great Horned Owls nesting in a tree in the forest which is the back of our home; with a 10x50 binocular the view was fascinating--but the 15x70 practically puts us in the nest.A tripod is an advantage with these binoculars since they tremble in one's hands at that power and you probably don't want them for stomping through the wilderness--that's when a simple 8x35 or a small zoom scope works well.However in the right place and for the right use I've seen nothing better for the price.Bob SauerbreySE Indiana
5,If you're seeing in double through your binoculars note this:Both of the giant scopes *screw into* the housing of the binoculars.  They're not screwed in very tightly at the factory.  When you go to adjust the width of the eye pieces you're torquing the scopes with your hands to rotate the width adjustment.  You may be inadvertantly unscrewing one or both of the scopes from the housing ever-so-slightly in the process.  I've had double vision on two separate occasions from this happening.It's a very easy fix - simply screw both scopes back on as tightly as you possibly can and then the double vision goes away.  Enjoy your stellar crisp single binocular vision!
5,I had originally check these and put them in the cart. I changed my mind and wanted a smaller size but evidently I didn't get these removed.They are great glasses and I like them but they are huge. My wife has a problem with holding them.  They do come with the attachment for a tripod so that is good.They are well worth the price just be aware of the size when ordering.
5,Boy for the money hard to beat. They work great and are very sharp. No collimation issues at all only one sharp and bright object. Really nice rubber coating aiding grip and weatherization. One thing to note is the neck strap is a real joke. It is literally so bad I threw it away. Also I tried the tripod supports and can't really make a judgement on them yet but when I first tried I felt they were pretty wobbly but I'll try again and maybe try to tighten up a little more. The binoculars though I'm really glad I bought and I highly recommend them.
5,These binoculars give a very impressive picture especially considering the price.  Can clearly make out craters and details on the moon I never expected with a pair of binoculars.  View of the moon was bright and crisp.  For the price these can't be beat they outperform many large binoculars costing over twice as much with the same specs.  They are large so not something you just want to carry around anywhere for any period of time they came with mounts for a tripod which is a good thing for comfort and viewing smaller objects.
3,Amazon had the best price on these when I bought them and then it got better. Amazing how good cheap Chinese optics can be. You can get much better binoculars but not for this price. My pair was at least "conditionally aligned" so I didn't fuss with the collimation adjustment. These are quite usable as high power terrestrial binoculars if you brace your elbows or just take a quick peek. The major downside is usability without a mount for astronomy or extended terrestrial viewing. A decent mount is going to run at least 3 times what these cost. Your cheap photo tripod won't work. You either need a heavy pro photo tripod or a surveyor's tripod with some kind of head or mount. The included plastic mounting bracket is pretty worthless as well.If you already have something to mount them they are a great value if you want to try out and play with this kind of binocular. If you are planning serious extended use and need a mount you may as well spring for something better. If the price is within your impulse buy toy range go ahead. There is a world of difference between cheap 35mm and these 70mm binos.
4,Warning: don't use it to see the sun till 10 mintues within sunset/sunrise. A brighter sun can burn your eyes and make your blind!I used this to view sunset from my apartment. It was amazing!!! I even took pictures through the binocular with my iphone and uploaded it to my facebook! The sun looks 200 times brigter and bigger in the binocular. Also you can see people 1000 feet away as if they're talking with you. The only disappointment is that I still can not see stars clearly and see the surface of other planets in our solar system. But be realistic: you are using a $70 binocular not a $70-Million Habor telescope!
3,We store our binoculars indoors inside their carrier bag and never really take them anywhere besides our backyard. Minimally handled and they see little if no abuse. These slowly got worse and worse in collimation now use them like a telescope thru one side. I am not confident in realigning but may try it which involves dismantling.
4,These binoculars are very good and sturdy and enable you to see stars and planets in the night sky.  However they are really really heavy and cumbersome!We really enjoyed them on our camping trips and other travels but since a traveler normally prefers to pack lightly these binoculars make that rather difficult.Oh we will still take these along with us on our camping trips and whatnot I just felt I should let others know  that the picture here is rather misleading since they are much much larger than they appear to be.
3,I bought these because I wanted some binocs with big aperture and high power.  They are ok.  If they were fully multi coated the stars would be sharper.  I can  definitely see a difference between these and the fully multi coated ones that I bought at the same time.  I don't really like the eye relief rubber rings.  Seems that I have to practically touch my eye ball to the eye piece to block out surrounding light. They are pretty big and using a tripod for Astro use is required.  Make sure you have a high quality ball mount and tripod or it will be a pain in the butt.  They let lots of light in and allow you to see a lot but it's not as sharp as the fully multi coated binocs.  They might be better for terrestrial daytime use.  The carry case is kinda cheap.  Ok for the price.
4,I just bought these to look at the sky and land I tried a couple different telescopes from about 120.00  190.00 and I never really saw much more from them then my 7x35 bushnell binoculars even with a 2 barlow leans so I gave up on them and I'm trying these. I considered the 20x80 but the reviews brought me to these with the amazon tripod. I think these will easy to handle compared to the large telescopes and the field of view is much better. Should be here soon.
5,You can usually tell when SOME things are quality by the weight of them. In the case of these binoculars...weight here means just that. :) I don't own a scale but I can tell that these scopes weigh about a good 20 lbs. They advertise that these can be used with a tripod...They should be unless you're just taking brief glimpses of the scenery. :) With that said these things are quite powerful...The zoom is really quite good. I can easily spot details on things that are a good two blocks away. I've not had the chance to do any night viewing of the stars planets and moons....Which these are also designed for...And I have no doubt about my amazement when I do. :) Best quality binoculars for the price.....Get them now while they're available!! :)
4,This item is one of the most powerful and well made Binoculars at this range of price. Its clarity is absolutely satisfying for its value. You probably need a Tripod for it though because its kind of heavy for holding steady while watching far objects (your image shakes) with regard to its magnification.I got a used one at first. But it was out of collimation and I ordered a new one to compare it with. The new one worked pretty good so I kept it and returned the used one. It's been months that I'm using this Binoculars and I'm very happy with it. It is hard to carry it around on the shoulder because of its weight. But its magnification strength compensates its bulky body and heavy weight for me.
4,So far I've only used it for terrestrial viewing but it's got excellent optics and it's not that heavy so you  won't need a tripod most of the time.I'll put it through some astronomical tests soon- the ratings for that were very high from other users.Don't make a mistake and try to save a few bucks by buying an off-brand with great specs on paper- usually the construction is cheap and so are the optics. Avoid zoom binoculars- NONE of them are any good even the Celestrons.
5,A great product that has so many viewing options!  A point to remember is the focal point: you cannot focus clearly on anything under about 45 feet. Also I use a tripod for almost all of my viewing whether looking at birds or gazing at the moon. They weigh about three pounds so the tripod is a must for me. They have been one of the best purchases I have made in the toy department.  I am actually learning what time of year I can see the Andromeda Galaxy and the Great Square of Pegasus! In my opinion the tripod is a must and remembering your closet focal point.
2,Update: 2nd pair couldn't be collimated either. Was worse than the first.  I'm done with Skymaster binocs.Amazing price for the specs  but not without quality issues.  Mine were very uncomfortable to look through and once I got them on a steady tripod in daylight I realized why.  They were collimated to the very extremes of adjustment so that 1/2 of the field of view is out of focus.  When looking at the eyepieces from 1' away  you could see they were cut down to football shapes.  I tried for several hours to collimate correctly.  I either can get a 100% field of view in clear focus.  Or I can get them collimated with half in focus/half out of focus & that requires the scews to backed completely off (which leaves the prisms loose and very prone to going out of adjustment).Sent back for an exchange.  Hopefully I'll eventually get a good set. When adjusted individually  each side had a beautiful picture with little abberation. From what I've read  these are very prone to collimation issues.  If they only needed periodic adjustment I'd give them 4 stars but these were so far out of alignment that my first pair was useless.
4,I have owned these for almost a year now.  Being new to astronomy they took some getting used to.  Finding a dark sky area is critical if you can you can easily see globular clusters nebulae and star clusters.  Very good clarity.  I admit they are heavy and learned not to hold them on the body but at the end of the barrels.  Greatly improves stability.  I have a tripod but seldom use it after I figured that one out.  Recently I built solar filters (film + 3D printed housing) and can see sunspots.
5,feels very durable and built well. the strap and lens covers it come with will have to be upgraded however.for those who donât know this is a very large set of Binoculars.
3,Edit - So after digging online I found some instructions on how to rip off the rubber hand grip and perform collimation on the binos.  It was a decently technical process that could easily be done incorrectly and given how easily they lose collimation I have to basically keep the rubber hand grip removed from the binos which makes them look less than stellar but at least they work now.  The need much better communication up front on the type of maintenance these need and with how gingerly they must be handled to minimize the loss of collimation that seems to plague these.Worked initially but within 2 weeks they lost colimation (the image from each eye is off and don't line up) now you can't focus on anything.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I should have read the reviews as a lot of other people also have this same problem.
4,I don't pretend to be an expert on optics nor have I gazed through dozens of makes and models but these have met my expectations. Easily able to spot Messier objects in the night sky and being of quality material and workmanship I am quite pleased with my purchase of the Celestron SkyMaster... especially at the very reasonable price of $65. I 'would' recommend acquiring a tripod stand to accompany the included tripod adapter.  As with all binoculars one tends to tremble after holding them up for a bit and as these are bit heavier than the smaller more common binoculars trembling becomes a factor in less time.
2,okay  Got into binos a few years ago have since collected nikon 8x42&10x42 monarchs pentax wp 10x50 nikon 12x50ex and the stardard 7x50 nikon  the monster heavy 25x100 skymaster ( too heavy for my orion heavy duty paralellagram mount) and these that i thought would never let me down until this evening.. the celestron skymaster 15x70s have been my favorite star binos of all these ( close second are my extreme nikon 12x50s.Let me remind first i take care of all my binos. But just minutes ago out of their soft case looking to jupiter I could not seem to get them focused on the left side..so after bringing them inside from the nightsky in my backyard for a closer inspection i noticed the left arm cast somehow broke off the center pin. What a bummer! anyway I remembered the no fault warranty but after only a year these things cracked where you could imagine they would have under normal operation of this instrument.I guess they priced this so cheaply in comparison to other name brands such as the oberwerks or other high end binos 15x70s? I might even suspect the $25.00 fee needed for their no fault warranty was enigeered inside the price? I should hope not but that is why i felt the need to write this review. Celestron should maybe consider hardshell cases instead of soft packs knowing the defect in engineering for these binos.. the aluminum arm casting connection the left diopter snapped off the center focuser and you would imagine on such a crucial area of the mechanics could have been better built(engineered) pair of binoculars. I will call them in the morning 1-800 asp!
5,Terrific binocs for the price!I have a pair of Bushnell Sportsmen 10x42 for a quick look at things. But when I want to "get serious" I pull out the SkyMaster 15x70!You will look like Bugs Bunny getting out cartoon binocs due to the size but they work AND HOW!As others have said a bit on the heavy side but I don't have any problem holding them for 5-10 minutes. Longer than that you will learn to adapt. Sit down prop your elbows on your knees. Lie on your back and look at the stars. Get a tripod whatever works for you.Celestron "No Fault Limited Warranty" means no questions asked repair or replace a good thing for klutzy people!Only accessory I would add is a Pelican case for storage and hauling around in the car. The cheap included carry case does nothing to protect the binoculars from rough handling and binocs this big are more sensitive and need the protection.
3,As others recommend these should definitely be used with a tripod otherwise it's too hard to hold them stable enough to get a view without the image dancing around like crazy. I also found these difficult to focus when looking at stars.I used these one evening and decided they would be useless for my purposes--I want something handheld that I can use for backyard astronomy as well as general terrestrial viewing. For magnification beyond 10x or 12x for astronomy I can see that a telescope might be a good investment for me.Other than that the binoculars themselves seem well-made. However the strap is thin and flimsy and the case may not provide much protection. For the price these are a good value for something this size and magnification--if you can use them. I give them 3 stars (OK) because I think they are of limited use for many people. I have returned these and I'm looking at the Nikon Action binoculars either 10x50 or 12x50. A local camera store carries the Nikons and I will visit and try before making a decision.
3,You can see objects that are very far away with these binoculars. However don't be mislead by the company's advertised no-fault free return/repair policy. I received these binoculars in defective condition. The right diopter was broken and the calibration was off. I noticed the defects the first time I used the binoculars which was a few months after I purchased them. The reason for the delay was that the trip for which they were purchased was delayed due to a death in our family. Otherwise I would have discovered the defects within a couple weeks. Celestron charged me a $25 fee for this repair and make me pay another $12.75 to ship the binoculars back to them. Even though I wrote them a letter describing in detail the reason I was not able to discover the defects sooner they refused to waive the fee because they said I had taken too long to notify them of the problem. So now instead of paying $70 for these binoculars I've spent $108 for them. For that price I could have bought a better quality product. Make no mistake there is nothing free about their return/repair policy.
4,I bought these on sale from Amazon last year and I think they are great for the price and you can read details about the binoculars in other reviews. I would say that because of their weight and size a tripod is a necessity if you intend to use them more than once in a blue moon and for that you need an adapter to link the binoculars to the tripod. But Celestron shouldn't bother including their adapter because it's totally inadequate for this model. It's plastic and allows way too much torsion that will drive you nuts.So take into consideration the need for a tripod and buying a different adapter. Oberwerk heavy duty is a metal one and big improvement. Subtracted a star for the crummy adapter.
4,For the price a good deal. However they feel a little on the "cheap" side. The optics seem well made but the mechanicle aspects can be troublesome. the diopter focusing seems stiff  and the tripod adapter seems a little small for the size of the binoculars. It comes with rubber protecting caps but they fall off easily especially the eyepiece.These are rather large (and heavy) so you will probably want a tripod if you intend to spend any amount of time using these.  Overall with minor quibbles these are very good for the price and should work well for astronomy bird watching or the like.
5,These 15x70 binocs get 5 stars in my book.  Mine came well collimated out of the box which I was holding my breath about considering the hit or miss reviews.  For $65 these are really a great value.  I can see Saturn Jupiter and itâs moons and even that beautiful smudge M31 Andromeda Galaxy.  While these are not super heavy to truly enjoy I would recommend a tripod and specifically the Oberwerk 4000.
4,This is a good pair of binos if you do occasional stargazing or birdwatching.They are bulkier but have crisp focus and produce a sharp image.In case you want to use for stargazing use it with a stable tripod.I have used it to watch the moon jupiter mars and the orion nebula as well as carried it on numerous mountain trips.I am giving it a 4 star as the caps used for covering the eyepieces and the tubes come off very easily. They wont stay snug and sooner or later you are bound to loose one . Besides the weight and the minor cover annoyance it is a great buy.
4,The binoculars are sturdy well made and have incredible visibility at low light.I am new to this hobby and these binoculars have really opened my eyes! (So to speak!)One fatal flaw - the tripod mount is plastic and poorly made. It makes the binoculars wobble like crazy at the slightest touch. Also when I tightened the screw on to the binoculars the knob cracked and fell off! I had to get needle nose pliers to take off the bracket!I highly recommend buying an all metal bracket tripod mount because you definitely need rick solid stability to appreciate what you see through these binoculars!
1,Box was open. The only thing I received was the binoculars. Nothing else. The adapter lens caps rain guard carrying case neck strap and lens cloth were missing.
5,This was a Christmas gift for my son in-law.  He loves them!!!!!  Everything is so crystal clear.  Best gift ever.  I will be buying another pair for my son for his birthday.
4,This item is big maybe to big for a kid but ok for an adult.  I wouldnât say it is terrible but I wouldnât say it is worth the price they want for it.  I purchased on sale on amazon and even then I thought it was too much for an item that wasnât that good.
5,at first i couldn't believe binoculars at a price so low would deliver the performance of these celestron's... even after reading all the other positive reviews... i remained skeptical.. but then i got my own pair... stepped outside on a starry moonlit night and discovered for myself the pure pleasure of viewing the heavens with them.sure they're a little heavy... but not that heavy... yeah they're a little bulky... but not that bulky... and when i took that first look at the moon it was so bright and so clear i thought it was right up the street. but the real treat came when i turned my gaze onto a darker part of the sky and saw stars and galaxies that were previously invisible. the giant 70mm lenses bring in more light than i could ever imagine. living in a city like los angeles used to mean i couldn't enjoy the stars... but no more.
5,The first thing you will notice when handling the Skymaster is an overall impression of quality. They are nicely weighted feel substantial in hand and are finished in matte black. The eyepieces are comfortable the focus dial is properly placed and the view is bright and fairly wide. I experienced none of the collimation problems that other reviews mention. They were dialed in right out of the box.  I am unsure how Celestron is able to create such a quality instrument at such a reasonable price point. Highly recommended.
3,Works good bought a second set for guests to use.
4,Pretty wonderful.  Can only give it a 4 out of 5 stars because I haven't had the opportunity to take it outside the city where there are no lights to sky view.  Using them inside the city though has been impressive.  I'm not a highly experienced sky watcher but i have to say these will definitely get the job done and done well.  Can't wait for our first trip out to the desert to really view the night sky.  I would say these are an excellent value for the money.
5,I'm impressed with these binoculars. For $70 plus shipping you get to see a lot. I could see the top of Mount Mansfield in Vermont and I live about 10 miles away from the mountain.I finally was able to see a strange item on top of a nearby mountain that have perplexed me for years. To my surprise it was a house - a gigantic house and I'm amazed someone would build one that high up considering it'll be difficult to commute up the hill there during winter.I could see stars so clear. Haven't seen the moon yet.You get pretty much everything you need in this order; binoculars covers a bag a leash a lens cleaner instructions and the tripod adapter. I would recommend buying a nicer binocular bag for more protection as the bag that comes with the package is quite flimsy.Overall highly recommended.
4,My first pair of "BIG" binoculars and am very impressed so far. Wanted for star watching decided to go bigger then my Nikon 10/50s.  Dut to their size a tripod is a must. The plastic tripod mount that comes with them is flimsy and vibrates I bought the shorter metal Vanguard B-185 mount and fixed that problem using a ball-mount on a good tripod.  Optical performance is very impressive... clear-sharp-and BRIGHT.  Great low light night views. I know I could have spent more(a lot more) but do not think the views would be much better as these are great!
5,Don't have a lot of time with these yet. So far I like them had a set of 20x80 way to heavy for me. Do have a tri pod haven't used these on it yet but much easer to handle without the tripod. Seem to be good quality good value for the price will be keeping these for sure.
4,Great value for some superior vision enhancers.  I live south of Los Angeles in Torrance Ca.  We can see stars at night but not what could be seen in the local mountains. I got these to try to see the Lovejoy Comet but couldn't find the right location. However what I did find BLEW MY MIND!!!!  I was looking at the lowest star in Orion's belt when I bumped the binoculars. It move down a bit and found so many stars my eyes almost exploded!Suggestion: Find a SOLID tripod not that crap from Target or Kmart...
5,If you are considering this purchase I'm going to tell you to just do it. There is no way anybody should be dissappointed by the quaility of these babies. I own 2 telescopes and yet I prefer my view of the heavens through these. It is a bit tricky to hold them still but you can still see so much more than with your naked eye and after using them a few times I had got the hang of it. I even spotted a few star clusters so far and I have only used them three times. I was in the market for a tripod but once you realise that all you need to do is sit and relax and hold them with one hand around the wide lense side and one hand at the smaller eyepiece side they become much more stable. Great view. Great product. Everybody should own a set.
5,Based on other reveiws of this item I wasn't sure what to expect in the way of the workmanship of the binoculars.  But within a minute of opening the box I was enjoying the use of them!  Based on price alone the lenses provide a bright clear view of objects . . . much better in fact than what I expected.  The only thing that is worth mentioning is that the strap that comes with the binoculars is a joke.  I threw mine away bought two 5/8" split rings which I hooked onto the strap anchors on the binoculars and use one of my Op Tech padded camera straps.  Also the rubber eyepiece cover is a little strange in that it really doesn't fit the eyepieces.  All-in-all one of the best bargains out there.  Only time will tell if the binoculars continue to perform to standard.
3,Binoculars are good you can see the Jupiter moon and most of the constellations with it.. its just a little tricky to handle as it shakes a lot.... So i bought the tripod for stable and nice view.... both made perfect pair and I really enjoy the stargazing
5,These binoculars are awesome for checking out the Moon the planets and their moons Messier objects and more.  They can't be beat for the money period.The accessories that come with them aren't so good.  The case is 80's-vintage pleather and is pretty floppy and insecure.  The tripod adapter looks like it came out of a children's cereal box.  Why would you put awesome binoculars of this quality on an astronomy-level tripod with a floppy-bendy adapter?I recommend purchasing the BARSKA adapter and Dolica 73-Inch Proline tripod along with this.  You'll look and feel like a pro while you surf the skies in steady comfort.Five out of five - you get every penny worth out of your binoculars with this deal.  Accessories are forgivable.
4,I read many of the reviews on Amazon before I purchased these binoculars.  I noted that many people had complained about the collimation.  So I ordered mine and hoped that they would be OK.  They were NOT.  The collimation was off terrible.  However when I called Amazon and explained my problem they immediately sent me another pair.  These were perfect.  Thanks Amazon for great customer service.  These are good binoculars and a great deal for the price.  No they're not what you'd get for $400... but they are good!
5,I owned a nice 12" Dobsonian telescope for a number of years.  I didn't use it as much as I could have because it was cumbersome to set up.  Recently I started watching the ISS on it's passes and decided to get these binoculars to get a better look---something that's virtually impossible to do with a telescope because of how fast it moves.  Wow what a treat.  I can make out the H shape of the station can see great detail of the lunar craters and can even see some of Jupiter's moons.  If you don't want to go all in on a telescope and be able to catch the ISS these are a terrific alternative.
4,I really wanted to see the moon on some of the nights I go camping.  These binoculars are large and heavy.  Not really surprised by that.  I've taken them out many times and always enjoy checking out the sky with them.  They're dope the moon is amazing.  Here's a photo I shot through them.
2,I just recieved my Celestron Skymaster 15x70 and was excited to put them to use on the next clear dark night sky especially after all of the good reviews they received here on amazon.  I took them out the first night and quickly felt dizzy and it kinda felt like i was slightly seeing double of everything.  I read the directions on how to first focus the left eye and then seperately focus the right eye and after doing this things just didnt seem quite right.  After a quick google search the next day i learned about collimation and how to tell if your binoculars are not collimated properly.  After doing what they recommended in the youtube video I watched i could tell without a doubt that the individual viewing cylinders didn't line up propertly and in fact are not even close to being correct.  I plan to send them back and hopefully they will send me another pair that are adjusted properly.ALSO the pair that i bought are considered to be "new" but i had to clean off some small grease spots on the large end of one of the binocular lenses and then i later noticed a smudge on the right side small lense which i wasn't able to wipe off and so i figured it must be a scratch or permanent impurity on the lense surface.  Let's just say i'm dissapointed and hope the next pair is better.
5,i was blow away with these i took them panama city beach and they are spot on great distance and even looking at the moon are awesome i would recommend to anyone & thinking about buying the next size for stars
5,Celestron is well known as one of the top makers of astronomical telescopes and they didn't stop there.  These astronomical binoculars are terrific at pulling in light from distant sources.  Some people might complain that they are unreasonably heavy but they really aren't that bad for their capabilities.  They practically suck in the light in the direction you're looking and the image resolution is phenomenal.  I had thought about purchasing some Nikon binoculars but opted for these as I wanted to use them for astronomical purposes.  The value for the money was awesome Amazon had them for $50 whereas the usual places I shop for astronomy gear wanted $75-100.  They come with a tripod adapter in case you want to set it up on a tripod.Bottom Line: Great binoculars for the value great resolving power and terrific light-gathering ability!
5,I got mine today and have already used them and these are really a great set of binoculars. I might add that some might find them a little heavy to hold but to me that says quality and durability.. Work rather well in low light conditions as I just tested. Easy to adjust if your right and left eye are not the same vision wise. Has a nice soft case for storing them in. Good tripod adaptor easy to install and fits my camera tripod perfectly.
5,I love these Binoculars for "bird" watching at the airport. I can make out pilots faces as they land on the runway (1/4-1/2 mile away). The only issue I have had is that they are hard to keep steady unless your leaning on something.
4,Worked okay in Yellowstone but need real high tech to reach out there.
4,Very good binoculars. Bought the 15 x 70 binoculars after taking an astronomy class at my local community college so I could view the night sky.  Able to see some moons of Jupiter good view of Andromeda galaxy and for the past few days been tracking the Lovejoy comet.  The only downside was that when my binoculars first arrived they were way out of collimation and I had to find the tiny adjustment screws and align the prisms.  Had to dock a star from my review for that.  Now I am happy with them.
4,Got these on Prime day for a good price. They work. They aren't the clearest things I have seen but for my needs they are great. You have to remember these are cheap they are not $800 pair of high end BiNocs they are double digit only for a reason so please don't expect them to be as good or clear as the highest end stuff you have seen but if you realize that you will be perfectly happy with these.
5,This is an excellent pair of binoculars from which I have found many uses.  Not only is it great to look at the stars but also function as well as any other binoculars would.  Some reviewer's stated that it was a heavy unit but I found it to be a very light weight unit.  Some reviewer's said it was hard to keep steady but I did not find that to be the case. It does have a smaller field of view than some of the others but it brings that field of view in close so you can examine it well.  Overall I thought this was a great binoculars at a very reasonable price.
4,My binoculars arrived and they diopter eye cut fell off. It left a very sticky residue. I contacted  amazon and reported the defect the replacement was ordered immediately and Iâll send back the troubled binoculars back for free. I have been a Celestron brand fan for many years and this was the first time to have any kind of problem hope the second pair srrivesgg defect free.
5,These things are pretty nice my wife calls them "cartoon binoculars."  Haha.  Anyway the only complaint would be that they are a bit soft around the edges.  Other than that the view is really nice I'm impressed that they can focus so closely (supposedly 42'+/-) away but also do a very good job on the items miles away.  Try searching out items that are a few miles away they do a great job in this range.  Someone mentioned being able to read the numbers on a plane at 30K I don't know about that one but planes look pretty good at 10 to 15K.
5,Really nice binoculars for a fair price. Viewing the moon is a whole new experience. Would recommend using a tripod for extended viewing as they are a bit heavier and harder to hold steady for long periods of viewing. Great binocs though!
5,This is the best bang for the buck for huge binoculars.  I replaced my spotting scope that was much more expensive.  I like binoculars because there is less strain using both eyes.  Part of the focus adjustment is plastic and it flexes if you push on the eye piece.  Not a huge issue as long as you don't push on the eye pieces.  The glass seems very clear for the price.  I purchased a pair for my dad for Christmas.  I ended up keeping them and purchased two more to give away as presents.  They come with a tripod adapter which is nice because they are heavy.
3,Right out of the box the rubber strips which serve as thick grips around the binoculars were pulling away from the housing. Like a banana the grips easily peeled away from the instrument. These were not stored in a hot environment so I can only suppose that the gluing at the factory was poor. There was only one dot of glue visible under the worst-peeling grip.This was a gift so the defect was very disappointing. Coupled with the recommended tripod (Vista Explorer 60-Inch Lightweight Tripod with Tripod Bag) this gift struck out twice as the tripod is not up to the job of supporting these binocs. So I'm going to order another pair of different brand binoculars and look for a TiltAll tripod on my local ubiquitous for-sale bulletin board named for Craig.The lenses provided sharp images and magnified properly and Amazon delivered promptly so I'm leaving 3 stars.
5,Let me say this I have looked through over 13 binoculars by the big optics manufactures and several midgrade telescopes...forget the $600 telescope or $200 binoculars. I brought this skymaster giant to a star gazing party which audience had plenty of cash to spend on high end optics and I received many accolades when I told them i purchased this for well under $100.Pro tip: Take the stand with you for these these are heavy and high quality glass elements inside.Best for: Those not looking for quality over portability. Any outdoor enthusiast who wants maximum brightness for stars or dusk time viewing.
5,I really like these Binocs. I use them as an accessory to my telescope. The wider angle view is effective to locate star clusters and planets prior to finding them on the 'scope.  You can 'see' and identify most of the major constellations even around city light and Jupiter with all its moons.  I didn't find them as heavy as some previous reviews warned; I can use them in hand for about an hour before a rest is needed. I also use a tripod which provides a very stable platform if you don't want the image to dance around if holding by hand.
3,Good binoculars so far. No problems I can see. Clear image decent range. Keep in mind that this is the first pair of binoculars I've bought.Word of warning  I bought mine from Amazon (not a 3rd party) and I thought it would be new but it was clearly used. Now that typically doesn't bother me but the packaging was a little too easy to open (no tape on the inner box) the lens had a pretty solid fingerprint on it (was hard to clean without damaging the lens) there were finger prints all over the binoculars from someone with greasy fingers(lay off the fried food) and a roughed up owners manual. Not a big deal to some people but it lost some of my confidence. This is pretty unprofessional in my opinion.So far I can't see any more negligence. Love the product disappointed in the delivery.
5,Easily adjustable & has very clear view. Need a tripod for steady view of long distant objects. Very satisfied.
5,Love these especially for the price but be warned that they're BIG. Actually the name "Giant" is not just hyperbole. They're probably close to a foot long. Great optics and easy controls for focusing and tweaking what you're seeing and you can see a long ways away. It comes with a decent-enough carrying bag (you may prefer to invest in an inexpensive but more substantial camera backpack with adjustable insides that be adapted to this) and a handy mount that can set the glasses on a standard tripod. Really awesome and excellent for what they are. They also include a microfiber cloth for cleaning the lens. Nice deal all around I think.
5,Bought these at the suggestion of A.Ron.  It got great reviews from several YouTube bloggers and internet articles. Well reviewed here too. They are a beautiful peice of equipment. Well packaged came with no issues. I am seeing double with these however. Collimation issues now I need to get in touch with celesteon.
4,These are really good but hard to keep steady without a tripod. We are getting used to them and the magnification is great.
5,I had my 15x70's for over a year and I like them very much. They are ideal for a quick peek at the sky if you do not have much time to set up the telescope but still want to have a look at the heavens. I use them also as spotting binos for some deep sky objects then I aim my large scope at the target. They are very nice to handle with the rubber finish. Good light gathering ability and good resolution. I think they are an amazing value at the advertised Amazon price which includes shipping. It takes a little bit of practice holding them steady but you get the hang of it rather quickly. I do not particularly like the tripod adapter and found that they vibrate when mounted on the tripod. For everything else they are great.
5,Dont hesitate get these instead of the very expensive ones. Your only comprimise will be the money you save. I am very happy with these. Cromatic aberation is not too bad during day use on terrestrial objects at long distances like with a telescope. Night use is awsome... Get em and have fun...If you are looking for a detailed review just read all the others. Take good care of these and know the phisical limits of the materials provided and you will have em for a life time.
4,My second pair of these. First ones broke at the tube to focus arm. They are really good for the price but donât drop them.
5,I bought these for fire spotting and they are very good for that.  Probably wouldwork well for hazmat recon too. The field of view and image brightness are quite good. They pull in a lot more light than the mini-binocs I had been using and at this price I am not too worried about them bouncing around in the back of the car or under the seat in the fire engine. They are about as powerful as you could hand-hold and I actually added a monopod for easier viewing. They seem well made and sturdy and the action is smooth. The depth of field is somewhat shallow so they might not be optimal for following a moving object but for anyting static they are plenty sharp.-Rat
5,I am not an astronomer.  I live on a family farm and thought we needed a good pair of binoculars.  I am so impressed.  We can see everything so crystal clear now.  We like to look at wildlife and just check out things on our 300 acre farm.  These come in so handy.  Not to mention how impressed I am with looking at the moon and stars at night.  I can see craters on the moon you can't see with the naked eye.  These are perfect binoculars for those hard to buy for.  Just think how happy Dad would be to these for Fathers Day Birthday or Christmas.  Don't forget to get the Vista Exlporer Tripod.  Both of these are less then $90 with prime shipping.  Great gift and every day use.
5,Yes you can get a high power pair of binoculars for less than $75 thanks to the wonders of Chinese manufacturing which seems to be getting better by the day. The binoculars are an excellent value for the price paid and will enable you to see many deep sky objects and the planets. The moon is spectacular when viewed through these.To hand-hold you will need an extremely steady pair of hands or a good tripod. Do not skimp in this area. Thin spindly tripods will cause the image to shake badly.The overall quality is good considering the price. While the fit and finish are not on par with the Nikons I own they are not bad all said. With some care (keeping them dry and not subjecting to big shocks) you should expect to get decades of service.
4,Danged heavy as a horse but it does do the job.  Even while using lying down & looking for places in the heavens to spotto point my Pentax K-5 Astrophotography set up my arms give up after 5 minutes.They do work quite well to spot barely visible or not visible heavenly objects....like the Andromeda Galaxy.The binocular wide view really makes the heavens & the Milky Way look glorious on a dark non-light polluted night.Great Bank for the buck!
3,these work ok in bright daylight where one's eyes (brain?) can compensate for the massive misalignment but don't try using them at night because Jupiter suddenly has 8 Galilean moon instead of 4. yes there's a reason they're so inexpensive. color and clarity are excellent though. these were misaligned out of the box.
5,El producto llegÃ³ antes de la fecha estimada y en buenas condiciones. Cumple con las funciones que expresa en las especificaciones. De dÃ­a ofrece un excelente enfoque y por la noche es espectacular
5,Yes celestron skymaster binoculars 15Ã70 met all my expectations. A very good brand. Recommend Celestron astronomical equipment to all I know
5,Arrived quickly/packed well. Very light for size and the views are incredible. A tripod is better for longer viewing but easy to hold for short periods. Showed my neighbor - he liked them so well he immediately ordered a pair. Nice on terrestrial viewing but unbelievable when used for astronomy. You'll see things you never imagined especially when scanning between items you already know are there. Nice wide field of view and mine were clear almost to the edge. Amazing how much these see that smaller binocs miss. Definitely recommend. If you do get a bad pair (mine and my neighbor's were optically and mechanically fine) Amazon's return policy is quick and efficient. Easy to swap for a new item if necessary. Just don't keep a bad pair and blame Amazon. Overall outstanding set of binoculars. Outstanding bargain especially for $49 with free shipping.
4,So far so good.  Just took it onto the roof in Philadelphia looked to the southwest and saw Jupiter and training the binoculars on it i saw the planet very clearly and several of its moons.  Terrestrial viewing was also rewarding with clear sharp viewing.  The optics are not quite up to my TeleView 85 but what is.
5,BIG! I love them. But I had to order some small ones for observing ? On the Down-Low.
3,i purchased this 15 x 70 binocular for astronomical observations- which i am doing for 20 years with other binocular & telescope.this model was selected due to bigger aperture & larger exit pupil- which gives good eye relif.my pair came with misaligned left & right tubes- views are clear if seen with one eye at a timeit has chromatic abression- moon has red & blue edgesover all sharpness of image is limited- image is big but blurry - my 7x50 shows smaller but sharper image. and this 7 x 50 is really cheap one costing only $30- made in china.effectively good 7 x 50 & this 15 x 70 showed same details of number plate of a distant carpackaging & delivery was very goodnot recomended for astronomy useonly two stars for binocular with extra star for amazon service
5,The stars at night are so unbelievable. I can see so many of them with these.
4,For viewing birds mountains and objects far as 10 miles it's ok but for viewing of Moon Saturn rings Jupiter and Venus requires tripod for image stability.
5,Excellent Celestron SkyMaster Giant 15x70 Binoculars!  They show more detail than I ever could imagine for this price.  My 5 year old grand-daughter said; wow grandma this is cool!!!  We also bought a star dial to complement that shows where and when certain stars can be found.  No regrets here!I forgot to mention these are too heavy for my grand-daughter age 5 so I bought a tripod to mount them to and that makes it easier for my grand-daughter; I find and focus on the moon then she can step up to the binoculars and see the amazing moon...  We are still loving the view!  our next step is a telescope now that I know she loves hanging with grandma and just starring into God's amazing beauty for us to see.
5,These are NOT tiny.  These monstrous sized lenses are crisp  clear  gather light very well.  Looking at the moon I saw features that I never saw with a friend's telescope.  Gotta have a tripod or at least a monopod to view for any length of time. 15x magnification yields fantastic detail.
4,Purchased as "Daily Deal" for wildlife observation and casual stargazing. Clear optics no fogging or other issues after use in wet conditions. Obviously these are rather large and somewhat heavy - so close supervision is wise with kids or others not accustomed to using binoculars - and for extended use consider mounting them on a small tripod for viewing comfort (an adapter mount is included for this purpose).
3,Overall these are good binoculars.  See the pictures I took with my phone looking through the lens.  It doesnt do it justice but you can get a sense of the magnification.These are good for typical use but I read some reviews that talked about using for astronomy.  There is no chance in he!! you are going to see the rings of Saturn or any other planet for that matter.You will likely need a tripod as these will get heavy after a while and will be hard to hold still.  But overall they are better than standard binoculars and seem well made.
5,The 15X is the limit of what I can hand hold for viewing (otherwise too much shaking w/o tripod)Quicker than setting up a telescope I use for backyard star gazing with friends (Oh look at the Orion nebula! No we cannot resolve Saturn's rings. Yes that is Jupiter see the little bright dots...those are her moons!)Great terresterial resolution also.
4,I was surprised at the quality of this binoculars for the price I paid.First it was the largest binoculars i have seen.After taking it out of it's well boxed inclosure i took it to my back porch and started spying way into the distant forest. The view was clear and clean. It works better with a tripod and the tripod attachment that came with the unit. I could see the wild geese in the pond up clearly and the hawk that always fly around the forest.The moon seems so close through these binoculars. I am planning to have fun with these exploring the night sky in the country side.
5,Bought this to use on the beach when we four wheel with our Jeep. You can see a long way with this binocular !!! Doesn't pull a huge amount of ambient light but at this power I didn't really expect it to. For daylight it's great. Haven't tried it  on the sky yet but will real soon. Well worth the money. When I showed them off at my Jeep club I could have sold at least 6 pair of them. Most said they will go here and buy a set. Good deal !!
5,I got mine for $54 and I have to say Amazon got it to me in record time. Out of the box they are not really impressive. Included with the Skymaster is a Tripod mount rubber "slip on" lens covers a cheesy little neck strap and a velcroed bag with a pretty good strap on it. First impressions are good. I am pleased with the sharpness although it never quite gets razor sharp like my camera lenses but still for the money this is an excellent pair of beater binoculars. I bought these to use for a spotting scope for range shooting. The Tripod mount is a bit wobbly and annoying for the constant jiggling while you try to use "hands free" but for the price this is the best deal on amazon.
5,These are a great set of binoculars for the money.  We use them for spotting elk and deer off of our deck.Update:I put these on a tripod and the tripod tipped over immediately.  The binoculars didn't look damaged but I was seeing double vision after that.  I set them on the large end of the scopes and one side was definitely off kilter ever so slightly.  I grabbed the bodies of each scope and I attempted to straighten the right scope just a hair.  I heard a pop and the scope went back into place.  Good as new.  Sometime to check for if you're seeing double vision.
4,It is really a great inexpensive fixed lenses binoculars and I will find it useful; however it was late and I was very tired when I ordered it and I did not read all of the details. I thought it was going to be an adjustable 15-40 lenses. However I have it set up in my den for viewing my back yard and will use it often. I have a 10-24 power binoculars that is great but not the best after 15 power. The skymaster is very clear and "heavy" and my 76 year old neck is tender.
4,I had to return 2 pairs before I got a pair with decent collimation (optical alignment) but I consider them a good valuefor the price! They do a pretty good job. Not as nice as my $400 Orion Resolux 10.5x70's of course but they make anice second pair. Understand though that they are not "knock-around" binos. Their optical mounting is rather lightweightso they need some gentle handling. But good binos for the money if you are willing to possibly have to go through a coupleof pair!
4,The only reason I chose this model over another was a person put in the review that they were way back in center field and could read the lips of the picture having a conversation...Well maybe a bit extreme or maybe the beer had already kicked in.  Anyway... the product was good just maybe not what I was expecting.  I have a 20x50 already and thought this would make a big difference...maybe should have went with the x80.  Shipped out same day and I got it two days later.  The product is good...just maybe I should have done a little more investigating versus looking at these reviews.
4,First three pair were uncollimated (seeing double).  Amazon quickly exchanged them and with the fourth pair I now see only one moon.  This is obviously common so I was ready to send them back until I received a collimated pair.  I'm very much a layman with optics in general.  I don't have much of a frame of reference but I'd say these provide a great view of the moon.  Seems like a great deal for the price as long as you're prepared to exchange should you need to.
5,I've just received these binoculars and I have to say that I am incredibly impressed what you get for the price (~$60).  The focus is really good and the chromatic aberration (color fringes) are minimal.  I was able to mount the binoculars on my camera tripod using the adapter.  However the adapter is an I-Beam shape for rigidity but being long and plastic actually flexes quite  bit and causes wobble on the binocular.  Ideally that adapter should be made of metal.  A another poster mentioned they used epoxy to fill in the I-Beam gabs to make it a more solid structure.  I will probably do the same. For the price of everything I am very happy.
1,These binoculars are advertised as being made for looking at stars and planets; however these binoculars are nothing but just a  normal pair of binoculars sold at a higher price because they're supposedly for astronomy. I bought for my 14 year old to look at the planets stars and moon thinking he would see them better with these than normal binoculars I was wrong. You can see the moon not much better than you can with a 35mm camera lens. As for the planets all of them appear small as if they were just bright stars. If these weren't a Christmas present I'd return them. I will not buy anything else from this company.
3,A good buy but mediocre in absolute terms.  The coatings are not great so contrast is low and there is a lot of flare on bright objects such as planets.  They do capture a lot of light.  Sharpness is moderately good.  Focus is stiff.  Front lens caps are good the single rear eyepiece cap is a poor fit.  A sturdy tripod is essential but the included mount is so flexible as to be useless.  I used it's knob to make a sturdy mount from oak.  Overall this is great for the price and will give good views of large objects such as M44 and the Hyades and Pleiades but don't expect really high quality.  The false depth resulting from luminance differences is a great effect only binoculars will give.
5,This was definitely a good purchase. I am not a pro at binoculars but I am happy I bought these.I use them all the time.I do need to buy a tripod though.
5,These work great. I can see stripes on Jupiter 4 of its moons the Andromeda galaxy and a lot more. And that's just been the late winter sky.They are heavy. You're going to want a tripod or at least a long stick with a binocular mount on it. But that's okay because you're going to want a tripod with optics this powerful anyway- the image will wobble around a lot unless they are on a tripod or at least braced against a post or something so unless you've got superhuman steady hands spring for a cheap tripod.On nice nights you can lay on your back and use them pretty good though but you don't want to lay down in winter.
4,I bought these for the extra power; took a chance on a friend's recommendation plus the Celestron name.  To save you further reading - these are not in the same class as Celestron telescopes I've owned in the past.Plus side - the optics are clear and the alignment of the prisms is surprisingly sharp.Negatives - only one - the lack of quality multi-coating on the lenses yields far more fringing than is found in higher priced Nikon binoculars.  It can be overlooked but I found it annoying distracting and overall objectionable in a viewing device of this caliber.
1,After reading the glowing reviews on this product I was very disappointed to discover that the product is of very poor quality.  In my case I did not discover this until after the return window had closed so I'm left with a set of non usable binoculars.These binoculars were bought as a christmas gift to my wife.  I used them just briefly and found that they were hard to focus but I didn't get a chance to investigate fully at the time.  My wife complained that these binoculars were too powerful and she was having trouble with them.  I didn't listen unfortunately.So this weekend I had 20 minutes to investigate the cause of the difficulty in focusing with these binoculars.  I started out by closing one eye and using the center wheel to focus on a distant object I then opened my other eye and used the combiner focus to merge the two eyes (standard binocular focusing technique).  No joy.  I was perplexed this always worked.  I then focused on a distant horizon with one eye open then switching to the opposite eye open.  The horizon jumped up about 2 degrees.  I finally figured out why these binoculars were difficult to focus they couldn't be focused with both eyes open!!!If you buy these check them by looking way out at the horizon and make sure you can focus out there.  If you can't return them I wish I did.I guess I can break them into two rather small telescopes since you can't use these as binoculars.
5,I added this high powered set of binoculars to a growing toolbox of binoculars for bird and star gazing.  I've used it for birds more than stars at this point.  I pick it up when I'm looking deeper in the backyard and it's great.  Focus is clear and image is bright.Update March 2012I keep this by the back window for bird watching.  Use it often.  Very clear.  I also love taking it to sports.  They are monstrous no doubt but you get such a great field of view at the high magnification.  I can look in the Cardinals dugout or the Blues Bench and see what's going on.  At the theatre they are amazing too.  Forget the mini binoculars.  go big!
5,I am an amateur astronomer I believe it was best $50 spent on these someone told me that sometimes 20x80 (one size up) also go for $50 it was not in my case so I stayed with this. It is not too heavy but after long some viewing time you will feel your hands getting tired I would recommend getting a tripod it will help with the hand shake and hands not getting tired. Being a photographer Chromatic Aberration is one thing that bothers me and often you will see that but its not end of the world. I was able to see Orion Nebula with these which was huge. As I said I am an amateur astronomer I will know more with time.
5,I would never have believed how incredible these binoculars are if I had not looked through them.  My brother had gotten a pair.  He paid too much since he bought them at a retail store instead of Amazon.  The first time I looked through his I focused on a small airplane that was flying by.  When I could clearly see the pilot's face I knew I had to have a pair.  Some people will find they are a bit heavy to use for long periods without a tripod.  However I have no problem using them.  They are much better than the spotting scope I used to carry for birding.  I now bird with a pair of binoculars for close view and these incredible Celestrons for everything else.
5,This is the most perfect pair of binoculars anyone who is just starting out with star gazing can hope for. The 70 mm lens makes the moon a magnificent sight. Although I only recently got it I have been able to see the Orion Nebula in surprisingly reasonable detail. A few days ago I was able to see Jupiter and 4 of its moons. The best part of the binoculars is that it is ready to use out of the box. I do recommend a tripod to get a stable image (I just ordered one :) ). I am just starting out with amateur astronomy and I could not have hoped for an easier to use instrument. Oh I live in the city with a lot of light pollution and everything I observed was under these conditions.
5,The 15x70 Skymaster is an amazing value...This is big and bulky but light in weight. But you need big optics to gather the most light.  This performs way above this price point. I've purchased several as gifts for my friends who live on the water and they use them to watch boats and the opposite shore line. My son borrowed mine and never returned it...he uses it for astronomy instead of his telescope. He says he can see the space station. Everybody loves these. Great gift idea.
5,Mis primeros binoculares muy bien presentados se ven supersolidos definitivamente necesita tripode  muy muy muy clara la imÃ¡gen.
4,This are great for pulling things close in.They're right on the edge of what you can hand hold and still see things without too much shaking. Anything more powerful would need a monopod or tripod to use. Thought about the 20x80 for a hot second. Glad I didn't since I think I'd pretty much have to have a monopod or tripod to use the 20x80 at all.On a tripod these are even better.Great performance for the prices
5,You will not find a better value at this sized bino. IF you gaze up at stars high in the skies your arms may get tired but I do recommend these over the larger ones which would definitely require a tripod or bino mount. These I keep around to introduce others to spotting objects in the night sky. In a dark area there will be too many stars within view and you will get bewildered. Bring along a zero gravity chair and take a look out at your next camping trip.
4,I'm just starting out as an amateur stargazer. My first impression on this binoculars is that it's big and a bit heavy. If you're going to be spending a lot of time locating and focusing on various objects in the night sky you're definitely going to need a tripod especially if you have shaky hands. And your neck will thank you for it. However I'm very pleased with its ease of use clarity field of vision and the eye relief feature. It's also excellent for other recreational use like bird watching. In summary this is the best value for money for a binoculars with its features.
4,Nice for star gazing if you hav something to brace your arm against.  Great for bird watching.  The binoculars themselves are just what I wanted.  The accessories are a little flimsy: the eye piece cover doesn't fit well and strap is untrustworthy.  It came with a brace for a tripod but no way for the brace to attach to the binoculars and no explaination as to how it was supposed to work.  But I'm very happy with the binoculars themselves.
5,Very nice binoculars although a bit too powerful and heavy to hand hold.  Recommend a good stable support.  Highly recommended for deep sky viewing.  For terrestrial use a good tripod is necessary.  Colours are true and definition is very good.  Aberrations are minimal.  Field of view is complete with a mild roll off at the edges.  Works well for eyeglass wearers.  Really surprised at the low price versus quality.  Highly recommended.
5,They work really well for terrestrial as well as celestial sights.
5,I bought these binoculars for my husband for our trip to Africa. During daytime we used it for scanning distant wildlife and mountain ridges. Excellent performance and lightweight. I also brought them to Hawaii for some star gazing on Mauna Kea. Telescopes are heavy and expensive and since we were carrying camera equipment we brought these binoculars along. We were able to quickly find Trapizium in Orion's nebula saw the Andromeda galaxy that the guides were pointing out on large telescopes. Then we set up and focus our cameras.This is the best amateur astronomy instrument for the money on the market right now
5,We were very pleased with the quality of the optics you get at this price. Easy to handle and manipulate.Light enough to use without a tripod. We were so pleased by the celestial objects we viewed the first few nights (Jupiter and four of its moons Mercury Venus and a very good look at the I.S.S.) that we decided to buy a Celestron telescope. Daytime viewing is also very good . We also liked the longview feature of these for people who wear glasses. We discovered it made it possible to get a photograph quite easily and you don't have to touch them when tripod mounted for steadier viewing.
3,Decent binoculars for the price but the left eye piece keeps coming off and I had to crazy glue it to the body of the binoculars. And these were brand new in the box sealed. A bit disappointing. I am just sick of sending defective stuff back...But also disappointed in Amazon's quality control. If the order is under a certain number of dollars I eat it. If I can fix it I fix it myself. But that's not how it is supposed to be. The image out of these binoculars is decent I can't complain but Celestron's quality control in China is non-existent. Be prepare to fix something when you get them that's all I am saying.
1,I broke down and ordered these binoculars - too cheap to resist with free shipping.  I sent them right back - the collimation was way off.  If you can't use them with both eyes they're not really binoculars are they?  Oberwerk's 15X70 binoculars probably the same unit but twice the price mentions prism adjusting screws you can access under the rubber armor and they tell you how to collimate the things with a jeweler's screwdriver if you're up to it.  Celestron doesn't mention any adjustment and I neglected to check but there is a disclaimer in the included pamphlet that says (in five languages) the binocs are probably out of collimation and this is normal for high powers (15X and above) because it's too difficult to get right.In addition the adjustable right eyepiece didn't remain parallel to the optical plane as it was rotated so prism adjustment may have been pointless there.  Mounted with the included wiggly plastic adapter a look at the moon Saturn and the Auriga clusters (with one eye or the other) showed the optics aren't very good - sharp focus was unattainable.  Lots of chromatic aberration and astigmatism.  All that light-gathering potential becomes a waste of glass.  I get better views with my Travelites (20mm objectives) and you can put 'em in your pocket.Perhaps I got a bad pair but I don't think so.  I think you'd be extraordinarily lucky to get some you'd be happy with despite the many positive reviews.  My advice: save your money and your time these things are huge heavy and utterly useless.
5,This is my third Celestron binocular purchase. Also have the 20X80 and the 25X100 pairs. This is perfect for quick grab and go viewing and is ideal for day and night viewing. Simpler viewing with single focus eyepieces.  Mounts easily on a tripod if needed and had no problems quickly screwing in the adapter. I love the other two pairs for higher magnification and more light but these are much much lighter and are great for just about any type of viewing.
5,Love these. I can actually see out into the night sky and see things I've never seen with my own eyes like the moon in INCREDIBLE detail. They are pretty heavy so get a tripod for easy viewing. I'm a totally noob for sky viewing and these binoculars but I like them. The phone adapter was a little hard to mess with at first but eventually you figure it out.
5,I bought these about 4 months ago and loved them I used them every day and every night for at least a week and then I read about a guy using panty hose as a filter to observe the sun unfortunately I fell for this stupid trick looked at the sun for less than a second and lost vision in both of my eyes I lost my job and its been a bit embarrassing telling people how it happened but I was able to regain the majority of my vision and just took the bandages off last week please don't do what I did as im sure im not the only one who has tried to view the sun with these.
1,No matter what I try there is a double image of whatever I look at
5,Probably the best purchase I have ever made. I've brought these along for many camping and hiking trips and it is well worth it. Every time they're out people around me ask to use them and are amazed by the extra details in the landscape that you can see. I've even taken some great pictures through them with my phone.See wildlife in great detail.Star gazing is amazing.Watch airplanes up in the sky.See what your neighbors are really up to.Opportunities are endless.
5,Great binoculars comes well packaged. the middle nob that widens or closes the view is very stiff which is nice to keep it firm in place as your browsing the stars. the focus nob on the top middle is nice and easy to use. focusing each eye piece was a little confusing but I got it. overall great binoculars if you want to see the night sky and all its glory better plus details on the moon.
4,Great for the price
4,I got these for my husband as a gift since he is such a nerd when it comes to the stars and planets. He loves looking out at the sky with these especially the moon. You can see it perfectly. However I do recommend getting a stand for them as they are rather heavy and even the slightest movement makes it too blurry to really get a good view on anything.
5,These binoculars are perfect with one exception.  They're very heavy!  They really must be used with a tripod for any sort of quality viewing.  I've even tried to steady myself by bracing my elbows on various surfaces and I still get the wobble.  They're just too long and unwieldy to hold by hand.  Otherwise they are fantastic.  I don't have the tripod yet but borrowed one briefly from a neighbor and that really took these from virtually useless to great for spotting what I want to see with my telescope.  I've had some incredible moon views too with these!
4,I bought my brother a set for stargazing and a set for my father to bird watch.The quality is Excellent! for bird watching or star gazing.More portable than a telescope and the dual vision helps focus on objects- no backwards vision like a telescope.The 15x70 is a great magnification for a beginner stargazer. Comes with a small (6 in) tripod. but can be attached to others.Love 'em!! only lost one star because they are heavy and awkward to carry / store. but great for a car.
2,I didn't like these at all. I was reading a bunch of reviews on these about how good they are and figured I would give them a shot. But in the end I wasn't impressed at all. I had nothing but problems trying to get them adjusted and focused in. The only time that they got close to getting focused in was in really low light and the glare from the sun was just horrible. I was using them for hunting so I can't really speak for the people that use them for looking at the stars. Yes they are probably to heavy for most people but you are basically holding two spotting scopes to your eyes. What do you expect?  I was reading all the negative reviews about the barska version and thought that maybe barska had gone down hill in qualilty so i bought a set of these. I have owned a set set of barska 15x70 but somebody had stolen them so I wanted to find a good replacement set. In the end I am just going to buy another set of the barska and no i would not recommend these for anyone that hunts.
3,Celestron SkyMaster Giant 15x70 Binoculars with Tripod Adapter        Optics is very nice I suggest you use a Tripod.Had them for 2 months now and today the adjusting knob for the focus failed - Celestron will replace them under warranty for a $14.95 fee.Got my replacement (2 weeks later) - optics on this pair is not even close to the pair I returned. The faulty pair I had to return had very clear and crisp ''picture'' over the whole lens the new pair is very fuzzy on the edges and not as clear over the rest of the lenses as the old ones.Will contact Celestron today and see what my options will be!
5,So far  very good. I had no issues w/ any adjustments. I have a pair of expensive minoltas. These seem as good for costing 5 times less. They work well enough that i have purchased a i phone cam adapter so i can take pictures and videos asa well.  There is one negative: The tripod adapter is too weak to elimanate wobble. Due to weight of biocs. I ordered a celestron metal adapter avaliable at amazon. The reviews say it does the job proper. No wobble.
5,For the price that I paid these binoculars are very nice for long distance  viewing I would  recommend them to whoever is looking for binoculars to view the sky
4,Just received my pair so far everything is in good order. I had no issue with the optics during the day. its suppose to be clear tonight can't wate to truly try them out. The neck strap is a joke at lest i hope it is. The tripod mount is ok but i will be replacing it along with my current tripod. so far very pleased. Now these are my first pair of binoculars for astronomy for the price you really cant beat them.
5,I've received these Celestron Skymaster 15x70 binoculars in outstanding condition without any collimation problems.  These are great for outdoors either in sun light or for nocturnal use.  It is easy to use adjust focus and provides a good colorful sight.  Although they are kind of heavy so it is much better to use with a tripod but while doing some bird watching these binoculars still come useful.Based on the price paid I think these binoculars are of good quality and affordable price.
5,Not too heavy but a way to steady it is necessary for stargazing.
4,I bought this to accompany my thirty year old Celestron Deluxe 20x80 for which I paid nearly 8 times the prices way back in the mid 1980s.  And they are still worth the price thirty years later.  So I was expecting that at these prices collimation issues color fringing etc would be a problem.  Not for my pair! Crisp and clean in both eyes and together and focusing to a point.  Not bad on the outer edges either.  So far so good but I'll be back if things change.
3,Delivery is fast but I didnât know why the box was opened like the picture I upload when I got it. It was so weird!!!
5,I read the reviews before I bought these and saw that there would be a good chance they would have a double image when I got them. But because some reviewers described how to adjust them I took a chance and got them. Well there was a double image when I got them they were also very easy to adjust. I got the images together in one shot about a quarter turn of the screw There was a minor up and down split in the image then. I had to tweak the other side to get that out. It took me three attempts and no more than ten minutes to get them adjusted right on.Now I'm very pleased with these the image is very nice and clear for me.
2,UPDATED (JULY 14 2015)So I returned the second pair and it went smoothly and then I checked other reviews of different brands and decided to try a pair of Orion GiantView 15 x 70's.  WOW what a well made item they are!  I bought a used pair in mint condition for $141 on Amazon and am thrilled with them so far.  They even came with a hard carrying case like a small suitcase.I recommend you try Orion.  It's worth the extra bucks in my opinion even at retail of over $200.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Bought one pair brand new. Opened them up and the double vision was awful. If I torqued the barrels enough I could see single vision. Really poor quality.  Returned and bought ANOTHER pair of near new cause brand new ones were now 40%more expensive. Just got the second pair and the double vision is even worse!  Wow  how can they sell these?  I wanted to become a beginner stargazer with binoculars  but if they are all so bad  I may have to get a telescope.  Not what I wanted.
4,I bought these for my mom for xmas they work great but because they are so large and heavy it's hard not to shake when you hold them. I reccomend getting a tripod for sure! I took this cool pic of the moon with my phone looking thru the binoculars
5,The other reviews have captured everything so I won't waste your time. Here's a newbie amateur astronomer perspective:* They arrived in perfect condition and have provided me hours of fantastic views of the moon planets stars clusters nebulae and galaxies.* Thanks to excellent light-gathering you don't need pitch-black skies.* The weight (5 pounds) and high magnification (15x) restricts the field of view (4.4 degrees) and makes the view shaky so you need a really good tripod.* Excellent eye relief ensures that you can use them with spectacles.* I don't know how good/bad the tripod adapter is because mine was missing.* No you won't see what the Hubble telescope sees.* Yes I would buy another one in a heartbeat if I had to!
5,I have had the opportunity to use some very high end binoculars and have first hand experience of how bright and clear good optics can be.  These do not meet that standard but then again they cost about 10 percent as much and are still very usable.  The images are clear and sharp and at this magnification they are very comfortable to use.  I would recommend them to anyone except possibly people that would use them for hours a day.  Those folks may want to spend the extra cash.  They can be used handheld although I wouldn't try it with any higher magnification but they do get heavy and that is when the tripod mount comes in handy.
5,Bought this to do stargazing on our Hawaii trip.  I worked great.  We had dark skies and I was able to see many deep space objects such as the Lagoon Nebula Trifid Nebula Eagle Nebula star clusters such as M22 and Hercules cluster (fuzzy object in the sky) and much more.  Binoculars were a lot of fun to use plus I was able to use them to look at Molakai from Maui and spot waterfalls from 10 miles away :)
5,I purchased the Celestron SkyMaster Giant 15x70 binos to assist in my law enforcement duties. They are great to have in the truck and perform as advertised. Super clear no double images magnification is outstanding and no problems with durability while bouncing around on harsh roads. I see that some people complain about the weight of these binos but they are about the same as my other pair of binos which is a 10x50 smaller frame so I was surprised that they weighed as little as they do. They out perform my issued binos that costed about $450-500. I would buy them again and I recommend them to people that I work with. 5 stars!
4,Very good optics for the price.  Surprisingly good.  Just small enough to prop your elbows on your knees and see across a miles-wide lake.  So far I have gotten better terrestrial use of them rather than for astronomy. Very happy with these although the tripod adapter broke the very first time I tried to use it...
5,pros: you can see very far and VERY clearlycons: its heavy and chunky but I blame the universe for that
4,I was specifically looking for binoculars for the eclipse and somehow got routed to these without realizing that they are NOT solar safe binoculars. My bad for not reading the description well enough. They seem to be pretty decent binoculars though even if I have no use for them. Maybe I'll take up bird watching or something...
2,Ordered these binoculars on 25 June 12 and were delivered as stated by Amazon.  These binoculars were fair in viewing daylight objects.  At night horrible.  Double vision when viewing objects in the night skys and the clarity was not good.  I have a set of 30 year old binos that are 8x40s and they work much better than the Celestron SkyMasters 15x70s.  I actually got a headache trying to adjust them to get rid of the double vision.  I did adjust them per the instruction manual but it didn't help.  If I closed one eye then I would see just one object.  No matter what I did with them adjustment wise I still seen double.  I figured there was an issue with the binos not properly collimated.  After reading some of the 2 and 3 star reviews I seen others were having the same issues and returned them to Amazon which I did also with in 2 days.  Amazon paid the return postage and promptly refunded my credit card.  I was skeptical about returning and getting my refund but if was good. Ordered a set of Oberwerk 15x60s.  If they don't work I will just go back to some Nikons or Bushnells.
1,What a disappointment! I think you're better off with lighter less powerful Binoculars. I got them for looking at the nighttime sky and looking out my living room window at far off objects but that turned out to be wishful hoping.Trying to hand hold 15X70 Binoculars at anything is impossible. No matter how hard I tried I could never keep the Binoculars steady enough to enjoy what I was trying to look at. There was ALWAYS just enough movement to ruin the view.Oh but wait what about using a tripod to get rid of all that unwanted shake. Trying to look at the moon using these Binoculars with a tripod is like trying to video a car at Indy going by at 200+mph.Binoculars this heavy and powerful are just too much of a hassle to use period. The 15X70 power sounds great but in practice not really useable at least for me.If they had really good $$$stabilization$$$ they might be worth it!
5,These are very good quality.  I don't know much about binoculars so I cannot really get into the nerdy details.  I purchased these for my son who is 10.  They are a bit heavy and he prefers to be able to use them on a stand or rest his elbows on something.  Our younger 6 year old cannot hold them up at all.  As far as quality they are amazing. We have had lots of fun looking at the moon and even Saturn. Yes on a good night you can make out the rings on Saturn!
5,Is amazing to have this is for the see the sky
5,These things are awesome.  They are as good as any $200 or $300 bionculars.  They are awesome to look through.  We live in a mountain town about 400 feet above the city.  At night they are wonderful for looking at the moon or the stars from our deck.  At day they are wonderful for watching wildlife or things down in the city or looking at the mountain peaks. Love the optics and the charity.
3,Two separate complaints:First mine arrived without a tripod adapter. Amazon was quick to refund me the amount necessary to buy the adapter separately but still knocking off a star for that.More importantly my binocs arrived very much in need of collimation and the manual that came with them included no instructions on how (or even if) I could make that adjustment myself. After some googling and YouTube video assistance I found the collimation screws glued under the right hand grip.With those issues resolved the binoculars are not bad but these kind of entry-level astronomy binocs should be usable out of the box.
5,Great binoculars for star gazing and observing wild life.  It's easy to handle but I am probably going to get a sturdier tripod to mount it on.  Currently I have been using my camera tripod and it just does not cut it.  Time for an up grade.
4,Decent piece of gear if you can manage to get one when they go on sale. Does require a tripod tho won't get much of a look without one as the hands will shake making things impossible. Collimation might be an issue as well. I had to rip off the rubber pad on it to adjust the collimation screw.
5,These have high ratings for a reason:  The best binoculars at this price point by far.  BRIGHT image and I am comparing them to several other binoculars monocular and zoom lenses I own.The tripod adapter is very useful but make sure you are using a sturdy tripod.  After trial and error I settled on the Opteka OPT7000 since other tripods seemed to be designed in such a way that allowed an annoying amount of idle sway.  Any little tremor (and I mean just putting your foot on the floor next to it) would cause it to shake for about 1-2 minutes afterwards or just never really stop.
5,I've always wanted a good pair of binoculars without spending a great deal of money. The Celestron Skymaster meets all of my requirements. It's great for stargazing (although we could use more clear skies here in Minnesota during the winter) and is great for birding. You can see all their details close up without scaring them away. I have looked down the highway in front of my place and was actually able to see the faces of people in their vehicles for at least 1/4 mile away. They are easy to adjust and fit my face perfectly. I'm really looking forward to using them on my trip to Arizona in a couple of weeks. You just can't go wrong for the quality and the price!
5,Just got these and I couldn't be happier :-DEasy to handle came with a carry case lense caps and leanse cleaner. I took them out while in my diningroom. Took off the lense caps and looked out the window oh and buy the way very easy to focus and the images were CRYSAL CLEAR  I saw birds flying like I was right next to them. When I put the binoculars down I couldn't see the birds with the naked eye! I know this sound lame to those of you more versed at using binoculars and telescopes but for a lay person like me that was awesome! We're going star gazing at the beach tonight. I LOVE these binoculars!!!!
4,These exceeded my expectations for a budget glass.  I only need these when I go to Arizona because of the 15X.  They're not field portable because of the size.  So they're only really applicable in wide spaces where I have a Jeep and don't need to carry around my neck.You'll need to rest elbows it's not great for quick looks.  It has a tripod attachment which is nice but I haven't tried it.  They dont feel sturdy but I have yet to break them so I won't complain I'll just be careful
4,I purchased this mostly for stargazing and whatnot and haven't been disappointed. The 15x magnification is more than enough to see the moons of Jupiter and disc of the planet. The 70mm lenses gather lots of light and the cloudy surface of Jupiter is washed out because it is too bright. They come with a tripod adapter and you will need it for observations of more than a minute or so because the binoculars are fairly heavy.  You will also want a tripod to hold the binoculars steady because the 15x magnification really accentuates small movements.
5,I gave it to my wife as a gift.  She liked it.
5,These things are huge!  I love them.  They are great for handheld use but really shine when you mount them to a tripod..  PRO TIP: Toss out the plastic tripod mount and purchase a metal version on Amazon for less than $10.  I've been able to see planets at night!  These things are almost as good as using a telescope!
5,I'm all around please with this these. The only reason I rated the image stabilization 4 is because I feel that having a tripod is a must when you order these. That's my fault for not thinking about it. That doesn't mean its a bad product at all! Be sure to get a tripod as well!
5,Great binoculars for the backyard looking at planes birds etc. Good for astronomy. Can see moons of Jupiter pretty well even with the light pollution in LA.
5,I hadn't quite understood how big they would be so I was a little surprised but that's my failure to read and think. As to quality I have nothing but good to say. The glass is clear clear clear. The zoom is smooth. The focus is sharp. They are heavy but you can't have good glass and sturdy mounting gear without a little mass coming along. They are heavy enough that you will want a tripod or even a monopod if you want them to stay still at all. I would buy them again in a heartbeat.
5,I have given the second pair of binoculars a 5.  They are great.  They seem to work well and the views are clear and bright.  The first pair would not focus because the mechanism would not move.  Give Celestron quality control a 1.  I returned the first pair to Amazon and they replaced them at no cost and very quickly.  Give Amazon Customer Service a 5.  I am pleased with the binoculars I got the second time but I would not have started this if I had known what lay ahead.  I may buy another Celestron product but only from Amazon.  You don't get this type of customer service anywhere else.
3,Definitely had to collimate the right lens. Was disappointed in the extra work that had to be done (ripping off the grip and callibrating the lens) and after many hours of trying to collimate I finally got it to work. Used it on a clear night 1 hour west of Washington DC and was definitely amazed.This being my first pair of binoculars I can't compare to the others. Wish I did not have to mess with the lens but a great pair of binoculars nonetheless. Hope other buyers get lucky and get a pair that's perfect out of the box.
3,These binoculars are big.  Big and heavy.  at 15x magnification holding them steady can be a challenge so the tripod mount will I am sure come in handy (not yet tried).The build quality of the binoculars is distinctly average.  I had to tighten up one lens barrel as it was loose.  A glued on piece already seems to be coming off after only having tested them out so please be aware you are not buying a high end pair of binoculars here but something which has a reasonably high magnification with 70mm aperture and a relatively modest cost.Image quality is so-so.  Brightness and contrast (during day viewing) seems okay for whatever is at the centre of the image however towards the edges focus softens.
4,For the price I'm impressed with the product.  I love looking at the moon and stars moons of Jupiter can just be made out.  The optics are decent in the middle but about 50% of the way out from center they diverge focus is off.  It's not terrible but just annoying.  I mostly use them to watch animals from 1/2 to 1 mile away in the hills.  Oh yea they are huge!  Arms get tired trying to hold them up for longer than a couple minutes!
5,These binoculars are a fantastic bargain. They arrived beautifully packaged. Iâm impressed with the quality construction and sturdiness. Focusing adjustments are easily made and focusing wheels are firm. Itâs very easy to use with or without a tripod. Very clear optics day or night. Iâm very happy with this item and am so glad I got the 15x70 version as itâs not too heavy and itâs very versatile.
5,What a wonderful pair of binoculars! After following the easy instructions for personal focus settings I was able quickly to spot the first two deep-sky objects I looked for. The Orion Nebula was still kinda hazy but there was lots of ambient light where I was observing---Pleiades was as crisp and clear as the Fort Wayne night. Aldebaran glared at me and filled most of my field of view as I scanned the Milky Way for Santa and his reindeer...it was Christmas eve after all.:)$50.00 is a paltry amount for this quality. The money saved can be used for the tripod that is needed; the one draw back is the weight the binos are hard to keep steady.
5,... a decent pair of 15x70 binoculars is EXPENSIVE. These were about $65 including a case and an adapter for a camera tripod. Not the greatest optics but I've got them sitting in my office window where they're just excellent for looking at the boats outside. (I really want a pair of US Navy "big eyes" but those are just outrageous.)The tripod adapter should be metal - the thing is plastic and a bit flimsy given the mass of the binoculars. If I tweak it hard it will probably snap. In installation instructions are a bit hazy; you have to be brave and pop that cap off the outer end of the shaft to mount the adapter.
5,Mainly bought it to stargaze.  I am highly impressed.  It opens up God's creation.  I did not realize how many stars could be visible with the right binoculars.  These are the ticket.  Don't bother with cheaper binos.  I have used cheaper $40 binos and they don't even compare to these SkyMasters.  A tripod will be helpful to help keep things still.  I am impressed with these binoculars.  I bought one for myself and my 12 year old and he loves his too.
3,I bought three of these binoculars because I found them on a terrific sale. Out of three one was decent one was useable and one was returned. The units are cheaply made they are large heavy a bit unwieldy and the culmination is iffy. I find myself closing one eye when using these because the images are not aligned well. In other words the culmination is poor. The lenses seem to be good and the light sensitivity is great as it should be with 70 mm objectives and only 15 power. Amazon's return policy works well so if you buy these know that you can return them if you get a pair that do not work right.
5,Ok these are not expensive and therefore not the best optics. That said for the money there really do zoom things in.  I can only imagine how much a good pair of this power would cost so unless you have lots of money and a strong need for the best. I think these are great for occasional star or planet watching and zooming in on distant object.
4,Really nice to have. I tried larger magnification telescope for $200 but found it disappointing for it was very time consuming to find stuff in the night sky due to its small field of view. I think I need really expensive telescope to be satisfied. But this binoculars is great! Really easy to find stuff due to its wide field and the quality is fine for amateur like me. No I can't see the rings of Saturn but it's really fun and easy for lugging around and seeing stuff day and night.
4,Respectable clarity comfort user friendliness. Substantial weight but probably to be expected.
3,This product is not that great as most people review. the Tripod adaptor was broken upon very first installation. I purchased it directly from Amazon arrive promptly with nice package. But remember this is MADE  IN  CHINA and the materials are not that great.I did not return it back although the tripod adaptor is broken upon first attachment (screwing) onto the body then to Tripod. the binocular is just fine. Very hard to set focus for both eye pieces. Adjustment can be done only 1 side. There is no explanation of it about that eyepiece adjustment - that we can do only 1 side.  But the brand name Celestron make me buy this binocular set.
5,I know little about optics nothing about astronomy and havenât owned binos since I was boy scout age. These are heavy and gigantic the image is bright and clear. Things three blocks away appear as if theyâre in my yard at a starfield layer appears that Iâd never seen unaided. Lens covers could be improved but the included carry bag is very well made.
4,These were a great purchase. Mine came collimated just fine.  I was surprised how lite they are for their size. I can hand hold them just fine for short periods.  The only things that needs changing is better retention of the eyepiece covers and they need to send a metal tripod attachment.  I had to replace the tripod adapter with a metal one to make it functional to use on a tripod.
5,I am interested in astronomy and I also work as a night time security guard. I wanted something that could handle both. The Skymaster is great for viewing the moon or spotting distant objects in the sky. It does require a tripod (the tripod adapter is included) for sky viewing but they are easy to set up. On the job I work at a interstate rest stop and I can be on one side of the interstate and watch the other side as well. The light gathering qualities allow good low light viewing. At nighttime and even in darker areas I can easily see what's going on.
4,These are great binoculars and nicely priced. They have a good field of view and magnification. They are easy to focus and grasp. They do get heavy after long viewing periods but they come with an adapter for use with a tripod.
5,I've been using them for general star viewing. i love them. i'm probably going to have them for the rest of my life as long as I don't drop them or anything. I can barely make out Saturn's rings. I can see Jupiter and its moons fairly well. The moon looks amazing nearly blinding also. They have a very sharp crisp image and are great quality. I'm not dissapointed at all. The tripod mount is also very very handy! I'll set these up with my Celestron Astromaster 130eq and the difference is almost uncanny. If I could hook up my camera to these they would easily replace my full size telescope.
5,a bit hefty but they work great
4,Good binoculars but not practical for star gazing without a tripod
5,These are great binoculars good construction smooth focuser coated lenses and sharp images. There is some slight chromatic aberration however. It's not very strong but you can see that it's there. Also expect it to be bigger than regular binoculars but it's not heavy at all. Overall I thought they were very good binoculars.Note that this model does not have zoom.
4,The binocular was great I think.  The left lens was disengaged upon my receipt.  Thus it didn't work.  Ist. time this has happen in over dozens of shipments.  One is taking a chance having a lens device delivered. Packages are thrown around by carriers. I know this for a fact!  Replacement by Amazon was made easy.
5,Buen producto cumple con las espectativas
5,I bought this to check out the skies and for that it is a lot of fun (so much so that I bought a telescope to go further). As a pair of traditional binocs I was blown away.  These are very large so they're not great for lugging to sporting events or casual sightseeing but other than that take them with you.  I later took these on a trip to Yellowstone and they were quite a hit with my brother and his family.  I got him a pair for his birthday.  These will knock your socks off.  Great price for the quality you are getting from the world-class brand of optics of Celestron.
5,My old 7x35s are heavier than this thing. I would not have a problem hiking with these since they are a lot more light weight than I thought they'd be. You can hand hold them for short periods but because of the high magnification its best to use a tripod anyway. We got a really clear view of comet Pan-stars the other night. These will get used a lot. My only quibble is with the tripod adapter- it is made of some flimsy plastic and it takes a few seconds for the binoculars to stabilize after locking down the tripod. I'm gonna try to reinforce it somehow and see if that helps. Solid metal would be a lot better.
5,Great job on your side! Thanks much
3,When we bought these we had no idea it would take 2 weeks before they would get shipped once shipped we got our in just days BUT the left lens had dust on the inside barrel and on the inside of the lens (with some smearing taboot). There was some green fringing at all ranges of use and this horrible ability to make us go cross eyed BUT for 15x and 70mm lenses they do quiet well in most lighting situations after your eyes come to terms with them that is. I personally think the manufacture was in a hurry to build these and skimped on the usual quality control or the company is simply going down hill but I rather give them the benefit of the doubt and we just got a beat up pair.
5,Excellent buy for these binoculars! Image is very clear and bright! Very good construction with hard rubber coating all over. I don't think most people realize what a great buy these are for the money. Nowadays if you spend less you usually get what you pay for and that's not usually very good quality. But for a mere $59.95 i'm blown away with these Celestron 15x70 Binoculars! 20 years ago something like this would have cost you a lot more. I had no problems of any kind when i received these from amazon. Everything was perfect! Thanks amazon you make living a whole lot better!!!!
4,We like the Nikon 8 x 42 better.  The tripod attachment is too flimsy to keep the binoculars from shaking.  We ordered a better tripod attachment.  The carrying case is a bit flimsy as well.  We have not had these long.  Plan a trip to the desert to give them a better chance than what we have experienced in the city.
5,I purchased these to stargaze. It was recommended that amateurs get a good set of binoculars at first since telescopes are expensive and sometimes difficult. I was glad I bought these instead of a telescope. Saturn was able to be seen with the naked eye shortly after my purchase. I got these focused and could actually make out the rings. They were blurry of course and I had to be very very still. I ended up buying a cheap tripod which helped some. These are best for getting a closer look at constellations seeing stars that can't be seen with the naked eye seeing some details of the moon and getting a closer look at nature. Great for birdwatching!
5,I purchased these for astronomy purposes and they have worked great. They are perfect for viewing objects that require a wider field of view such as the Andromeda Galaxy and the Pleiades. I have had no trouble with these at all. The only downside is that they are a bit heavy but I was aware of this when I purchased them. They come with an adapter and are easily placed on a tripod so the weight really is not an issue. These are perfect for viewing the night sky especially on those occasions where you are travelling or don't feel like setting up a telescope. These would be a perfect way to introduce someone to the hobby of Astronomy.
3,the problem with any binocular is the necessity to keep the two eyepieces absolutely parallel or you see two slightly offset images. The binocs have a long lense reach and so the case tends to flex a bit causing the double image. A slight twisting with hands on each side can realign them but a high quality set would not need that. Not worth the cost of returning for a different pair so will try a rigid support of some sort. otherwise a nice clear image. Hard to describe how annoying the double image is though.
1,A friend had a pair of these Skymasters and they were great for a cheap pair of binos so I bought this same model in 2016 tried them out and had a horrible experience with alignment ghosted double vision. Checked focusing and never could achieve sharp focus on left side as compared to right side. Not a newbie error on not understanding the proper way of focusing and diopter use. The left side was always softer in focus no matter which eye or who tried  them. I put them away and never used them I don't know why I didn't return them. FFWD to 2020 and the comet NEOWISE. I am too lazy to get out the 100 lb LX200 but want more magnification than my 10x42's  I think about that pair of Skymasters I find it in the closet  looking still shiny and new. I take it out and nope it didn't magically get better. Back into the closet it goes if not in the trash...
5,I researched these binoculars prior to purchasing and nearly everyone raved about them.  I remained cautions mainly due to the price but ordered anyway as I didn't have much to lose.  Holy cow!!  These binocs are TACK SHARP and I cannot believe they are selling at this price.  I have used them only for astronomical viewing no terrestrial use.  My only complaint is that the plastic tripod mount is worthless as it is too flexible and takes too long for vibrations to damp.  I use another 1/4" thick angle aluminum tripod mount on a very heavy Boden tripod and they are rock solid.  I'm a believer and highly recommend these.
4,My guy loved this and he is 32! We've had picnics at night looking at the stars and on the beach. Can't wait to take it to the desert! I did tons of research before buying these and i would say they are great for a beginner. The moon is incredible and the Orion Nebula is so cool. That's pretty much it. Cant see many things for this price which is what I was hoping. But I'm just being a cheap-o.
5,This was a present for my daughter. She really likes it.
5,I wanted binoculars that were strong enough to stargaze but that still could be used for terrestrial viewing and I love these. Everything looks crisp and clear and the magnification is awesome. They are quite heavy and work best if you can rest your elbows on something but I have never used them with a tripod. I take these on day hikes although I think most people would be better off with something smaller if you just want them for hiking.
5,I'm only beginning to get interested in astronomy. I've had a beginners telescope before that lost my interest very quickly. This is very easy to use and seems to be quite high quality however. Simple set up allows me to look at the moon and other objects very very quickly. However this is not a device that will allow you good views of the planets. This is spectacular for the moon and general constellations but for more you need more
5,I bought these to view the airplanes as they passed overhead at 25000 feet. I can make out the engines and also the colors of the plane and tail easily. Great also for viewing the moon and celestial bodies. Very impressed with the binoculars. They are a little hard to keep steady but by placing your hands at the far ends you can follow the planes easily and with the wide field of view you can keep up with the planes as they fly 525mph. Also while scanning the sky have found planes that were not in view with naked eye as there was no vapor trail. Would definitely recommend.
5,I can see incredible detail of our moon with these 15x70's.  While viewing the 5 bright planets alignment this year  I also enjoyed seeing the 4 moons of Jupiter and can just barely see the ring around Saturn!  The high magnification of these binoculars require a tripod for a clear non-blurry view because our hands shake even though it doesn't look like it.  I love these!  They are my "first telescope" and so easy and lightweight to use!  Fun to grab and go!
4,Like many other reviewers it took multiple attempts to get a decent pair from Amazon. The first pair I received was clearly used with multiple issues but the collimation was perfect. The second pair was brand new but horrible double vision. The third pair also brand new had acceptable collimation. For what you pay this is a great pair of binoculars.View of the moon are outstanding and even the moons of Jupiter are visible. My favorite so far is terrestrial viewing. I really enjoy the 15x zoom.
4,Got these as a lightening deal.  For the price the quality is great.  We have a roof top deck over looking an amusement park and marina.  It stays sharp and in focus.  I would recommend these highly for birders or marine if not too wet. Distance focusing is good but not what we were really hoping for but I think its our misunderstanding of optics.
5,They are pretty big. Not something you could tote in your purse. Comes with its own case tho. Very surprised at the quality and clarity.
4,Very clear and nice picture of the skies. However the instrument is very heavy and you have to invest in a tripod to use it. So it is a bit unconvenient when you go hiking.
3,Regrettably the first unit I bought was defective (collimation error).  I returned it and ordered a replacement and that too was defective (same error).  Only on the third one and second replacement unit did I get a pair in working order.  I'm afraid that's completely unacceptable quality control on the part of Celestron (although it's not Amazon's fault).Now that I have a working pair they're fine and I look forward to using them for bird-watching viewing ships off the coast and other such activities.  However the bad experiences with the first two pairs have left a nasty taste in my mouth so to speak.
2,As the title says it. Arrived with Celestron outer box unsealed and folded shut (so returned item? warning sign #1). When I first attempted to separate the tubes one of them started to unscrew (warning sign #2). Looking through there was the dreaded double image indicating lack of collimation. It fixed itself when I tilted my head left by 90 degrees -- obviously not an ideal remedy! While it's possible to collimate them it would require to rip out the tightly glued rubber grip (to reveal adjustment screws) so I returned the item instead.Also while the center was really sharp I could tell the periphery was noticeably softer. I don't know how bad this would be for star-gazing in practice. Looks like I got the statistically inevitable lemon. Not nice if it had been previously returned and the retailer just repackaged it especially as I'm leaving town tomorrow and won't have the chance to receive a replacement on time.Positives: Good magnification sharp in the center reasonably lightweight.
5,I am an experienced amateur astronomer and know optical instruments.  I was pleasantly surprised by the excellent build and optical quality of this product. I salute to Celestron for be able to deliver such a good product for so little cost in this day and age.  I had a old pair of Minolta 10X50 to compare this to and the difference was immediately obvious.  The image focus area across the field of view was larger and clearer. The binos are easy to adjust and they surprisingly lightweight considering their size.  I highly recommend these if you don't need if your pocket book is tight.
5,I received them yesterday tried them at once and was stunned by their build quality as well as clarity of vision.However by their nature they are heavy and need a tripod even on a tripod they shake a little. In my experience with them and the price paid ($57) they are unbeatable. For terrestrial viewing they beat my Meade 200LX telescope which I use with an Orion Q70  eyepiece in clarity and detail.My advice is to buy them and  mount it on an unused photo tripod permanently.  I am still trying to  understand how  such an incredible piece of technology can be as inexpensive as a family lunch at McDonalds.
5,This should be the first purchase for those new to astronomy.Has a wide viewrange and good light collection which lets you see constellations in their entirety instead of a small section as with a telescope.Light weight and easy to transport.Good sturdy and light design.The only drawback is that the included tripod adapter is flimsy upgrade to the metal model right away.Get the tallest tripod you can find to go along with it.Provides nice view of the moon constellations and sometimes planets.
5,My grand kids love this as much as I do. With a stand and adapter for phone you can take pictures of the moon or anything else you can see.This lets you see it on your phone or camera by several people at once. It works best if you can rest it on top of something when holding it. It is 4.5 pounds so can get heavy after using for awhile. Lay on your back works great to while using to. Worth every penny I paid for it and more.
5,We have a pair of these at home and at our lake home. We just bought a third pair for our son-in-law. They are great for daytime use as well as night. Not ones you would want to hike with but great for wildlife etc viewing.
2,Iâve tried to get these to work for a year. Admittedly  only on occasion. Definitely not a hand held set. Tripod or mount or something is very needed at the magnification these have. Problem is I always end up just using one side because I can never get it together and sharp. Even when using only one it really isnât tack sharp. It never can really get dead on focus no matter how much I adjust them. My recommendation is to not fiddle with these and get a set that actually give a sharp image.
4,Love these for stargazing although I have had to adjust the prizm screws to get a perfectly lined up image. I still would not trade these. The tripod mount is plastic and because of this it's useless. Bumping the binoculars causes severe shaking that's so annoying. But an aluminum mount can be purchased which makes everything perfect again. Would recommend.
4,I had one last week.. first use in terrestrial view it was so good .. clear and bright then I surprised when observing the moon.. sharp and bright also you feel the 3D..I strongly recommended for beginners..my only notes are :1- You have to rest your arm every minuet.. because its weight.2- The instruction for Focusing is not clear in the manual .. you should find some way to catch that..I am really happy with my 1st Binocular..
4,Probably best bang for your buck for skywatching. My first pair was out of collimation so I returned it. Second time they are great.One big problem is the supplied trips mount is horrible and shakes a lot but I solved that problem by filling receded parts of the mount with jbweld and it became much sturdier. See pictures of tripod mount after epoxy
5,This has been incredible for star gazing itâs easy enough to handle for letting the kids use as well. It is a little heavy so I would suggest a tripod. Itâs perfect for amateur star gazers just starting to learn the night sky.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                Â I love this bino.  It worked well.  I took images and videos using my Samsung Note 3 smartphone camera and this bino on Super-moon day.  Binos was super-sensitive and not easy to control.  I did use a tripod when taking photos and videos.  However it was also great to hold it with both hands to see stars.  My friends and I got no issues at all.  Recommend it.
4,We just wanted a nice pair of binoculars to use at our cabin and watch boats go by.These are great for the price and do a fine job.They really are quite large and so for us are good for sitting on the table on the deck and using for boat or bird spotting in the immediate area but I would not suggest you would want o walk around with them for too long as could become quite heavy.
5,Clear crisp images. Get a tripod though they get heavy after awhile.
4,I am a bird watcher and appreciate having a nice set of binoculars to check in on things in the woods out my back door.  These are very nice for the price.  Range is a little narrow - not the binoculars' fault - which takes some getting used to and the "strap" is not really a real strap...more an afterthought.  All that being said they mounted easily on my tripod and are easy to adjust and focus.  A nice buy for the money.
5,These are magnificent binoculars for the price; clear and crisp images nice contrast sturdy form excellent light gathering etc. The one problem is that my pair was shipped out of collimation (images from both eyepieces don't line up perfectly causing double vision). There are many reviews addressing this issue. Fortunately for me my pair seems to have cured itself as the problem has gone away after about a week of use. I'm a beginner when it comes to using binoculars like these so I'm not sure if this is of the norm or not but nonetheless I'm happy the image has been fixed. These binoculars are a no brainer for the price! Excellent buy!
4,Bought these for a trip to Yellowstone.  They provide great magnification and have a nice feel.  They work well for terrestrial viewing as well as astronomical viewing.  I have connected these to a tripod to help steady them for better viewing.  If you have steady hands you don't need the tripod but it is helpful..
4,Ease of use. Brings viewed items up-close and personal. Flimsy case. Recommend purchase of available hard case.
5,Great binoculars for the price. Used them and could see moon and craters
4,Absolutely great.  Only very slightly out of colmnation.  Perfect for intended purpose of scanning star clusters.  Orion Nebula is very good in these on a winter night.  Resolves large planets OK.  I would assume good for mountain and bird watching too.
5,Fantastic binoculars!! I own multiple sets of binoculars and also a high powered newtonian telescope but these are my favorite tools for viewing the night sky.  The Andromeda galaxy is clearly visible in these binoculars as well as many other celestial objects.  The Pleiades star cluster in the eastern San Diego sky is another amazing sight to see through these binoculars.  Great product for the price.  I was skeptical at first but these are by far worth their price.  Good job Celestron keep it up.
4,These binoculars are everything they are advertised to be.  Very strong.  Very powerful.  Unfortunately also very big.  Too heavy to use for any period of time without a tripod and certainly not the kind of binoculars to carry around all day.  But since they come with a tripod adapter and are advertised as sky gazing binoculars I shouldn't be surprised.  We are very happy with the product.  Our expectations were just for a smaller piece of hardware.
5,This set of glass is really nice for under fifty bucks.  Wow what a find. The tripod accessory is a great add in as well. It screws in on the bottom of the focus adjustment so the binocs balance well on a mono pod or tripod  I connected it to a mono pod with a ball head and it made the view quite stable.  A tripod would be even better. The optics are crisp and clean.  Both adjustments sync quite easily. The top eye piece rubber are comfortable and the eyepiece cover has d ring to connect it to the neck strap.  Again great bang for the buck.
5,I love this product I am still using it and it's in great condition after a these few years!!
4,Great value. The bang for your buck is definitely there. The optics are very good for the price point. I have used for viewing the moon but mostly use for long range land viewing. They are somewhat usable without a tripod but highly recommend a tripod.  They are a bit heavy for general use and you will find your hands/arms shaking making it hard to view at such lengths.
4,Nice binoculars. Moon looks great through them. You're kidding yourself if you think you will see much beyond that. Comes with attachment for mounting on a tripod however the knob broke off of mine when I was tightening it down. Mounting bracket is made of cheap plastic but I really like the binoculars.
5,Excellent set of binoculars - these are fantastic for distant viewing and i mean excellent - Balancing on a stable surface for stable viewing due to the power of these - its like holding a telescope its that great! I placed my camera with 20X zoom in front of it and got a FANTASTIC picture of the moon you would think you had taken it with a $1000 telescope - the detail is unreal! They are heavy and well built! We bought 2 of them at $49/ea. - a real super great buy!
4,The ability to stabilize is difficult. The functions for viewing the sky are great!
3,Mine came out of alignment and Ive yet to be able to fix them but I never return anything so it is what it is.  The quality if you only look thru one is eye is actually quite good.  If you have something to rest these on you can get a very nice view.  I bought a tripod for them but found I can manage ok without it and prefer to not use the tripod.  They are heavy for most people though so if you don't work out you may want to order a tripod or find something to rest them on for extended viewing.
4,Certainly worth what I paid. I have binoculars with greater clarity across the full field of view but I also paid a significant sum for that additional clarity. They did have a culmination problem right out of the box but it was fairly simple to culminate. My kids and I were able to see three of Jupiter's moons last night. Great fun for a great price.
5,These binoculars are AMAZING! I bought them for my dad after he had surgery. I knew it would be too difficult for him to set up his telescope constantly to do his star gazing and wanted a great pair of binoculars that he could easily hold with ease. These went above and beyond! Once he started feeling better he even made a swivel stand for them. I was amazed at how crisp and clear the moon came through with these when I tried them out. It's a must have for star fanatics!
4,These binoculars are great. They are a good price for under $65 I paid.There is a slightly higher power for almost twice as much.If you get these consider getting a tripod for long term viewing or spotting. They are a little heavy considering their optics.But they are great for watching deer and other animals from a deck or other short term spotting. Might not be practical for hunting in brushy areas or to lug around for hours.
5,They work like a charm...ð
5,This is my first pair of binoculars.  I am impressed once I got the pupil to pupil width correct (REAL EASY) I have had a blast.  I'm going to get a good tripod for star gazing.  This was a drop ship and it packing and shipping time was excellent. Last night at dusk I was following a chem-trail in the sky west of Charlotte.  With my naked eye I was unable to see anything but the plane discharge with the binoculars I could see the plane and nav lights.  That was great.
3,I knew this was a large item and would be hard to hold steady but I alreay had a tripod for it .  The price was good .  But all the reviews I read said all the things you could see with these and all I can see is just large bright spots . It's just like without them but bigger dots in the sky with them !  You see a bright object in the sky and then you look through your binoculars and you just see a bigger image of the bright object  no detail looks just the same only bigger.I would not have gotten these had I known  but I went by the reviews.

5,I got this only few hours back and i liked the quality .Just for test i was viewing the mountains and to my surprise i could see a chopper through binocular and when i took it off i couldn't see chopper anywhere.Its 15X70 has awesome view . Haven't tried in night sky yet hope it will be good.I brought this mainly for star gazing.Build quality is very good and has a good grip.The only con would be that its extremely heavy . Almost as heavy as my laptop.This is my first binocular and i really liked it .Its worth the price .
5,great price for these binoculars. Excellent quality and very crisp image. Love the viewing distance. I can read the numbers on the electric pole 300 yrds away like it is right in front of me.
5,Sure it's not a telescope but my 5 & 7 year old love using these binoculars. Not just for the stars but for everything else. Trips hikes or just laying back in our yard this is a fun toy to have. The quality impressed me also super sharp and clear images and even brightens up things in the shade/shadows during daylight use. We now even enjoy seeing all the jets cruising at 40000 feet with the white streams in the background. I highly recommend this item to get kids interested in astronomy. In a couple of years if the interest is there then we can invest into a telescope.
4,These binos for the price are quite acceptable.There were purchased primarily for astronomical use though I wasn't about to purchase Fujicon or one of the more expensive makers.Thus far I've only looked at the moon a few clusters and attempted to see how far I could read auto licenses (abaout 5 blocks away).I'll be taking them to a dark sky soon and should know more.As for the moon the views were truly wonderful.They do need a tripod.
5,We are greatly enjoying our new binoculars. We are new stargazers and were a bit  concerned that the binoculars would not be strong enough to actually be of value.  But they are great.  We really used them on a recent camping trip to the California Redwoods.  So many stars were easily recognizable. They are not too heavy yet bring the stars "up close and personal."  We used them most and enjoyed them best on a lightweight tripod.  They attach easily to the Vista Explorer 60-inch Lightweight Tripod.  Both the binoculars and tripod conveniently come in their own case.
5,I bought these to use at the shooting range as a "spotting scope" because of the 15 power.  They are much better out to 200 yards that the 10 power that I was using.  They have to be used on a tripod or rested on shooting bags for clarity.I also use them at night as I live in a desert area with little light pollution and usually clear skies.They are much better than the naked eye for that but I don't have anything else to compare them to for that use.
4,They are a good pair. Works well for observations at 75' and farther. Works well for the moon. Havent had a shot to get a quick look at a planet yet (if possibly)
4,Haven't even received this purchase yet but was hesitant to buy due to some buyers commenting that their units were "out of collimation" although most reviewers didn't have that problem. After googling for an answer to this anticipated problem I found the below hyperlink which has put my mind at ease. If mine turns out to have the problem the below link will work for me. If you are a "tweaker" - problem solved.[...]
5,Easy to handle and gives a great view of the night sky. Light enough for an average man to hold in hands and view during the day but for night viewing of far off objects you need a tripod to steady the image. It's light enough so that you can get away with using a basic inexpensive tripod. I got the AmazonBasics 60-Inch Lightweight Tripod and it makes for a great set up.PS: I read that the included tripod adapter is cheap. Maybe so but it works fine.
5,Great binoculars.  Easy to focus and use.  Be aware that these are heavy and are best used with a tripod for stabilizing.  Amazing the number of stars you can see with these.  And while not as powerful as our telescope....you can still see the ridges of the moon.  I suspect they would be great to use in the field.
5,A friend of mine has been carrying his super expensive binoculars around at night and we always love looking at the craters of the moon through them. It made me want a pair and these were what i wanted. I can see the craters even more clearly through these than my friends expensive vortex binoculars and these are MUCH more affordable!
4,A little heavy and thought Iâd see more than I can.
3,Bought these 8 yrs ago went to use them tonight and the rubber has become so sticky it renders them pretty much unusable. I have seen this same issue on other bargin optics. Donât know what material it is but it is junk. Buy these knowing the short lifespan you wonât own them for too long. The optics still are fine but the low quality rubber has destroyed them.
4,The image quality of this product was very good .  The only issue I had is the mounting peas for the tripod connection .  When you put it on a tripod or mono pod it swivels and it's hard to control .  There doesn't seem to be a way to have a tight connection
5,These work great ! Very happy I didn't spend much more for other higher rated ones . These are great .At the same time I bought a pair of YOY 20x50 and they suck compared to these 15x70 .The yoys aren't even as good as my 20 yr old Bushnell 10x50 .
5,Well built excellent optics. Comes with mount for a tripod so you can have it slightly raise.
4,These are excellent (albeit heavy)precision optics. The only reason I didn't rate 5 stars is because I had to collimate them. If you don't know how to collimate binoculars it is easy. Underneath the rubber hand hold is a screw. You have to turn the screw until the images converge together into one image. Aside from that a great buy. Your gonna need a tripod.
4,As others have mentioned it is a bit tricky to focus these binoculars.  They are pretty awesome though!  Once you develop a steady stance and zero in the focus you can get a good look at wildlife and creep on your neighbors.  The seems to lack some sharpness but I am not that experienced with binoculars so this may be normal.
5,Totally love these binoculars. Bought this as a gift for my husband although I use it more! Great for night sky watching. It does show dark spots while viewing at times which can be corrected by bringing the eyepieces closer. Atleast it works for me. Slightly on the heavier side so mounting on a tripod would be more convenient.
5,Great product. It should be used with tripod for better experience. Excellent and mage quality and easy to adjust. Recommended for amateur astronomy for astronomy but also gets great terrestrial views.
5,These are very powerful glasses that perform well even in low light conditions. Their main advantage over a spotting scope is their ability to provide a way to assess the relationship between objects within the field of view. You can determine which object is close and which is further away. Definately should use the tripod adapter. A short tripod will help when you're travelling and can be set up on the roof or hood of a car to steady the image. These are difficult to hand hold due to their higher magnification. Highly recommended and of very good quality. These are not cheaply made!
4,these binoculars wasnt what i was expecting thought i would be able to see a lil more then stars and just the moonbut maybe cause im in a very bright city ( NYC ) but other wise there just a lil bit heavy but thats about it thats why im rating it a 4 . but they are really worth the money and are good built and was able to experience  some shooting stars :)
5,I have hip arthritis and had to stop using my telescopes for viewing objects in the night sky. These binoculars coupled with my new zero gravity chair (for steady viewing) allow me to see lots of objects I used to only see in my telescopes. The 15x is large enough to recognize what I'm looking at and the 70mm lenses give me good light gathering power which is essential for looking at faint objects.I can enjoy astronomy once again. I love these binoculars!
2,Other good: much lighter than expected for size but I will still need at least a monopod to use effectively but only because 15x is a bit high to freehand so NOT a negative.The retail box was packed tight against the bottom of the shipping box perhaps it had some shocks in transit though there was no damage to any of the packing.Overall very very pleased by quality of the optics in each ocular but no matter how I hold or adjust the spacing I still get views that don't align. NOTE: I wear glasses and have a strong astigmatism so maybe I'm being too quick to squawk? I'm quite the newbie here but I've not had this problem with other (cheap terrestrial) binoculars I've used.I did not expect the binoculars to need collimation right out of the box.  I suppose if I'm going to practice collimating it is better to begin with an inexpensive set than an expensive one but I'm a bit disappointed none the less. Hence the 2 stars instead of 4 or 5.
5,My dad had been using the same small old binoculars that he has owned for years.  I wanted to buy him a new pair for Christmas but I didn't know much about them.  I recognized the Celestron name so took a chance on this inexpensive pair.First they are huge which is what I wanted.  The lenses are flawless as far as I can tell and the focus is sharp and crisp.  Because of the size you'll want to either brace them against something or use a tripod with the included adapter.A fantastic deal in my opinion for ~$50.
5,Gives a great night view of the moon's craters or of critters playing about in the day. The left lens focuses separately from the right and this is the first set of binoculars I have owned that do that so it is the first set I have owned that work for my eyes. The rubber cups fold down very easily for using them with glasses and fold back up just as easily to pass them to someone without glasses. The tripod adapter they come with works perfectly. Highly recommend the tripod for use with viewing stars and planets.
4,purchased these 15x70 w/ high hopes of moon and planet viewing as the 70mm lens seemed a powerful light gathering tool along w/ the 15 magnification. However they don't seem to view any better than my 50mm Nikons. you can see the popular Orion nebula but I'd hoped for the rings of Saturn and better distinction of Jupiter. Maybe better as Summer comes along. They are about the same as the 70mm Celestron scope.
3,These binocs are so heavy without a tripod that I couldn't hold them still.
5,These things were fantastic spotting wildlife in a Yellowstone trip this past summer. We were able to see an incredible distance not only for the wildlife enjoyment but the beautiful scenery.
4,I bought it from Amazon for kids. The price is very tempting given the spec and those positive reviews.Pros:(1). Optics quality is high. Very sharp and clean view of field;(2). It's very easy to use it for star watching at night... much much more easier than using a telescope;(3). The soft rubber protection around the eyepieces is very considerate;Cons:  It is too heavy for kids. So we always use a tripod.
5,I must have gotten a good pair. The optics are dead on and clear. Lighter than I expected too.I suppose my only complaint is that they don't fit snugly on MY tripod. Tripod is a must for night viewing yes lighter than expected but  still a tad heavy for steady viewing.Can't beat them at this price point. Sure you can get better binoculars from Nikon et al but not at this entry level astronomy price.
5,These were for my husband and he canât stop talking about how great they are.
5,An excellent product!  The first time I looked thru this I happened to be focused on a cat sneaking thru high weeds at least 1000 feet away and the picture was perfectly clear.  Later I pointed them at the full moon and was captivated by the clear beautiful picture!  Since I was holding them in my hands the picture wasn't very steady so I immediately ordered the tripod for it. The only drawback to these binocs is the weight but the quality is worth it.
5,These are much better than the cheap binoculars we had. I have used these to spy on neighbors watch birds and other critters from a safe distance and even check out divers and snorkelers in the water across from our place. But I can't stop my hand from shaking when holding them. It's not like I have Atkinson's disease it's just the normal everyday shaking that we all do. This definitely needs a tripod to get a steady view but they work well enough to see detail if you can manage to keep them still long enough.
5,It was delivered before the scheduled. Great binoculars. However I do suggest buying a tripod. It is difficult to hold in a stable position using hands.
5,I did tons of research as I was looking for a telescope for my 6 year old for Christmas as he wanted to view the stars.  Most sites and friends stated to start out with binoculars first as they are mobile and focus easier for astronomers in training.  They are a bit heavy for him but I feel much better with the strap attached so he doesn't accidentally drop them.  So far he loves them and is waiting for a clear night to try them out.Would recommend
2,Just OK. As others have mentioned collimation was off so much that the double images appears inches apart in the field of view! I bought Celestron as a known brand and expected way better quality out of the box. On a side note I bought these for a friend as an introduction to astronomy. You will need to either A.) buy a real mount and a sturdy 6 ft tripod or B.) buy a smaller lighter weight set of binoculars or C.) just go right for a real telescope. The mount that comes with the binoculars is way to flimsy to support the weight of the binoculars without lots of jiggling of the image. Trying to support these binoculars up against your eyes without bracing against a solid object will only be frustrating when trying to focus in on an image.
4,I purchased these Binocculars to view wild game.  I am too shakey to just hold them so I had to get a tripod which helped but the field of view is small. they are good binocs but wouldn't buy them again/ they would probley be good for looking at stars but I don't do that.
5,I bought this product specifically for stargazing.  By holding these in my hands I can tell that these binoculars are high quality.  Great price.The only thing I would recommend is that if you don't have the steady hands of a professional photographer that you buy yourself a tripod because (for me) it is very difficult to hold them steady enough to actually enjoy what I'm looking at.  This isn't the products fault at all...  anything else with this level of magnification would be difficult to hold steady... unless it was some kind of automated device like an electronic telescope.
5,This makes a great instant alternate to my 18 inch Dobsonian telescope when I am not sure if the sky is worth the 10 minute telescope setup. (and compared to the 80-pound telescope much more portable)Great on a tripod - yes it does oscillate interminably - but see my uploaded customser image for an easy way to stabilize it with its own neck strap. (My Vanguard tripod works great; which I bought for its smooth panning ability)Incredible value for the money. Mine came pretty well aligned but if it hadn't been I would have had the factory fix the alignment.
3,Way too heavy doesnât include a movable device thatâs shown in the instructions
5,great binoculars.  I had a star-gazing party of 1 with a Nexstar 8SE a Cosmos 90GT and these and I got the most stars per view with these.  Of course I thing the fact that when you are looking through binos you can use both eyes helped.  They are a little heavy for weaker people like me so I have them on a tripod.  It takes a little getting used to but I am very happy with these.
5,These are great and have opened up a whole new world.  The distance and clarity are amazing.  As can be seen in the listing they are large and are probably too heavy to look through for long periods of time without a tripod. I haven't tried that yet.  I can hold them steady up to my eyes without a problem or rest my elbow on a chair arm for longer looks.  If you want a crystal clear view of what's going on really far away these will do the job.
3,Nice but be aware these are a lot heavier than standard binoculars. I could not hold them steady. You need a tripod or really strong arms.
5,Great image but holding them steady without a tripod is difficult.  They are not light but not too heavy.
4,Good clarity. Good quality. Just as I expected. I feel like they should cost more than they do and so does everyone else who comes in my office to check them out.
5,Wow this is a serious set of Binoculars. I live on a very wide stretch of the Potomac River as it flows into the Chesapeake Bay and have a great time checking out boats many miles away. Haven't used them for celestial viewing yet. Also bought a set for my Grand Kids in Seattle and they are having a ball looking at the Moon and mountains.  Only draw back is that they are really heavy and I think that the tripod is necessary.
2,Binoculars got de-collimated shortly after receiving them.  Past the point of 30-day warranty.  Company asks for a boatload to recollimate.  Searching the web brings up a lot of similar issues thus makes me question the quality control of these premium priced binocs.
5,Binoculars are great. The attachment that holds to a tripod though is not sturdy enough and gives a shaky picture which is what a tripod is supposed to correct.
5,Excelente producto
5,A great price. Had to order a replacement since the first set arrived with the optics out of whack. Amazon was quick to replace. Hassle free return with ample time to return the defective set. Seems well built. Have only had a few clear nights to view since purchase. Nice clear view of the Orion Constellation The Aladerbaran Cluster and the Pleiades For the price you can't beat the greater detail you get in watching the night sky.The only con is the size making prolonged viewings difficult.
5,Perfect optics! You should also invest in a good tripod to pair up with this. Quite heavy so a tripod is required. But once you start looking at deep sky objects it will be endless fun. More practical to use than "cheap" telescopes since it will give you a wider FOV plus it's easy to pack.
3,Very good binoculars.Very heavy so get a tripod.They are big so not for children.For me the biggest disappointment is the chromatic aberration which is clearly visible at night around bright stars and the moon I don't know if it is a defect in my one or it is a standard problem. That's the only reason I've given 3 stars is you don't mind chromatic aberration these binoculars are for you.
5,I purchased the Celestron SkyMaster Giant 15x70 Binoculars at 2008 and by this time (2015) they stand almost as the first day although I've been using them very often at the countryside for sky watching. Some professional astronomer advised to me to get this binoculars instead of any amateur telescope great advise by the way it's really amazing to explore and discover the night sky with these just put on your tripod (heavy enough to hold them for a long time) and keep asleep all night long.
5,For the price these binoculars are very good. I can easily and clearly see the moon
5,Using them in the field and seems to be a strong pair of binoculars. Still feels like new.
5,Absolutely love these binoculars! We homeschool and bough them to go with an astronomy course.  THey work great.  Definitely recommend a tripod for extended use because hands generally shake.  They also work great for baseball games!  You can see great at games and can see great detail on the moon.  Good and sturdy.  Came with cases and such in order to transport.  We are very happy!
5,Its powerful light weight and cheap. Any more power and it would need a mount. I get by by bracing my elbow on something or resting them on something
5,If you love sky watching these are for you. I have used them in two areas city light and country light. In city when stars are not so easy to see you still get great vision and clarity. In country viewing the optics are nothing short of spectacular. They do have a little weight so a tripod or monopoly may be needed for long term use.
5,I was considering the 20x80's but decided on these 15x70's. These are hand holdable and provide a nice crisp image with plenty of light gathering. so far I have only used these on terrestrial objects around the back yard. I did compare them to my 12x50's and these and the 15x70's blow them away. they are big but not entirely too heavy. holding them out towards the end of the objective seems to be the best spot for balance and comfort. only downfall so far is the close focus distance is about 30 ft.
3,This is a true honest review which you won't find at the manufacturer's' site as they don't post even constructive criticism.So here goes:Pro: Great for earth views especially for the price. I saw some amazing long distance bird views with these.Con: Totally useless plastic tripod adapter wobbles all over the place making the binos ineffective for astronomy until you buy a new metal adapter for minimum $25. Also these binos like many others suffer from chromatic aberration (a red halo around objects) when viewing bright planets.Verdict -- great for earth (with new adapter) virtually useless for astronomy if planets are primary interest. With new adapter however you will get awesome moon and star views.
5,Highly recommended. The product arrived very fast and in perfect condition.
4,This is a great binocular for the price you're paying. Vision is clear focus is perfect and the binoculars look pretty solid.For this price I can't complaint about a  small stain on the inner side of one of the optics which doesn't affect vision at all or about the awful tripod adapter which is unstable as one made from chewing gum.Overall an excellent product for amateurs not willing to spend a lot of money.
5,I paid a little more than the current $54.99 by purchasing a day earlier but even at that - c'mon how can you beef 15x70 glass that works at that price??  The case is not so much and the lens caps exist.  I put these on a Gitzo monopod with the included (!!) tripod adapter and the view is CLEAR and sharp.  Collimation is good.  I can use these for hours without eyestrain.  I wouldn't toss these around but with care they should make you smile every time you use them.
5,These binoculars are great big wonderful things. I don't mind lugging them with me up the mountains to get the great views. I also don't really need to climb up the mountains anymore since I can see the top from way down here. The moon looks fantastic awooooo. I have found that they can be steadied without a tripod by gripping them at the farthest end of the lens tubes or by sitting down and resting my hands on my knees. Works good with glasses and without. Totally changed my perspective of the visible world around me. Thanks Chinese!
3,These are certainly good for long range viewing. The tripod mount works well. Definitely not great for walking around... these binocs are gigantic. My problem was that the barrels were not aligned put pf the box so that produced double vision...boo! I was able to slightly bend them back into alignment while viewing but next time I look through them a day later they're out of alignment again. It's pretty annoying and very disappointing.  Not confident in Celestron's quality control...but that's what you get for the price. You seem to get what you pay for.
5,My 15 y/o is very interested in the sky so the purchase was for her but these Binoculars impressed me because there are lighted areas in the sky and until we looked at them thru the binoculars it looked just like light.After looking we saw the tiniest stars that made up the light.You can even see the craters on the moon!I am VERY impressed!
5,I just received the binoculars. I had to play around with them for a while to get things into focus.  I just followed the instructions included and eventually got them right.  I have never used them before and was amazed at the sharpness of the moon!!! I could see the craters and geographic details and the rugged outline of the moon in the sky.  I also watched the birds and squirrels from quite a distance.  This was all during the daylight hours.  Can't wait for the sun to go down.  Very happy with this purchase..
5,These are an amazing value.  I had high hopes but these exceeded them.  The optics are clear and bright(this is based on their price point yes there are better but not at this price point) and far outperform the price.  They are large and a little heavy for small or elderly.  Also you need fairly steady hands or a tripod(mount included yay!).  You can also lay down on your back and use them that way which helps steady them.  I am now hooked and looking for my next fix.  20x80 here I come!
5,Bought the Celestron SkyMaster 15x70 with free shipping off Amazon on Monday and it arrived in prefect working order 1 day later on Tuesday.  No culmination needed unlike the new in box Tasco pair of binoculars that were unculminated right image was out of aliment from left side image and Tasco would not fix it under its warranty.Amazon had the best deal out there for this excellent pair of binoculars.  Large apertures the 70mm glass ends allows more light capture for your day and night time viewing pleasures.  I highly recommend this Celestron product.
4,I purchased this for my husband for a small birthday gift. He says they are constructed very well you can see the craters on the moon with them and the optics are very good. Please note the tripod adaptor that comes with it is very flimsy you may want to purchase your own. However all they are a very nice pair of binoculars for the money!
4,Great celestial binoculars.  Phil Plait author of the blog Bad Astronomy recommended them in one of his posts.  As indicated in many other reviews these are much too heavy to use without support or a tripod.  I would have given five stars if the included tripod adapter were the metal version instead of the cheap plastic one.
4,Great. Was really impressed
5,My husband and I are amateur star gazers and these binoculars come in handy for beginners. They're a little heavy for me being a small woman but my husband doesn't seem to have a problem. Ideally we'd like to get a tripod for the binoculars or something but for now they work great. We even used them for the lunar ellipse and it was AMAZING! These are great binoculars.
5,Saw these at the state parks whale watch station and ordered my own. I'm not a stargazer but use for wildlife viewing. Nice and clear at least for my elder eyes. The included tripod attachment works fine and is necessary. These are so powerful that there must be some support for using for even a few minutes. Doesn't have to be a tripod but something to steady the binoculars is necessary. They feel solid.
4,Excellent product. The only problem is the adapter which comes with it. It is plastic and does not strongly hold the binos. However I use it and still it can do the job (I bought a tripod for the binos.) To those who are having problems regarding the eyepiece cover (the long one) be sure to fold the rubber eyecups first before covering them. That way the cover won't slip easily.
4,We bought these to mount on a tripod to watch boats going up and down the river.  They work pretty well and seem to be a good value for what we paid.  I have nothing to compare them to but suspect more expensive binoculars might feature a crisper clearer image.  Still no complaints for the price we paid.
5,Great bino's.  I especially like them at the ocean.  I can see fishing boats way out that aren't visible to the naked eye.  I was watching seals offshore on a reef just like I was next to them.  Haven't used them much for stargazing but I did look at the craters on the moon.  I would recommend a good tri pod as the bino's are bit heavy and difficult to hold steady in the wind.  Awesome purchase for the money and the more I use them the more fun I'm having.
5,We all wanted to be the one to use these on our camping trip through Yosemite! At night we placed it on the Polaroid 72" Photo / Video ProPod Tripod to view the sky. The tripod handled its weight with ease. During the day we kept them handy for sightseeing. The magnification allowed us to view wildlife from great distances. The only catch is that the binoculars are quite heavy and the magnification so great that you need to rest them (or your elbows) on something to avoid the movement and compromise your viewing.
5,Was reluctant to purchase based on some of the negative reviews...but glad I purchased anyway.  Took them to the beach today and was able to watch dolphins and a pod of whales that I never would have been able to see with my old binos.  Whales must have been close to a mile out and was able to pick up the spout while watching a pod of dolphins thanks to wide field of view.  The downside was that we only had the one pair and had to share with the family...will be buying another pair today.
5,These binoculars were shipped quickly and arrived in perfect shape. They are wonderful for viewing moon craters distant planets and constellations. I don't find them to be unreasonably heavy either. I have small hands and so I do find that I hold my hands a bit farther from the eyepiece than my old ones. I also sometimes use my camera tripod but I prefer laying back in a lounge chair and viewing that way. It's a lot easier on the neck. I would recommend these binoculars to anyone who loves skywatching! They are also great for long distance nature watching!
5,Arrived on or before time  amazzing ! they seem to be great value I've checked them out and there pretty cool  I am glad I purchased 2 of them I also purchased the CAIDU binoculars there all right but if you like and coul use the extra size these seem to be a better value and are way more powerful  . Headed to Yellowstone to try them out .
5,I purchased it for my son and he loves it. He is studying the stars. When you look thru them you can see so clearly
4,These are great binoculars especially for the money.  What is NOT great is the cheap plastic tripod adapter.  Any touching and binoculars just wiggle around when you look through them.  Fortunately you can purchase a metal tripod adapter for about $10.  Works WAY better.
4,I do like these.  I really thought the power would allow to see the moon craters and follow the space station but it is very hard to hold steady.
4,Pros: Lens are clear and because of the size there is little eye fatigue.Con: Very heavy and large binoculars too heavy to pack for a hunting trip or hiking. Do not buy if you want to use for elk hunting or scouting.
4,wish it were more powerful
5,I upgraded from a pair of Bushnell Instavision 7x35 WA  with 490 ft. at 1000 yds. I must say that the Giant is just great. They were good to go right out of the box. All I had to do was focus. You can really see airplanes up close. The craters on the moon look great. I also check out the stars. At night I just just pick a random spot in the sky where I see nothing with my eyes and with the Giant so many stars. Very cool. Great price!
5,No 1 Fedex Sucks as they dropped this order of mine outside my front door without ANY INFORMATION..!!Any way these binos are just great . I live in a University campus and bought these to check out the chicks :). Jokes aside these are very easy to use very clear sharp image even for objects at like 2 miles away. The craters of moon are very clearly visible and so are the stars. I have turned avid fan of these binoculars.In short way more worth than any penny you spend on these binos.
4,We had originally purchased a telescope for our young daughters ages 7 and 11 to stargaze with.  It was too cumbersome complicated time-consuming and in the end we could still not see very well.  After ordering the giant binoculars we couldn't be happier.  Easy to use "point and shoot"...it's so much easier for beginning astronomers to use.  And now we can take them camping as well.
4,Before ordering make sure you need the light gathering ability of a 70 mm lens which adds much weight and the 15 x magnification which makes it difficult to steady while hand holding.  Construction is good and the resolution is decent but not as good as a number of higher priced binoculars.  I bought this pair as an Amason special and an quite happy with my purchase.
4,Impressive quality and viewing for such a rock bottom price.  These are no Zeiss optics but for the price these are amazing.
4,I haven't bought binoculars for quite a while so I guess I wasn't really how big these are.  We wanted them for auditorium events and traveling.  They are pretty heavy but I guess that is because they are powerful. We like them just didn't know how heavy they would be. They are good for star-gazing also. Haven't tried it for that but the instructions say this.
4,Very good bargain especially for the price!  Three minor detractions: Tripod mount could be a little stronger; Optics could be a little flatter to the perimeter and eyepiece arms could be a little stronger. Of course if this were done the price would go up. I would have given these a 4 1/2 but could not select fractions.
5,I love these binoculars! I used them for birding and stargazing. I use them daily to watch birds in my backyard. Easy to use and can see far away very clearly! Much easier to focus than a telescope! I would recommend a tripod for extended viewing times since they are heavy after a while. Also not a pair I would take on a hike due to weight. I have a smaller pair I use when walking long distances. Highly recommend!
3,Like many other people have reported I needed to try my own hand at collimating these binoculars as they arrived uncollimated. It was a fairly interesting experience learning how to collimate but I can't in good conscience award any stars for that :). There is also a fair bit of chromatic aberration again as other reviewers have mentioned.That said I've found these binoculars OK for the price. It's certainly whet my appetite for a higher quality pair of binoculars one day.
4,for 50 bucks these are great binoculars. To be perfectly honest the only celestial object i can make out in detail is the moon with this pair. It may be because i've only used them near my home where there are so many lights shinning from every direction. During daylight hours i'm able to focus objects very clearly.
5,Product met my every expectation for the price point and I did not experience any of the quality issues previously mentioned by other reviewers. Product worked perfectly straight out of the box. The size and weight takes getting used to and a tripod fixes the stability issue when viewing the moon or wildlife. Planets are much harder to view but then again it's binoculars we talking about. Would definitely recommend this product for the novice user - the price for entry to higher power binoculars is a win/win situation.
5,I bought these binoculars on a lark and it was a very pleasant surprise. They seem to be well made and they focus well.The weight is heavy enough that a tripod is needed so I also bought aÂ   Polaroid 72" Photo / Video ProPod Tripod Includes Deluxe Tripod Carrying Case + Additional Quick Release Plate For Digital Cameras & Camcorders         so that I could leave the binoculars permanently attached.Looking at the stars or just at the neighborhood has proven entertaining. I'm anxious for spring when I can do some bird watching.
5,Great binoculars! Great price.  We use them for viewing the ocean.  Whales boats etc.  focuses sharp and clear.  Easy to do both. Comes with tripod adapter and works as its suppose to didn't have to buy separately.  We can use these with or without our glasses.  Definitely would recommend purchasing.  We are just normal everyday people that wanted these to be able to view things sharp and clear to almost 9 miles away (that's how far the island of Molokai is from us).  Great purchase for the money.
4,These are great binoculars.  They're great to use for looking at the moon.  You can see 4 of Jupiter's moons.  You will not be able to see Saturn's rings though.  It was quite the let down and why I don't give 5 stars for this product.
4,Loved these Binoculars best i'v ever used and great price.  I was sad tho after 6months of use the focus ring stopped working so now I have to manually force it in and out to focus.  I was out of my return period and did not have option to contact seller.
5,This was a Christmas gift for my son who loves looking at the stars and constellations but doesn't always want to drag out one of his telescopes.  So far these are by far easier to move around than either telescope and the view is comparable.We particularly like the fact that the right side can be focused individually as I have trouble viewing through binoculars that don't focus independently. I'm thinking of buying a less powerful version for myself for general viewing but will definitely look at Celestron before other brands.
3,BInoculars do a great job bringing in stars you can't even see are there with your naked eye.  Problem is they are very heavy.....VERY heavy and I can't hold them steady enough to focus on anything.  Bought a tripod and that helps but then you are stuck looking at only one little spot at a time before moving and refocusing.  Had hoped to see the ISS better when it flies over but no way with the weight of having to hold them by hand to track a moving object.  Oh well.
5,Beautiful views of the Moon and perfect for Pleiades Heiades and birds but you can see Orion Nebula Andromeda Galaxy core...I gave this one for my mom for xmas and she loved it because while I take 20min to set up my go to telescope she is already lounging in a beach chair and asking about tea and sandwiches.But is havy maybe you have to change the strap for a more confortable one and I recomend a good trypod. Don't buy the the 14 bucs one is to instable.
5,I love these binocs.  They are heavy so I have to put them on a tripod.  My dogs had an insane moment and knocked them over and damaged them. I stuck the pieces back together and they work.  I also like to use them at night.
5,Amazing binoculars ! I am an astronomy newby but they are amazing so far !The only downside is how hard it is the get them to be steady ! Even with the BARSKA tripod mount they are still shaking a little bit when I put my eyes in the eyepieces.
5,Amazing product especially for the price! Highly recommend.
1,I have had 2 pairs of Celestron binos. I still use a 7x50 pair. My 10x50 worked fine until I dropped them and they gave me a double image. These 15x70 gave me a double image right out of the box. It was an offset view in the right view from the left view. A lot of complaints about this. I returned them. I didn't want to try to collimate them and lose the warrantee. I'll buy a better line.
4,they seem pretty good they came out of collimation but that took about a second to fix cant wait to use em at night.
5,They are on the large size for viewing distance  they are what I expected and perfect .Most would do better with 1 or 2 sizes down .
4,Well worth the money. Must have gotten a good set with no culmination problems. I can handhold them but much better with a tripod. Also they're quite bright and perfect for looking at the moon which is primarily what I bought them for.
5,Excellent for the price. They may be a bit heavy for some but they work nicely with any decent tripod stand. My real concern was how bouncy the view would be while trying to pick out and gaze at celestial bodies when handheld. Surprisingly the magnification is just right for me to keep it nice and steady while handheld. The provided view is excellent. The focus was easily adjustable to my wonky 20/90 vision.
4,These are very nice binoculars for the price- bright and well made. The only downside is that they do not focus very closely. I can't use them to watch birds in my feeders because the closest they focus is (guessing) probably 50-60 feet. That's not a flaw of the binocular just how it is designed. Beyond that range they are terrific good for star gazing as well.
5,These things are huge.  It's like a cartoon version of binoculars... really brings the birds in close.  Maybe TOO close for bird watching?  For stargazing they are OK but won't replace a telescope anytime soon.  If you just want to look at the moon or all the stars in a constellations at the same time these are great.  The tripod mount is a little flimsy get a different one if you are concerned.
4,I'm very pleased with this purchase. I bought them for star gazing. I just received them and have yet to use them for that. I did check them out though and they are awesome..
5,You won't find a better deal. Great quality(was expecting less for the price). Comes with tripod adaptercasedust clothlens coverscheap as hell strap and instructions.Rubberized outer shell for water proof.You don't need a tripod for these dont be misled. You can easily hold these just like any other smaller pair and steady themwhen you get used to them you can even hold them with one hand because they are lightweight for their size. Very good 3D images I am very pleased with these and very happy I did not spend alot of $ for them.
4,Purchase two of these for work. Had the supervisor try one out first. He likes it for working out of the airport tower. I myself have  a set of binocular that I really enjoy. It has a zoom lever. Just wish these had that set up. No matter how I look or type on Amazon. I could not find anything like mine.
5,Amazing to see the stars close up.  But after a night of using it I found I liked the Bushnell 12x50 better.  I could handhold the Bushnell and it gives a broader view of the sky.  These are very high quality for the price.  I picked up a used Bogen tripod with pan head at a thrift shop to use with the Celestron and it did the job holding them steady.  The tripod adapter with the Celestron is plastic but does the job well enough.
4,The lens caps are kind of flimsy and feel like they're cheaply made. The rubber material used as the outer shell for the binoculars sort of makes them feel like toy binoculars as well.Nonetheless they work GREAT! The magnification is mind blowing and the focus is very crisp. In terms of usability this is exactly what I wanted. For a good price too.
4,Same story as many others I had to return the first pair due to poor alignment which was causing double images.  The replacement pair arrived quickly and there is a night and day difference  the images are now very clear and sharp  great magnification.  Very satisfied with this purchase.
4,These collect much more light than my more compact binoculars but 15X is hard for me or my wife to hold stable enough for hand-held viewing. I probably should have purchased 12X with the same large 70mm inlet diameter. Still they work well and are easy to use with a bright image. They are very light-weight which was a pleasant surprise for me.
5,Excelente producto . 100% satisfecho
4,I bought these and a tripod to hold it still. I liked the one time I used them. Unfortunately they were burned up in the Ventura fire.
3,was hoping I would be able to snatch a glimpse of the aliens which visit my neighbor at night so I could prove to Joe Heck that extraterrestrials are real danger to Trump's american and the development of a global defense network should be priority one on his platform. Just think killer satellites in space protecting the freedoms of all god fearing terrestrial Christians which can be turned on fiendish communists and welfare dependents alike.
5,Purchased for last father's day still tells me to this day how much these are the best pair he's owned. Though would be even better if you could zoom in as it is fixed but going off of my dad's view definitely a good buy. Crystal clear picture and all around nice quality. The bag that's included is a nice add on as well.
1,You know the old saying; "If it seems too good to be true..."?  Well I should have known better.  I was fooled by the Celestron name.  After all they're Celestron... how bad could they be?  I should have read past the five star reviews. I don't care if you get these for free they are useless.  They are not even close to being collimated so everything is double vision. They will not focus and the optics are poor with all kinds of aberrations.  The tripod mount is a joke.  It's a flimsy piece of plastic that flexes and twists like it's made of rubber so it is virtually impossible to use these with a tripod.  I also tried a mono-pod.  Not much better.  They say "you get what you pay for." Not true.  I paid for working binoculars.  If these were free I wouldn't keep them because they totally ruin the viewing experience.  They pretty-much just suck even for this low price. Shame on Celestron for putting their name on a product with such poor quality. Do yourself a favor and just spend the money for some good optics.  It isn't worth the disappointment you'll feel when these "bargain" binocs show up.
3,These are decent binoculars but with astronomy binoculars I expected to be able to see planets more clearly and you really cannot.  About the only thing you can see are the moons around Jupiter.  If I had researched more thoroughly I would have bought a telescope.  The quality and picture is pretty good but just understand what you are buying if you are buying them for astronomy.
5,These are very nice if you use for more than a few minutes you might want to put them on a stand.
5,You will certainly get plenty of viewing 'bang for the buck' with these rest assured. Powerful enough for stargazing as well as any land-based viewing both near and far that you wish to undertake. I do recommend though that you purchase an adequate neck/shoulder strap as you may find the Skymasters' weight somewhat uncomfortable after awhile; Note: I obtained the OP/TECH USA Fashion Strap for this purpose (also thru Amazon) which fit perfectly and in tandem with the binoculars is working out very nicely indeed!
5,This is my first serious binocular purchase. I am completely happy. For viewing both day or night. I was able to see the peaks of the White mountains from a top a local mountain. The Whites are 120 miles away. Just what I wanted the Celestron for. Night viewing of the moon is also great too. I am able to steady them well enough their size or weight is not objectionable. Have not used them on a tripod yet. If you want to have something with mobility and power these are great.
5,What a great pair of binoculars it's actually my first binoculars i have bought after years of only owning telescopes but they work amazing! They do get a little heavy a few minutes of holding then upright but i have a Tripod which helped a lot so word of advice if you buy these binocular you should definitely buy a tripod
5,It's everything I could have hoped for. For the casual sky gazer these really fill the bill. Worked great straight out of the box. I was amazed at how many stars and other parts of the  sky I was missing with  the naked eye. These opened up a totally new view of our  universe. Very pleased. And yes I would highly recommend a god heavy tripod for use with these. They do get  heavy after a short  while. And order another metal adapter as well.
5,very bright and clear. A great purchase for the money. At first the size of the binoculars might be a little cumbersome I have a 10X25 which is smaller in size and I have to rest my arms on something to reduce vibration. I find the 70 mm. lens creates a steady hand hold. I also like the option of being able to use the Celestron with or without glasses. The folding rubber eye cups are terrific.
5,I tried many other pairs of 15X70 binoculars and all were out of collimation. I finally tried the low cost Celsestrons figuring these would be the ones I learn how to adjust the collimation after removing the rubber covers to get to the screws to move the prisms.  I guess that learning will have to wait these were spot on right out of the box.
3,VERY HEAVY WEIGHT AND HARD TO FOCUS IN GOING TO LOOK AROUND FOR SOMETHING TO STUDY THE NIGHT SKY PERHAPS WITH  A HIGHER MAGNITIZER AND DEFINETLY BUY A TRIPOD OR SOMETHING.....WE JUST HAD THE LUNAR MOON TOTAL ECLIPSE ON 9/27 INTO 9/28....AND ONCE YOU WERE FOCUSED ON THE MOON IT WAS VERY HARD TO HOLD IN PLACE BECAUSE THEY ARE SO HEAVY THEN WHEN YOU RELAX AND GIVE YOUR ARMS A BREAK ITS HARD TO FOCUS IN AGAIN....I THINK I WILL BE RETURNING
3,Clunky and large. I have smaller binoculars but sometimes the birds are too far away to see. These definitely alway for seeing birds further away but they are so big you can't really hold them steady so you need a tripod which is precisely what I was hoping to avoid when I bought them. Oh well.
5,For the price these are a great set of binoculars though as reviews and recommendations state you do need a tripod--they are heavy.  And not only is it easy to quickly fatigue holding them it's hard to hold them steady for long.  But with a tripod they're awesome.  My husband and I have been able to see wildlife stars and planets with them and have greatly enjoyed using them.  I recommend these to anyone who wants an affordable but sturdy and quality set of binoculars!
4,Binoculars are great...tripod adapter not so great :( too much vibration when trying to use tripod because tripod adapter not stiff or heavy duty enough.
5,Es un producto excelente. De muy alta calidad. Ofrece imÃ¡genes nÃ­tidas y brillantes. Para observaciones astronÃ³micas es muy bueno.
4,Great for an entry level binoculars. It serves its purpose well but I think there are other brands (which could be more expensive) with better quality binoculars. You have to use a tripod because it's too heavy to hold by hands. We place it inside our house so we can see the views outside the windows.
4,Wow.  These are very cool for casual stargazing -- even my 15 year old has gotten interested because these are so easy to use and provide great detail.  One advisory.  Get a monopod because there is no way you can hold them steady enough without one.
5,A bit bigger than I expected and a bit heavy for little me but the detail is amazing. Used this on my Alaska trip and it was fantastic! Great for any type of animal viewing really. Spotted black and brown bears whales otters mountain goats and tons of birds. Was even able to pick out a pair of puffin birds resting on the water. Amazing! Delivery was super fast. Not sure what to do about the crappy string supporting this thing. Need to go shop for separate neck strap.
5,This is an excellent binocular for hand-held viewing of the moon and comets and of animals birds and other wildlife. It doesn't have enough magnification for viewing stars. It is not a night glass but works very well in twilight and of course full sun. I keep it mounted on tripod and focused on the bird feeder. The birds appear to be right in the room but without the mess. It's good to carry in a car or boat but is a bit heavy for bird hikes.
5,These work real well for star gazing. Big lense brings in lots of light when viewing the nigh sky. a very crisp and clear image. They have some weigh as they are pretty big but not as heavy as I thought they would be.Even when looking at a super moon the image moves around alot as its hard to hold an image that far away steady in the lens. Fortunately it comes with a tripod mount to hold them steady.
5,I got my binoculars today and tried them when the moon came up.  they are amazing . I am new to stargazing and the detail you can see on the moon is awesome  I can't hold them still enough to see some other stars etc but its worth investing the money for a tripod.  Much better than a telescope and work great for daytime use and bird watching.  I can see two blocks away as if it was two houses down.  well worth the money
5,Great product at a good price.its January 5 and weâve only had them since Christmas but...good price good product no complaints.
4,The quality of the optics was pretty good for the price.  My only concern is the strength of the body.  Although they are much larger and heavier than a more typical size the strength of the tubes was not increased that much so you need to be very careful with these things because they could go out of alignment.
2,The eyepiece lens slides completely out of the focusing drum (focus adjusting screw no longer works). Used about 20 times. Disappointing glass optics. The 15x isn't for seeing too far so I was hoping for better optics than a higher powered binocular in the Celestron line. If you're just scanning the horizon looking for say a deer to kill this works OK. If you actually want a nice view of an animal sailboat whatever then this isn't for you. Given the poor construction or quality control I would look for something that has a longer life span and better optics. You get what you pay for and sometimes you get less than you pay for. The case here.
4,Bought these for my dad and he just loves them awesome Bino's at an outstanding price. Did how ever take some time to get in the mail but well worth the wait.
5,Many new amateur astronomers are anxious to buy their first telescope prior to learning the skies.  These Celestron binoculars are a great medium for that task and an incredible value.  Beware however they are quite heavy and for any kind of sustained use require a tripod for effective utilization.  They come with a soft carrying case and a tripod attachment device.  If you do not have a tripod or don't want to use one I would highly recommend a smaller pair of binoculars.
4,This is my first pair of "real" binoculars. After reading several reviews on how collimating the binoculars is easy and that focusing in the lenses would be the same I was sold. They're heavy so it's made of high quality material and comes with lens covers and a storage/carrying bag.
3,this is not a high quality item as it seems to bei bought it to look at starsand it is not good at that at allnothing is sharp focusthere may be a way to make it better as some say they havei will try thoes ideas laterall in all at full price it was a big bust\but at the sale priceyes i can look at birds somebut i can not see the holes in a target at 100 yds as i hopedno i do not recomend buying thisand i would not again
5,I am a crane operator and periodically like to inspect pins and safetys that are "up in the air".I was looking for some relatively cheap but high magnifying binoculars and came across these.Was a little hesitant due to the size (they are big and a little heavy) as I was not intending to use these for Astronomy.However once they arrived how could i not?They are fun to use at night.The clarity in these binoculars was extremely satisfying day and night.Would definitely buy again.
5,These specs are great for the price! Kind of hard to hold them steady though -- I recommend getting a good tripod. You'll probably want a lens cleaner as well. These are some of the best binoculars when it comes to stargazing -- the light-gathering power is incredible. The Andromeda Galaxy (M31) Pleiades star cluster Praesepe (Beehive) star cluster and the Orion Nebula are some good night sky targets. These binoculars are also good for viewing jets!
5,I read many reviews on this skymaster 15x70 binocular some good and some bad. I am very happy with mine except for the tripod adapter that came with it.(Its not stiff enoughand the binocular rocks side to side while focusing) They are a heavier than I exspectedso my camera tripod was not steady enough so I had to order a heavy duty tripod I will write a review on it also.
4,These were not really usable for star gazing.. could not hold them steady enough.
4,I bought these for my wife for Christmas.  She seems to like them but because they are so powerful you really have to have a steady hand or tripod mount.
5,Best binoculars I have ever used no need for a tripod unless you need extended viewing times for stars etc.  I would say for star gazing and the price these are perfect.  The weight allows you to use very lightweight tripods so that is a plus as well.  Daytime use is amazing as well very powerful.
5,These are excellent quality binoculars and a darn good price too! They were recommended to me by my astronomy professor so they gotta be good haha! Tho they are technically stargazing binocs they can be used for sporting events bird watching or various other daytime events. I will say tho a pair this size can be very difficult to wield so you may need a tripod or at least something to prop them against if you plan to look at objects far off.
4,It is easier to see the heavenly bodies with two eye pieces.  My 10 year old grandson looked through it to see the moon and declared "I can see the American Flag"!!  Of course he was kidding but we will enjoy it a lot when the weather turns nice and be able to see some amazing sites.
5,I bought these binoculars specifically to view Comet Panstarrs which was so faint that we couldn't see anything with the naked eye. They did the job beautifully! The comet's head and long tail were readily visible through the binoculars. The binoculars are easy to focus even for people like me who wear eyeglasses and they are not so heavy that you absolutely have to mount them on a tripod. I highly recommend the Celestron SkyMaster 15 x 70 binoculars! And the price is very reasonable at $57.
5,Great binoculars for the price!  I have owned other large "price point" binoculars from other manufacturers but they all were poor quality fit finish and performance.  I expected these Celestron's would be the same but decided to give them a try because of Amazon's great return policy.  I was pleasantly surprised as these Celestron 15x70 are not only quality made they perform like binoculars costing hundreds more.  They definitely won't be going back!
5,I loved them! A little heavy but I really love the view.
5,I had to return the first pair of binoculars I received because of collimation issues.  However the second pair is great!  I can see much more with these than with my 10 x 50 binoculars.  I am not a serious stargazer but have enjoyed many a starry night seeing all that these binoculars reveal to me!
4,They are a tad heavy and thus tend to wobble especially when doing astronomical observing.  However they are quite easy to mount on a tripod which overcomes this.  The optics are very good and the focusing is very good but very sensitive as one would expect with this high a magnification.  The wide field of view makes for especially good nature observing.
4,These binoculars are awesome. The only thing is the tripod is too small and weak to support these binoculars. Plus you cannot use them without a tripod really. So I had to return them.But apart from that these are a great buy!
5,First of all the price is what attracted me.  Was looking for a powerful pair of Binoculars that didn't cost a fortune.  Celestron is a name I know and these were the far reaching view I was looking for.  Well constructed large lens not to bulky but will tire you out for holding them for any length of time.  The Tripod adapter is a great idea to setup for those in between times.  They are comfortable affordable and a great value.
5,I purchased these binoculars a little over a year ago and they are still going strong! The 70mm aperature draws in a good deal of starlight and alot of faint "Messier" and "NGC" objects can be observed realitively easy. I absolutely enjoy the "wider angle" these binos have and the Milky Way is something you will enjoy seeing. The included tripod mount is a little flimsy but these Celestron binos are light enough in weight to handle without. I highly recomend these binoculars! Cant go wrong for the price.
3,Instructions were not very clear on the tripod mount and how it attaches to the binoculars.  I ended up taking apart the binoculars unnecessarily when trying to find the tripod mount connector.  I had to call tech support to learn that I wasn't suppose to disassemble a plastic cap which no longer stays in place but the correct cap was the one with the logo on it on the opposite side.  This could have been put into the owner's manual.  I also felt that the magnification fell short of what I expected...
4,Great pair of binoculars for the price. I was able to see Jupiter and 4 of its moons very easily even with light pollution. But these binoculars definitely need a tripod to keep them steady.
5,Love these binos for the price.  Really buy them if you want big light buckets.  All focal length caveats included.  Any handheld at this magnification is difficult to hold.  Just be steady and prepare for very good views.Best use is for seeking with a larger telescope.Excellent buy.
5,Nice Binoculars
4,Really great can highly recommend for watching the moon and stars even from the city. I gave it 4 stars because the bracket to mount to a tripod is worthless!!! Please make a note of it if you plan to use it with a tripod as I did.
5,As expected not too heavy
1,Got the binoculars today and set them up on my tripod so the kids could see the moon.  The tripod adapter will lock tight but is very easy to disengage.  That would be one thing but one slip and the whole tripod lost balance.  A three-foot fall to the ground is terrible enough -- I'd expect scuffs and possible loss of collimation -- but one ENTIRE OBJECTIVE LENS BODY popped CLEANLY off!In case you're not clear what I mean look at the image above and imagine that a whole cone has been removed.  Yep that's what happened.I think I got a total of ten seconds viewing from these.  I'm trying to glue them back together but not holding out a lot of hope for that the collimation will probably useless even assuming that there is enough structural strength to hold it together.  Then again it didn't have much structural strength to begin with.EDIT:  I added a washer to the tripod mount attachment and that seemed to solve the wobble problem. So if you get one of these definitely buy yourself a pack of 1/4" washers.
4,Wish I would have looked at the weight of them. Other than that..great binoculars and clear view at a very long distance.
3,I agree with the QC comment. First pair had debris and smudges on inside of optics so I returned them for a replacement second pair had debris. The debris on the second pair doesn't seem to cause any viewing problems ( caused glare and bright spots in the first pair). I decided that based on the price "LD" I could live with some dust because they work for looking at the night sky.
5,These are just light enough to be hand-held and they are magnificent for viewing the ships coming up and down the Detroit River from our riverfront apartment. They also show the craters on the moon. For the price they are really quite unbeatable I think.
5,Works great everything I expected.  Now I need to get my eyes corrected (I've been putting it off) so that I enjoy it's full capabilities.  All of the reviews were very helpful and appreciated.  I think that I hexed myself with this purchase: it's never cloudy in Kansas City at this time of year it's been cloudy many nights since the binoculars came in the mail.  I'm up late and up early any time that it clear having the time of my long life.
5,Hefty and rubber clad.  I use them to view far away mountains and the clarity is great.  As other reviewers recommend do yourself a favor and buy a stand if you plan on sustained viewing.  I'm a big guy and I figured I could hold these up for extended views. Now I'm going back to buy a tripod.
5,I read lots of reviews on these before making the jump.  What a great product that is well worth the risk of poor collimation. I have ordered multiple pairs and only had one that was out of collimation.  Amazon's return policy made that a simple fix.These do get heavy after a few minutes so make sure you have a tripod handy.  These were a great step between learning constellations and getting a larger telescope to start detailed observing.
1,Binocs came out of the box broken and missing parts. Focus yoke for left eyepiece broken and finishers missing. Does Amazon even inspect returns before shipping them out again? Returned item same day it arrived and subsequently ordered and received Orion 15x70 unit.  A little more expensive but a new product with better build quality.
5,The tripod adapter is TERRIBLE. It bounces like CRAZY. You'll need a MUCH better adapter if you're thinking about mounting to a tripod but the quality of these binoculars otherwise is incredible. Well worth the purchase.
5,Love it! First time I use binoculars that won't give me double image/visual. I have tried several binoculars in the past and no matter how I adjust them I always see two of image in front of me. I thought maybe my eyes are not aligned but with this binoculars I am able to see the image as it is supposed to not like I am crossing my eyes.
5,These binoculars are really great. I thought they'd only be used with a tripod for looking at the stars. But after taking them on a road trip to Big Bend National park in Texas I think these are great for just about any use you can think of. They aren't that difficult to manage when handheld and the optics are really good and bright. I definitely recommend these. They are large to carry but then its the size that makes them work so well.
5,Although a little heavy they worth every pennyJust forget using them only with your bare hands spend some bucks and purchase a tripod
5,Excellent Binoculars for amateurs like me. I bought this mainly for sky glazing but I took with me for our yellowstone trip. It did really help me spot a Grizzly which otherwise I would have ignored. Its not that heavy my 10 years old and his cousin were able to hang it around the neck and use it.
5,I had purchased a pair of these for myself back in September and loved them enough to buy another pair as a gift for my father in-law.  I've used mine for sighting target practice star gazing and just peering across the lake I live on.  I do use a tripod when star gazing and have been able to see the moons of Jupiter (i think) which is pretty cool.  I doubt you can beat the price/quality ratio anywhere.
4,worth it-lasts long  time too-view and adjust each eye then match with center focus
3,They are acceptable for average user or beginner and regular general use but I barely used mine and after approximately a year the retaining screw to the eye piece adjustment cam came loose and went missing so now you cant operate them properly until screw is replaced. I would expect better quality control from Celestron and of course the warranty has run out.
5,These are a good deal considering the size of the objective lenses and the amount of light they gather.  They are easy to handle and are not as heavy as they look.  I used them to observe some large birds in flight and to observe some southern sky objects and was delighted in what I saw.  I did have to tweek the collimation when I got them but that was easily done and I look forward to using them more.
4,Only problem was the delivery.  Made a call and they sent it the next day. Probably got caught in the Xmas rush.  The binoculars were more than expected observed the Orion Nebula (M82) not bad for the Los Angeles area.  I have enjoyed the time I get to observe with them.
5,Just what I was looking for to get an up close and personal look at the moon and stars while I was at the beach.  I was surprised at how far out on the ocean I could see too.  Really enjoyed these while I was on vacation.
5,We are beginnig astronomy and these binoculars are a great start. We have been able to see star clusters galaxies and hundreds of stars where there are just a few to the naked eye. Also was able to see Jupiter and her 4 moons. The binos are a little heavy to hold and a tripod helps but it awkward to use (could also be due to being a beginner.) This is a great product to get to get started. I would also recommend a green laser pointer.
5,Darn good product. Good in low light. If you do not have steady hands get a tripod. I use it to spot fish getting out of the water on the large lake and it proved to be sharp and clear at the distance of two miles.
5,I purchased the Celestron Outland to carry in my backpack and was so pleased with them that I decided to get the SkyMaster's as well.  These things are very large and can be heavy with constant use.  However they do come with a tripod mount that helps.  They are very clear and I am extremely pleased with my purchase especially with the price I paid for these.
5,At first I had problems getting both images to coalesce into one binocular image.My second pair was the exact same.My brother noticed the same problem and neither of us liked them.Playing with them I found that the focal distance was shorter than the rubber eyepiece protectors.When I pressed my eyes into the cups the image was perfect!These binocs are well worth the money and work very well with clear and sharp optics.
5,For the money these things are awesome. Has a nice clear image with little or no distortion or blurring. Contrast is good can see good details.  there not as good as top end binoculars but there not $1500 ether. The rubberized coating is nice to get a good grip.only drawback as others have said is there heavy so after a few minutes of looking through them you start to sway around a bit.but it does come with a tripod adapter.
3,I really wanted to like these binoculars.  The value seemed excellent for the price.  However after opening mine had a problem with collimation.  In layman's terms this meant that they did not focus correctly.  It was as if I was seeing double.  I believe there are ways to collimating either by doing it oneself or sending them to celestron but I didnt want to hassle with these so back to Amazon they went.  An A+ to amazon as usual for the painless return.
5,Would not have expected such a great pair of binocs for this price. Would definitely recommend! Enjoyed watching the activity in and around the ocean from our condo. Mounting on a tripod REALLY helps due to the distance you can see.
4,Not as clear and sharp as I would have liked but for the price I'm willing to accept it.  I guess I got spoiled with my $300 Nikon binoculars.
5,These give a beautiful view of hidden marvels in the sky. I'd never seen the moons of Jupiter before! But you must find a way to support the binoculars since you won't be able to hold them completely still in your hands.  There are dedicated mounts made for binoculars but I rigged a heavy duty cymbal stand from a drum kit to hold them steady which allowed me to lean back and enjoy the view with no jitter at all.
5,I don't know much bout astronomy but wanted something fun to do and wanted to try out the whole star gazing biz. These binoculars were perfect for me! Its a lot handier than the telescope I also purchased. Excited to bring these things with me next time I go out on a hike too! Super handy and I'd recommend these to your average Joe just looking to dabble in astronomy.
4,Nice binocular rating 4stars only because tripod adaptor is not too good. Cannot lock down the binocular it wobbles sideways... Not sure it was designed to do so or. It is defective.At this size and magnification tripod is a must.
5,These guys are big.  I am very impressed by the quality.  I'm using them for stargazing and looking at the moons of Jupiter.  Wonderful tool.
5,Ezcellent optics solid construction tripod adapter included.  Hard to beat this combo.  Because of the size of these a tripod or monopod is essential for most viewing.  My only minor criticism is with the cover on the threads for mounting the tripod adapter - some ridges or knurling on the edge would have been nice
5,I was expecting these to take a week to get to me and they were here the next day.I can see very clearly through them. I can see the craters of the moon. They're a bit heavy but they are big so that's to be expected. I am definitely going to get a tripod though because you just can't stand still enough to get a good view of the stars w/o the image bouncing all over the place.
2,first things first: does not focus closer than about 40 feet! i can't even spy on my neighbors with that kind of performance.second: feel really flimsy. the rubber armor looks like the chinese batman who was in a hurry getting his suit on.thirdly: yes the tripod bracket is awful. breathe on the binoculars and they wiggle back and fourth for 60 seconds. i modified mine by pouring wax into the spaces of the molding then wrapping in a very healthy amount of gaffers tape. this actually worked ok.fourthly and most importantly: the optics are clearly no good. tons of coma and chromatic aberration.  venus looks like a rainbow snow cone. which on its own could be cool but I've already got stuff that does that.I bought these to check out Comet ISON so i guess they'll be perfect for that....
5,I was very impressed with these binoculars. Feel as if they were worth much more then what they cost. Used them for some star gazing and was amazed at how many more stars were visible with the light these gather. Could easily see Jupiter and four of its moons with the 15x magnification. Bought a monopod to use with the tripod holder included with binoculars. That really helps keep things steady. Can also be used reasonable well hand held for bird watching etc.
5,These were exactly what I ordered. We use them in the woods and on the lake. You have to be steady but the optics are very clear. We have some fawns in the back yard and you can count their spots..The night sky is very cool and is what these are designed for but still versatile.
3,it does not deserve 5 stars for sure. It is cheap and it is what you get. Yes the tripod adapter is crap but the trick with epoxy works well. The image is big but defintely not sharp. I can see more detail with quality 8x42 binocs with ED glass than these binocs. They also suffer from chromatic aberration a lot. But if you decided to but they give you lot of fun watching the stars. IMHO the best thing to do is to save some money work harder and buy Fuji instead.
5,I bought a Celestron telescope several months ago and have been happy with it so I wanted to give the binoculars a shot and am just as pleased with these as the telescope! I wanted them for a duel reasons; for simple prepper reasons but also for the gun range and have been so impressed with just using it on the gun range. Attached to my tripod easily and can see 150-200 yards clearly down range. Highly recommend!
5,Thanks Amazon for a trouble free transaction and delivery the Celestron binoculars are great  Celestron SkyMaster Giant 15x70 Binoculars with Tripod Adapter        Â I would suggest anyone buying them purchase a tripod however as they are a little heavy to hold still.
4,These seem nice very nice binoculars for the money.  Very good sharp views of the moon at 15X.  These are great for nature watching also.  I would recommend using a tripod for this bigger binocular.  After 1 or 2 minutes the arms get tired of holding these up.
4,I wish it was stronger but as is  it is OK it brook and I had it fixed
3,BEWARE!  Whatever is in the rubber that used to make the protection cup EATS WOOD finishes.  These binoculars ruined a very expensive wood top finish on a table and also on my wood floor.  DO NOT SET THEM ON ANYTHING WOOD. Its will eat the finish off.The binoculars are very heavy but they work well.  Thats why I gave them three stars.  Otherwise for the damage they caused I would give them minus three stars.
5,Great astronomy binoculars. Can see Jupiter's four moons Orion Nebula Pleiades the Beehive Cluster etc. Get a tripod that can be raised to 6 ft height for ease of viewing. Needs a sturdy tripod since it's heavy. I bought a tripod that was around $35 but the plastic mounting part cracked.
2,I have two other pairs of these binoculars.  The first pair (bought about 8 years ago) is excellent and provides a really clear sharp image.  The second pair (bought about 4 years ago has a good image in each eyepiece but when looking with both eyes even after adjustment the images don't line up very well.  The most recent pair (bought a month ago) has poor optics with the image on each side exhibiting a lot of refraction so that you get a bit of a rainbow effect on the edges of whatever you're looking at.I originally bought these as no other binoculars offered the kind of magnification & light capture for the price.  The first pair was truly a great value the last pair... not so much.
5,Love these binoculars. I have been watching the hawk mother and her babies all day (at about 50 yards away).  I like these so much that I'm ordering a second pair to have at my mountain house to star gaze and bird watch. Great binoculars for the price. But you definitely need a tripod (the adapter comes with the binoculars so don't order another one).
5,Exactly what we were looking for to pull in the stars at night.
2,I bought these thinking they would open up the night sky and allow me to see different planets in our solar system and some nearby galaxies and stars. But that is not the case they literally just make stars brighter. You can't even see see Mars surface it just looks like an orange star and a little bit brighter in the binoculars. But the moon did look incredible with theses. They are very hard to steady with out a tripod and even with a tripod they still are not what I was looking for. I am getting ready to return mine and get a telescope. Don't buy these if your wanting to do stargazing buy them if you want to look at things on the earth's surface you can see things miles away like your right next to it.
4,Very good bino's. I bought them for watching football games and they performed as I expected.Initiallyhad a little trouble focusing them.  Also came in handy for viewing the Super Moon although they werebest when mounted on a tripod thanks to the adapter that was supplied.
5,Same as others have said:  Great value for the price works great as you would expect not quite as clear (but not too far off) as a $200 pair and just a bit more shaky due to the increased zoom over a standard 8-10x set.  For bird watching lake gazing general ground viewing these are easily handheld and work just fine.  For star/night gazing it is probably a tripod affair.
4,I was extremely pleased to purchase these binoculars at the listed price of $90.00.  I am disappointed that one month later the price has been slashed in half!  My only complaint is that it is very difficult to align the eye pieces to keep one from being blacked out.
5,Great for my simple needs in exploring the dark skies or earthly terrain.  Price was perfect for starting out with this binocular.Yes a little heavy for your wrists if not used to the size.  Comes with a tripod adapter and that was a selling point.  Getting a tripod will easily compensate for long viewing sessions and make viewing easier and more enjoyable.  Looking forward to many outdoor day and nighttime viewings.
5,Perfect right out of the box. I wear glasses (near sighted) but I don't need them to use these. As to the flimsy tripod mount there is a simple fix. Another reviewer wrote that filling the cavity on either side of the mount with epoxy. I tried this and it works! After it hardens it greatly reduces the jiggling when the binoculars are mounted to a tripod. I also recommend  using a ball head tripod.
5,Took it to our place in Mexico and it was awesome.  Could see all my favorite surf spots from my back porch in a wide field instead of the narrow field realized with smaller binocs.  Whale watcheding was incredible also.  At night we looked up at what appeared to be only a few stars to the naked eye but wow! Through these things a blanket of stars could be viewed.  Definitely a great purchase.
4,They are perfect for medium/far objects. Happy with the price and the build quality is great. Comes with nice sense covers and the ability to attach a tripod makes them really functional. Packaging was just right too.
5,Collimation was off when they arrived but I found instructions to adjust on YouTube and now they work fine clear easy to focus a little heavy but large enough to let in a lot of light hard to hold steady due to 15x but that was expected.
5,Great pair of binoculars. The magnification is awesome. Not a cheap pair of binoculars. They are pretty heavy and a tripod would be a very good idea. I use them too look out my high-rise windows so I lean the binoculars against the window. This steadies them pretty well.For the price these cannot be beat. Have had no problems with them. I would definitely recommend.They come with a cheap case so you may want to invest in more solid protection for them.
4,I just got it and had a look at the moon.. amazing...anyways I noticed that mine were missing its "Zoom lever" ?!!  Does anyone else have the same problem? or Is this product just made this way and the picture shown in the manual is off...?
3,These are HUGE! If you are elderly (I am) If your wife has small hands (she does) If you wanted some binoculars to watch the birds at their feeder from your recliners (we do) than these are not for you. I accidentally ordered this item yesterday and in the typical Amazon fashion they arrived today. I tried to get a return mailing label to send these back and order a smaller set. Having difficulties not typical of Amazon. Will keep all informed. Steve
5,Pretty good binoculars for looking at the stars and planets at night. From my fairly light-polluted location I could see the moons of Jupiter but not Saturn's rings. If you are new to astronomy as a hobby and are thinking of buying a telescope I'd recommend starting with these first. One tip: use them with a tripod for a much much better experience.
5,So clear and comfortable to use.  Light weight yet sturdy.  My only problem was receiving the first pair of these.  I ordered 2nd day air and never received them but true to Amazon they sent out another pair overnight delivery so that I had something for my husband to open on Father's Day.  Amazon is a class act and that is why I continue to purchase almost everything through them!
3,As others have said these are Heavy even with a decent tripod there can be vibration that effects the optics.  For the use I have bird watching from home they will work fine.The bracket that was included in the box for mounting to a tripod is a useless POS. The knob to tighten it broke the first time I used it.
5,Besides having to bend your neck and they do get a bit tiresome after a while waaay easier to use than a telescope and can see almost everything an 8 inch dobsonian telescope can just with a little less clarity. Was really happy with the results being as cheap as they are. Worth every penny!!
4,First pair I got a friend told me the mirrors were out of alignment (I was seeing double stars) Amazon replaced and the second pair work fantastic. These were a gift for my 20 year old stepson and he really likes them.
5,Muy buen producto me encanta como se ve es necesario trÃ­pode para las estrellas
5,The binoculars were suprisingly lightweight for their size and power.The 70mm lens were great at light gathering and the 4.75 mm exit pupilprovide more light than most adults can use.  (The avg. is 3-4 mm)With a good strap is easy to wear for long periods and excellent for long distance terrestrial viewing or general astromical use.  You really need a tripod to use the full power effectively but for short periods those with steady hands can enjoy the binocs on the fly!
5,The value for the dollar on these binoculars is already well known. I also found this to be the case! I'm impressed by the power and clarity of this product for both terrestrial and astronomical observing. The weight certainly requires at least a monopod for stability and prolonged viewing. These were a "Today's Deals" special when I picked them up. I'm very happy I jumped on the deal!
5,I bought it as a Christmas gift for my husband and he loves it!
3,I THINK IF I HAD DONE MORE RESEARCH I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT SOMETHING STRONGER.  AND I WEAR GLASSES SO VISION IS NOT MY STORG POINT - SO I CAN'T REALLY BLAME IT ON THE BINOCULARS.  IN DEFENSE OF THE PRODUCT THEY DO HAVE A VERY SOFT EYE LENS PAD THAT FOLDS BACK TO ALLOW FOR MY GLASSES TO BE WORN WHILE USING THE BINOCULARS.  PRODUCT IS FINE IT'S MY EYES THAT ARE NOT SO GOOD CANT RETURN MY EYES THEY CAME WITH ME TO THIS PLANET.
5,The binocular is great for birdwatching looking at sceneries and neighbors.  For looking at the night sky it can be quite hard without a tripod as the binocular is heavy.
5,I can see alot
5,Excellent! Collimation is perfect! Purchased a Plano Protector Four Pistol Case to keep them secure. Extremely fast shipping and highly secure packaging. It was tough wading through all the "budget" binoculars in search of the right pair. If you're doing the same I highly recommend you try these.
5,Great pair of binoculars! I bought this pair after reading all of the reviews and I have not been disappointed. I use them for everything. Also I recommend that you use a tripod since they are heavy to hold. They come with a tripod attachment so you just need to purchase a tripod. You'll be amazed at what you can see with these.
5,Couldn't be happier!Not an expert on binoculars but for the quality I would of gladly paid twice as much.Purchased these exspecially for Eagle nest watching and they've surpassed our expectations.The clarity is amazing! We've tripled our amount of time in the field with these and look forward to years of enjoyment with these.
5,Have not received the product yet as I'm a prime member for many years with 2 day shipping ordered on 27th will not be here until 6/2 that's 6 days instead of 2??? since prime went up in price they have been very poor in customer service! Can not wait to try out these for now 5 stars as it has nothing to do with the product that amazon is slipping up.
1,I have had these for around a week and I have not been impressed. The fine tuning barely does anything to help with the focus. Also I have a big head and even when fully open the eye spacing is almost too short. Then today these fell over while sitting on my table and broke. Just fell over and snapped like a cheap toy. I have taken picture but apparently I'm an old fool because I can't seem to figure Amazons format for posting pics...After searching online I have come to the conclusion that Amazon is broken.. There is no link to post pictures and Amazon customer service is not receiving calls at this time. Apparently they think that COVID19 can be transmitted by phone? WTF Amazon?
4,This product represents quality and price. May not be the ultimate but come's close when comparing prices and products available. Construction is durable and lens quality is vary good. Quick to focus but may need to purchase more durable case. Case provided is OK if you are just storing at home not for travel.
5,I bought these because of the great reviews I have always enjoyed looking at the stars and was surprised what I could see with a crappy little set that I owned. I bought these and all I can say is wow. The viewing experience was amazing. They came perfectly aligned and collimated. Saw some beautiful sights with them fast shipping great product I will be climbing a mountain tonight and taking these with me tonight.
4,These were a gift for my mother-in-law and she *loves* them. They are a little cartoonishly big and I find it difficult to focus them because any tiny movement is so magnified. But my mother-in-law thinks they are the best binoculars ever so I rated it a four.
2,Beware these binoculars do not come collimated and you will need to have them adjusted. Its very difficult to collimate these yourself.  I tried and could not do it and could not find anyone that could. I ended up trashing them and buying a pair from an optical dealer that does collimate and test their binoculars before you walk out the door with them.
5,This is a must have product if you don't want to spend a fortune on a decent binocular that can also double up as a fairly ok telescope. I was amazed by the distances I could view in broad daylight and the visibility of craters on the moon. This telescope also was able to reveal a maze of stars that weren't visible to the naked eye. Must buy in my opinion!Jagan
5,First time use tonight - mounted on the tripod and saw Jupiter and 4 of it's moons!  And that was in town through a light layer of winter cloud cover.  Can't wait to get a good look at Andromeda and the Pleiades in dark skies.  Great price.  Great deal.  You will definitely need a tripod though they are a bit heavy.  Well worth what I paid.
5,Amazing binoculars I was able to see the full moon really clearly even though I live in the city. I am going to go somewhere in the country side and look at the stars. I used it at a cricket match and the players came right out in front. Amazing clarity because of huge light intake. Love it
5,Excellent binocs for the money.  My shakieness is an issue for viewing space objects but if your not old and shaky they will be fine.  I'm going to use some of the anti shaky methods some of the other reviewers wrote about.  But terrestrial objects can be seen fine.
4,These are very good binoculars.  I was able to view Jupiter and even see some of the moons the first night out.  It does require a tripod for astronomical viewing.
4,For the price these are great binoculars and are almost as sharp as my 10x30 IS Canon's! I can hand hold but something to lean against for support is a good thing. Being a retired photographer I am critical of the optics and these do a very decent job for the price.
3,I recently bought the Nikon 10x50 "action" binoculars and I LOVE them. Super clear crisp images. I read reviews saying that 10x50's were the best combination of magnification & light transmission & size. Did I listen to those reviews? No. I wanted more magnification. The Celestron 15x70 are good but the Nikon's are better/more clear & less "vibration" (because they are slightly lower magnification). These Bino's are OK but 1 pair of good 10x50's would have been sufficient for day & night (astronomy) use.
5,I ordered it last week  and when I tested it i found it realy very cheap comparing with its quality and ability  . i went to my farm and started watching my camels by this binocular from very long distance  around 500 meter  . clear vision and comfortable for my eyes. I used before many binoculars and i can compare it with the high quality binoculars but with more and more safe for the money
5,These things are pretty large but work great.  I think a tripod is necessary if you want to view anything really far away.  Comes with a mount for that right on the camera body.  Nice and clear and the focus works great.
5,This has been a great purchase for my backyard star gazing.  So cool to see nebulas and galaxies without the difficulty inherent with even the most basic static telescopes.  That said its been useless for my wife and young kids who find it difficult to zero in on messier objects.  They think the moon looks pretty cool though.
5,Works very well!  Great visually but you do need a tripod for stargazing as they are heavy.  However you need the size for stargazing. One thing to beware of the strap comes apart easily so don't trust it to hold well.  The eyepiece cap can be difficult to put back on since it is attached to the strap so you can't lose it easily.
5,Good for a beginner astronomer even better than some of the telescope I've used. The first time using them I can see anything from a tree about 20 feet away to seeing Jupiter and its 4 large moons. Yet to look at further celestial objects but good for the price.
5,These binoculars allowed me to clearly watch humpback whales breaching and playing off shore from our living room. They are light enough for prolonged use with a very easy adjustment to the focus as wildlife migrates.I've had smaller binoculars that were more tiresome on my hands than these.
5,These are a great pair of powerful binoculars. I would suggest getting a tripod to go along with them because the large magnification doesn't make for a steady image. The image is perfectly bright and sharp.Buy these for star gazing or bird watching. Don't take these to the ballgame as the shake will make them unusable.This is a case where you get more than what you pay for !
5,These are amazing. i use them during the day to spot planes and far off smoke stacks. At night i use them to see craters on the moon and view the amazing stars. I would deff buy these if i wanted to sky watch. I cant wait for the meteor showers .
4,What I dislike about it was that is to heavyweight
5,I absolutely love these binoculars!  I use them with a Manfrotto/Bogen tripod along with a hefty cast iron bracket.  (The tripod bracket that comes with these binoculars is useless as it bounces around for 12 seconds before stabilizing).My bincoulars came perfectly tunes.  Getting very nice crisp images without chromatic abberation issues.
5,These were a gift to my husband who has vision problems.  He enjoys fishing and watching nature.  These binoculars are perfect for him as he can adjust them to his vision needs.
5,Great brand high quality product perfect design but unfortunately not as expected !
3,So this are a bit heavy and a tripod would likely improve the overall viewing experience. I bought these for night sky viewing.  Looking at the moon is amazing but anything else - planets galaxies - can't see a thing - just a bigger bright spot in the sky.  I was really hoping to see more detail but not with this set.  I'm using them now for nature viewing and they are perfect for that.
5,A great product for this price.. I tried watching moon and jet planes - results were amazing! Only suggestion I had for Celestron is that the tripod adapter could have been closer to its center of gravity.  Because it has more weight in the front side when I use it on tripod its difficult to fasten on tripod using the adapter.
5,Bought these for my daughter for Christmas.  She loves them.
5,What a great pair of binoculars these are.  I can read a license plate 1/2 mile away.  They are substantial in size which is nice for holding up.  The price was awesome for this product.  And shipping was the best.  I received less than 48 hours after placing the order.  If you need a great "home" pair these are the ones I recommend.
5,I'm not a binoculars expert but I will say this does everything I had hoped for. I use it to look at the islands within a 25 mile radius of my home. I'm very pleased with the ease with which I use it. Note this does not come with a tripod. It comes with an adapter that hooks the binoculars into a tripod. A tripod must be purchased separately.
5,I'm no binocular enthusiast/critic and I haven't owned these long enough to speak to their longevity but I just have to say this is one rugged set of binoculars.  No little cheap plastic bits and pieces.  Also I have used a half a dozen or so higher end binoculars on the range and none had the clarity and field of view of this set.  Very impressed.
5,If your interested in sky watching and perhaps not quite sure about investing in an expensive Telescope....then These are fantastic!  I could actually see the moons around Jupiter!
5,If you want max binocular for the buck then this is it. They are big and super well made. Perfect focus. Yes a bit hard to hold for an extended period up at the stars without getting a little shaky but that's what the tripod adapter is for. Great for daytime use as well. Arrived promptly were well packaged and in perfect condition. Highly recommended.
4,Clear views and a great design/manufacture. A 5 star product in this price range but had to give 4 because of the flimsy tripod mount included. If you really want stable picture from a tripod take a suggestion and get a metal mount. Cheap plastic "extras" are just that... Cheap
5,Let's keep this simple. These are great binocs for game & bird viewing used in Kruger National Park in South Africa. The clarity is incredible especially when bird viewing and the low light works well. Although these are big binocs size & weight not an issue. Excellent value for these very good binocs. Highly recommended.
4,Truly good one from the price we paid for it. But I am still exploring trying to get more clarity on balancing. Once you have right focus  it is a great binocular. But I am finding some difficulty in focusing right.
5,I love these binoculars.  Perfect for star gazing without a bulky telescope. Doesn't replace it but a great alternative.  Built well not too heavy and comfortable to hold. Travel case dust protectors for lenses neck strap and tripod mounting bracket included. I'll use these binoculars for nature watching this summer and Bigfoot hunting from a safe distance. I am completely satisfied with purchase price and value.
5,One arrived damaged and we never returned it. The other was undamaged and worked very well. We use this equipment for shore based whale research in Northern California. We found this product extremely helpful in identifying whales at a distance too great for our 10X. They are especially useful in confirming smaller cetacean species.
5,Great value and super binoculars for the price.  I had a more expensive Bushnel pair and these blew them out of the water.  For the giant 15x70 they are very light weight and during the day are easy to hold and focus.  At night I would suggest getting a tripod to stay steady on the night sky. I highly recommend them very satisfied!!!!
3,I love the magnification and image quality for the price. But I'm disappointed that the two sides seem to be a bit misaligned on my unit and I'm out of the return period.
5,I wasn't expecting too much from these optics because of the low price; but I was very pleasantly surprised that they were sharp clear and collimated!  They are pretty large but I found that I could hand-hold these binoculars steady enough to be useful.  My wife and I looked at the winter moon the other night and we were both impressed with how much detail we could see.  These optics are a great value for the price.
5,These binoculars are the pinnacle of binoculars anything more powerful would be a telescope. They aren't too shaky just right for birdwatching or casual viewing of the Moon.  You can even see the moonshine from a couple of Jupiter's moons.
5,Very satisfied with this product I highly recommend it to anyone who likes to look at the sky at night. The only regret I have is that I didn't get the stand to hold it in place it is too difficult to view the moon without it.
5,Wow the clarity is very impressive. I live in the sunny side of US so I can see things clear and bright. The product itself is bit heavy so can't hold still or for long time. Bought aÂ   Dolica ST-500 68-Inch Lightweight Tripod        Â tripod stand but still you got to be uttermost careful in not shaking it for obvious magnification reasons otherwise objects are shaky. I absolutely love it. Yet to explore the star gazing side of it.
5,I use these to help sight wireless connections (point-to-point bridges) less than a mile. They are great for helping me to establish line of sight.  They are otherwise somewhat useless for longer duration viewing because their zoom is so extreme thus they shake a ton.
5,The SkyMaster 15x70 are very good. Not too heavy to use without a tripod but I would recommend using one anyway. The only con I have is the ill-design of the top lens cover. It doesn't seat very well with or without the rubber eye shields down. There needs to be an opening for the connecting bar piece.
4,These binoculars adjust easily.  They are the first pair I've had that allow you to adjust for the left eye then fine tune for the right eye so both see well.  THey are a bit heavy so I enjoy using a tripod for bird watching with them.
2,The Lenses are good but the quality of the binoculars aren't the best or even good for that matter. The piece you look into isn't even connected properly you can pull it out very easily.The zoom in the middle broke on me after only two uses of about 10 mins. If they didn't break right away they were good for bird watching but when I looked at the stars and moon you really can't see anything with much clarity. I'm not sure why this got such great reviews and how some people claim to see Saturn and it's rings.Overall the lenses are good and they are great for birdwatching and seeing with clarity things 1000 yds away but I don't think the quality of the binoculars are good. I was able to return them fairly easy and quickly.
5,The binoculars perform beyond my expectations. The optics are crisp and bright. I have been using them with a monopod to view birds at a local lake and they are perfect. A heavy tripod is needed for the night sky and they work well there as well. They are well made and easy to use. I would highly recommend them.
4,Loved how well objects could be picked up at such a great distance but a little too heavy for me to hold up for long. Highly recommend a stand or tripod
4,Had trouble finding channel markers even when the chart plotter was indicating they were close by. Problem solved with these high power binoculars. They do the job. Now I can spot them a mile away and be able to relax.Have not tried looking at the moon yet!
1,I bought these binoculars in October 2011.While they were working they worked fine and I was able to see fairly well at great distances.It is now July 2013. I looked through them the other day and noticed that I kept seeing double. They were NEVER dropped and always kept either at home or in the truck. These binoculars have functioned properly - for just over 1 1/2 years.I called up Celestron's customer service. On their website they say they have a limited lifetime warranty. The customer service rep who kept trying to talk over me and at first accused me of dropping them asked me to submit a $25 dollar money order in order to receive a replacement.A good set of binoculars should last much longer than this and you shouldn't have to pay more to receive a replacement for a defective product. This product is NOT durable nor reliable and the warranty policy is basically worthless. Save your money for a better set of high quality optics with a better warranty and customer service.
3,There's a spec of something possibly rubber stuck to the inside of the lens. Otherwise it works great especially for long distance viewing. I hate returning stuff so I haven't decided whether to do anything about it.
5,Excelentes binoculares muy buen alcance y su imagen es clara y nitida
4,Aside from the flimsy adapter these binoculars work great. Not so snap at focusing but manageable. Last night sweep at the Moon terminator line was breathtaking (I rested the binoculars up on a garden fence)... Excellent price considering the aperture you get.
4,I'm not an expert with binoculars.  I do like these.  I can't seem to hold them still long enough to view Venus.  I just got a tripod yesterday.  I was going to check it out last night but it was raining...maybe tonight...:->
5,First purchase was faulty.  Amazon has easy & quick return policy.  Great service from amazon.  Bought these for my wife to use on lake we live on that is 50000 acres.  Soon discovered that these are too hi quality to have banging around on the boat looking at other boats.  So now they are mounted on tripod.  Check the weight however.
5,Very good for the price it's light and have a clear view. After buying it I would prefer a little more zoom (20x) but the 15x provided makes easy to find objects and observe them without tripod.Arrived so late that I claimed as lost no problem about that Amazon sent me another via express delivery. Finally I got both and returned one.
5,It's a monster for Star gazing
1,Because of the high rating I ordered a pair of these binoculars through Amazon and they were shipped from Beach. Since I was overseas I endeavored to time the shipping with my arrival back in the USA. Unfortunately I was delayed and only got back to the USA a couple of months later. Upon initial inspection the box appeared to be in perfect condition. When I tested the binoculars however they were BADLY misaligned and the left tube was not parallel. I contacted Amazon to arrange an exchange and they directed me to Beach who were unwilling to exchange the binoculars since the replacement window of 45 days had passed. They suggested I send them to Celestron which has a lifetime warranty for $25.  Moral of the story --- These binoculars are cheaply made and as such subject to damage and/or misalignment. Rather than ordering online try to find a local supplier and test them first. Second if you order online be prepared for the hassle of returning them possibly more than one time. I won't buy another pair unless I can test them first.
5,Great for looking at the moon and stars. It was not easy but I managed to take some pictures with my phone so you can have an idea of how far this zooms in. Great clarity and easy to focus.
5,We never saw the night sky so clearly and are very happy with this purchase. One thing to note is that this already comes with a tripod adapter so you don't need to buy the extra one that they recommend you purchase. Save yourself a return.
3,The binoculars are large and somewhat heavy if you're viewing for an extended time. Mounting on a tripod is a must for stable views of celestial objects. Unfortunately the tripod mount tightening screw broke on first use. The mount itself is plastic and cannot hold these binoculars steady. Celestron sells an all metal mount for under $10.00 but the mount supplied is breakable plastic.
5,A great buy for the price.  The binoculars are unbelieveabley good for what they cost.  I have used better binoculars but they cost several time the price of these.  It is really nice to find something this reasonably priced that is worth having and using.  I have used them several times to observe the current comet and they view was better than I expected.
5,Lo que se necesita para ver las estrellas
5,Work as advertised comfortable to hold. Works fine with or without my glasses on thanks to the adjustable focus.Very high quality materials doesn't feel cheap or flimsy.Pros:Works great in low and bright light.Clear images.Easy to focus.Comes with protective caps and carrying bag.Cons:No zoom (but description does not claim it does).Heavy (recommend a tripod for long sessions).
4,The high power is very motion sensitive so much so that hand holding is next to impossible for a good look.  With a solid stand the view is pretty good with ample light getting through.
3,For the price the unit is ok. It is hard for members of my family and myself to get the lenses to align and focus together. They give us double vision like viewing. You can see the moon pretty good. The tripod adaptor works good. They are big. They did a nice job of viewing on the mountains of Colorado. The case is standard nylon. No real protection. Would I recommend this? For the price it is worth a try.
4,Star masters clarity was amazing..  But here to hold steady.. should be balanced..
5,These see everything! I use mine for astronomy but the possibilities are great. I've used mine to watch Eagles roosting in their nest about 3/4mi. Away with great clearity. Great for all around and perfect for the night sky(:
4,They are what expected but a little heavy.  I probably will not purchased again because of weight and reduced focus area.
5,For the price the magnification is fantastic. The Binoculars have the features needed to provide the user with a clear crisp image. The tripod adapter is a nice feature for those longs nights at looking at stars as the binoculars are fairly large and can be difficult for some to hold for a long duration. Also they work great at night as the name implies.
5,I got these for a white elephant we were having and I wound up with them myself.  They are great binoculars expecially with the tripod mount. I used them to sight in a scope on an AR-15.  Obviously not super long range but as binoculars go these work.  Be aware tho they are huge. Probably the biggest binoculars I have ever seen.
5,bought for birding..  much better magnification than the run of the mill binoculars but they are a bit long 12" and a bit heavier than you'd like.. bought a mono-pod for it you might do that as well.
5,Got as a present from my wife and it was a wonderful purchase.  I use mostly for stargazing but do also use for hiking/camping trips too.  Stars planets moons and nebulas are seen very clearly.  I would recommend a tripod as it will be too heavy to hold these up for long.  Good quality binoculars.
4,I like these binoculars but most of my research implied that these celestial binoculars would be powerful enough for most basic star gazing.  15X70 really isn't powerful enough for anything other than the moon or birdwatching.  But still enjoy them and they are built well.
2,These work great but are pretty fragile it seems. I took them out of storage this spring and found thefocus screw had broken.After contacting their warranty department it seems that not only do I have to pay shipping TO them I have to pay $15 via a money order (who does that?) to have them repair it even though they've admitted to it being covered under warranty.Steer clear buy from a company that has a good warranty.
5,Very good clarity balance & magnification. I don't have to use a tripod. It has an armorized type of rubberized coating on the body of these binoculars. For the price this Celestron SkyMaster Giant 15x70 is a bargain.  I highly recommend this item.  The only downside is the consistantly very poor delivery service of "FedEx express" in Honolulu Hawaii.
5,When you try to look for a single star its hard to find because your looking past it !These work so good for looking at the stars !I can even see Jupiter and it's four biggest moons !This is better than my brother's  telescope ! (he paid $800 for his telescope)I have recomended this to all my friends and family.thanks
4,These binoculars provide a good tool for night timesky viewing.  Easier to carry than a telescope withthe advantage of using both eyes.  The tripod mountcan be used with most any tripod with a standard screw mount.The 15 power makes hand holding a challenge but with practicethey work great.
4,Optics and field were very good.  I took the advise of a previous buyer and filled the tripod adapter with epoxy and it worked. the adapter is almost worthless as is. won't hold the binocks steady.  Good value for the money. I use them for birds and star gazing.
5,These binoculars are heavy but not too heavy to hold steadily. The optics are clean and collimated and provide a good view of many larger deep-sky objects from my backyard. Eye relief is adequate for my daughter to use them while wearing her eyeglasses.I would not want to take these binoculars backpacking (due to the weight) but they have been ideal at sporting events on a road trip and for wide field astronomy.
5,Arrived on timeNo damageEasy to use and understandMuch nicer than I anticipatedThey did all that was advertised. The 15X power pushes the limit for hand held but perfect on tripod or otherwise supported. I use them hand held often but grow tired of trying to steady them. Lots of concentration. Lower power or stabilization would be nice for long term use.
3,I bought these binoculars for their 15X power. They work OK but I'm a little disappointed with the sharpness of the image. I couldn't find these anywhere to try before buying but more expensive binoculars I did try definitely provided a sharper image - better optics I guess.The tripod adapter works well but contrary to some warnings holding these in your hands for use presents no real problems - they are not excessively heavy.
5,I purchased the 15x70 Celestron Skymaster Binoculars primarily for astronomical viewing. they arrived in perfect shape without any collimation problems.  the binoculars are bright and clear with a very good image quality. The 15x70 Skymasters are perfect for stargazing.
5,Great price on these binocs. Almost too big to use by hand but I haven't had to buy a tripod yet. Think my girlfriend would like to try a tripod as her hands aren't quite as steady but no complaints yet. She's uses these to whale watch and you can see pretty far with them. Biggest size you should probably go without a tripod.
5,These binoculars are amazinh not only are.the.great for.skeet birdwatching and.sightseeing they really shine at.nigh. The moon looked incredible.up close this is as good as any beginner telescope. I can read the name of airline on.the sides.of.planes way up in sky. I can count craters.on moon. So happy I read reviews and bought this. Taking it camping with me at Yosemite cannot wait!
5,Prue and simple - these are just great fun for about $60.  Very clear easy to focus fun to use.  No way an expert - just a guy who likes to watch hawks eagles and critters without spending a lot of money.  The full moon looks really cool as well.  They are big and a little heavy but I knew that going in - well worth the bucks!
4,Excellent optics I'm seeing things that are really fantastic.  Just wish I knew what I was looking at up in the night sky.  These binoculars really bring out the light when star gazing and with a half to full moon it is beautifully lit up.
5,I bought these to star gaze from the back porch.  Wanted to get a little closer than those with less magnification.  Well these are great for such an affordable price.  you can see Orion's belt and some other farther away stars you can't see with less magnification.  We use them all the time and have been very happy with the results.
4,Good binoculars but too big and extremely heavy
5,These are very big binoculars. Not ones you'd carry on a hike. I did end up getting a tripod because you can't really hold them steady in your hands. But the clarity and distance you can see makes them a win in my book for the price.
5,Todo tal cual como se diÃ³ en la descripciÃ³n
5,These are excellent binoculars. I had my doubts that an instrument with such a modest price would have the quality I want. But I know others who've had Celestron scopes and whatnot and the quality was always good and besides the price is so modest--I could afford to take a chance. They did it--matched low price with high quality. Who'd have thunk?
5,Good quality for a reasonable price.
5,We purchased these binoculars after a recent trip to Yellowstone and in anticipation of our return to Yellowstone!  They are fantastic!  The arrived precisely when the vendor said they would they arrived very well packed and protected from the shipper and the elements!  We love them!  They are an exceptionally well priced item and I would recommend this product AND THE THE VENDOR to anyone contemplating such a purchase!  Thank you.
5,Oh yeah been wanting star gazing binoculars since I found they are better for beginner star gazers I made the correct choice with going with 15x70 after many comparisons...can use my glasses and look with both eyes Not one eye as wit telescopes. Yes yu hv to need Tripod. Binos are large. BUT BETTER TO SEE WITH!
5,I went on a trip to Bryce Canyon area of Utah.  We looked at stars for five nights in a row.  The binoculars are great for star gazing.  I am sure there are better binoculars with better optics but for $70 I was really happy.
5,These binoculars are incredible. I bought them for checking out the night sky and these performed much better than expected. I do recommend one thing: buy the tripod with them. I bought without the tripod and your arms will get tired and the view will get shaky from your tired arms. Spend the extra few bucks and get the tripod.
5,Loved the power of them and the clear image.
5,Purchased as Christmas gift for brother-in-law. He absolutely loved them. Can see such detail of moon with them it's impressive. Highly recommend! Would definitely buy again.
1,On it's way right back.Out of the box:1. Collimation way off2. Focus wheel non-functional apparently stripped or broken. I was able to move the eyepiece section by hand in and out.3. Lenses had fine scratches.4. Lenses did not appear to be even from middle to outer edges for clear image. But this may be normal not sure.Had read many reviews about collimation issues and was hoping for the best but no luck for me. Only option was return; no replace option. May look at another brand but not confident about buying any binocular now online without being able to look through the actual pair before buying.I understand that Celestron has a good warranty but I'm not about to ship a brand new item to them for repair. These should be QC'd before they go out the door.I will maybe look at local shops for a decent pair for some basic stargazing.
2,Bad purchase for me and I returned it immediately.  The focus did not work.  The focus dial was not attached to the lens.  I could have used them by pulling the small lens in and out for the focus but that was not the way it was manufactured and I did not have the confidence it would have lasted very long doing it that way.  Also Amazon I wanted to exchange it for a different more expensive pair of binoculars but you did not offer than option so I just got the refund.  Your loss.
5,I look up at the sky on almost every clear night.  As a complete amateur my most enjoyable moments are while looking at the moon -- can't identify constellations yet.  Had to buy a Barska tripod adapter to handle the weight on my tripod the plastic one that came with the binos was too fragile.
5,My father is an amateur bird watcher he said he wanted binoculars for Christmas I was afraid I would not be able to afford them i was also worried id buy the wrong ones. When my dad opened these on xmas morning he was so happy! He said they have the perfect weight to them and his arms won't get tired! Perfect for the wildlife lover!
3,Does the job but the alignment of the two scopes is off just a hair which produces two images instead of one. Kind of annoying! I didn't use it right away and notice it soon enough to return it for an exchange so I'll just deal with it.
4,A upgrade and I am still discovering new features.
5,Excellent binoculars!!
5,I am very pleased with these binoculars. I compared them with other 15x70 binoculars at a recent product show and found these much easier to handle because of the relative light weight. The quality of the optics seems to be excellent and thus far has performed extremely well for astronomy. Coupled with the excellent price at Amazon this was an outstanding purchase. The same binoculars at the product show were 30-40% more in price.
5,Very pleased with this product. Purchased for granddaughter as a beginner tool for star gazing. After an abundance of research settled on this product. Not disappointed. Little tricky to figure out how to mount on tripod adapter but once done great experiences gazing at the stars & watching the birds.
2,These were great at first but with light use and indoor storage they still began to decompose. Now we have gummy sticky plastic and chunks falling off. Had to throw them out since the warranty is only two years. I have binoculars I inhered from my grandfather that still work so I cannot understand how these could be produced to last only that long.
4,Great binoculars but a little unhappy with the caps that cover the objective lens. They don't have a snug fit so the caps always fall off. I lost one already actually.
4,i got these in 2 days when i bought them!.i got it on of the box and all i can think about with the lengthits big! i mean i thought it was cool. u sireously NEED a tripod! trust me!.but i think this is endless fun!
5,It functions like it is supposed to.  Only drawback is little too big and too heavy.  I want a powerful binocular so it should be big and heavy so I have no negative things to say.  I strongly recommend it.
5,These are great value for the money!  I have used them several years for astronomy.  But they are too heavy to hand-hold.  If you have a good tripod they will give you excellent views.  If you aren't going to buy or build a suitable tripod I recommend that you look for binoculars with image stabilization.
4,I purchased these for watching the wild game on our property.  They work excellent to give us a close and clear view of the animals.  I have not attempted star gazing with them.  The only drawback I find is that everyone complains that they are too heavy.
4,Get a tripod or field stick. These are heavy. I'm replacing the neck strap with a padded camera strap.These are a good price for the quality.
3,They are okay. Magnification is not great. Do not expect to see the rings on Saturn. I was able to spot a couple of galaxies but FYI they just look like blurry blobs. My suggestion would be to spend the extra money and get some that are more powerful.
5,They are a little big and cumbersome but I don't take them out when I travel some where like ( ball game or concertect.). I primarily use them in my own back yard for wild life and great for looking in the sky at night. I live in the country on a hill and no night lighting.
5,considering the price of $50.00.this is a slam dunk steal.i know several customers had collimation problemsbut i think that had to do with rough handling on the shippers part.my bino's came in perfect ready to go condition. the images were very clearright out to the edges.my guess would be that you'd have to spend at least 2 io 3x as much for a better pair.
5,I can see forever.  Yes they are heavy but I can see waves crashing on rocks about 12 miles away.  I bought them to whale watch from our hotel balcony.
5,I bought these for a trip to Alaska where I skippered a 42' Nordic Tug for 12 days in the large waters west of Juneau. The binoculars proved to be much more useful than I had anticipated.  I used them multiple times a day for ship siting animal viewing etc.  They were an important tool for the success of the cruise.
3,These binocs were crystal clear for terrestrial viewing however its flaws showed up in astronomical viewing (for which I mostly purchased these). It has decent lenses and construction however my set needed a tiny amount of collimating to achieve pinpoint resolution at night and the supplied tripod mount is very wobbly! When I replaced that with a steel one from Barska the view improved.
5,Wow!  Are these binoculars powerful!!  I did my research online and selected the Celestron SkyMaster Giant and I couldn't be happier.These binoculars are the most powerful of all that I have purchased.
4,Must have been a fluke the binoculars work just fine.
5,qe do bird photography and this set is perfect for both birding as well as wildlife at a distant
4,They're my first pair of binoculars so i can't compare them. Anyway i am very happy with the purchase . The view of the sky is very enjoyable and crisdtal clear.For the price is it a bargain.Highly recommended.
3,I chose the 3 star rating just because the product came to me with bad collimation (I was seeing double) and therefore I do not know if these binos are great average or poor quality.  The bad collimation was probably caused by a jolt to them in the shipping process.  Binoculars probably should not be purchased mail order - the shipping process tends to knock them out of collimation.
4,She is always whale watching along the Pacific Coast so I got her these babies. She had a few 7x50 Binocs sets in her car but those have gone the way of the Dodo since she got these.Very Nice!
4,I was wondering what was good for stargazing. I thought this must be great so we bought it.It is Great for stargazing! But it is frigile even on soft pillows! This thing works well with a tripod! If you like stargazing this is the one you must buy!
5,We bought these for this spring when Yellowstone opens for the season. Just got back from Yellowstone and loved them it made the experience so much better for distant viewing. We bought two pair and had no problems either of them. Got many comments when we let other folks use them. Were very open on where we got them. Thanks
4,For the price these are great binoculars. I only use them on occasion so they suit my needs well. Not a binocular aficionado by any stretch but these seem like a great pair to me.
4,Very good set of binos for the price you pay.  Only issue is that the cover for the eye piece doesn't fit very well at all and keeps slipping off.  That's the only thing that prevents it from getting 5 stars.  Highly recommended.
4,I GOT TO SEE THE MOONS OF JUPITER WITH THESE. I USE THESE EVERY TIME I GO STAR GAZING ALONG WIT MY TELESCOPE
2,I found that the binoculars were out of collimation and returned them to Amazon and requested a replacement pair. I received the replacement and found that the collimation was even worse than I had experienced with the first pair. I requested another replacement. Amazon sent me an Email that stated that the problems they are having with these binoculars are greater than they realized and that they would be sending me a refund rather than another replacement. I am very impressed with the way Amazon has handled this. They sent me the replacement pair even before I had returned the defective pair. They even covered all of the return postage. I will definately continue to purchase from Amazon.
4,They seem more powerful. They are a little heavy.
1,I bought these binoculars because of the great reviews.  Living in Costa Rica it is very difficult to return things or I certainly would.  In addition to the knowledgeable review written by M.M. Vance regarding collimation (which make my binoculars worse than useless...they make you dizzy) I will add that the binoculars are extremely uncomfortable.  The light shields around the eye pieces are very hard and don't flex into your eye socket.  You can fold the shields out of the way but then you can't block side light.  The binoculars are heavy and basically useless without a tripod even if they weren't out of cullimation.  The rubber protectors for both ends of the binoculars don't fit.  The small protectors to cover the eye pieces don't even closely fit and you have to push them out of shape to make them "fit". The covers that protect the objective lens fall off if you just shake the binoculars lightly in your hands.  Not a good purchase at any price!
3,These are great but it took me 3 orders to get a pair that worked.  I think the problem is simply the packaging does not protect these well enough and causes them to arrive in semi broken condition.  Over all tho i'd say these are a HUGE value.  The product is excellent Amazon's customer service is top notch but the packaging needs work for shipping protection.
5,Crystal clear. I am not an expert at binoculars and I purchased this unit to upgrade an old pair I have had for approximately 30 years. This pair is much more powerful (Objects appear much closer) than they did with my older pair.
4,Good with this price  I use in Mexico  Puerto Vallarta from the balcony to the Mismaloya beach   to see the little boat take tourist go ...  good for 1/2 or 3/4 mile away  Nam Le
5,These binoculars are fantastic.  Great for watching wildlife as well as the night sky.  They are large. but well balanced and are rubber-coated to ensure a solid grip.  They do have a tripod mount for even better stability. Comes with a robust case and lens caps.
5,I ordered the binoculars to look at the sea life on the water and they work great.  I am able to see fish flipping seals and other marine life.  It is also great to look at the stars.  I saw the moons around jupiter.  I am planning to take them on a cruise to look out over the sea and the sky.  It fits on a tripod which works great.  Overall I am very pleased.
3,Great product except there's this line inside the lens about 1.5 inches. So when I look at the moon for example you'll see the little line. I did not contact seller to have it replaced and spend shipping again for something like that. I don't use it that often anyway
5,Great for looking at stars. I can even see Jupiter's moons so I'm happy. I just wish I wasn't so shaky. They're a bit bigger than I thought they would be so I can't carry them around as easily as I would like. I plan to take them with me on a hike soon.
5,I am a novice to binoculars.  I must say that I am very pleased with my purchase.  The quality surpassed my expectations and my family and I have already enjoyed hours of use.  Star gazing and wildlife viewing have become new hobbies in our home.  My only regret is that I didn't purchase these much sooner.
1,The product I received couldn't be collimated.  This was the first and last Celestron product I will purchase.The product I received was defective.  No question about that.  So why take it out on Celestron when defective products are common these days?Astronomy is a difficult hobby to begin with.  When you think "hey I just want to spend $60 and try this out" and the result is miserable chances are that will be the last $60 you will spend and then you will find another hobby.You are rolling the dice if you purchase these.  Go ahead if $60 isn't anything to you.
4,The plastic thumbscrew on the adapter broke when I took it out of the wrapping but the binoculars themselves are great. Just buy a different tripod adapter with it.
5,I love these they work so well.  I tested them not long after I recieved them and they worked exactly how I wanted.  I will be taking them with me to a Dark Sky Reserve in a few weeks and I will use them nightly to see the stars.
4,So far I love them. I have not had a chance to look at the night sky yet. But I am hoping for great things with these.
5,I use this to sight in my rifles at 200+ yards. These binoculars are such a better buy than most spotting scopes. And with the included tripod adapter this is a no-brainer. Love it.Came with rubberized lens cover strap for carrying cloth for cleaning lenses and a nice case (again with straps) to carry.
5,My wife and I have been using these binoculars for several months now and we are blown away.  Last week we used these to spot Andromeda and four of Jupiter's moons in very bad light pollution.  The magnification is obviously not as great as a telescope's but the portability and ease of use make up for that easily.
5,Nice for the price Iâm a firm believer in you pay for what you get. But thier not bad the price
3,I rated it as 'ok' because it is good for viewing the moon for some people but not for people with close set eyes. If you have close set eyes like I do this isn't going to work that great for you. I also can't get both sides to focus perfectly. I kinda wish I never got them because I can't really enjoy them.
5,I'm no professional astronomer by any means.  I got these because they were cheap and well regarded. Between these binoculars the StarWalk app on my iPhone and a camera tri-pod I've had a ton of fun.Last night I could see faintly four of the moons of Jupiter (from a rooftop in Brooklyn no less).As a beginner I'm very happy with these.
3,Great magnification horrible mount.  The weight of these binoculars are way too much for the plastic mount.  Do not buy if you intend to use the included mount to set up on a tripod.
3,This piece of bino is quite large and not one that you can handily bring along on field trips unless you have bag space and is willing to withstand the weight.One thing that puzzles me : When i looked to items afar i realised that the images are horizontally inverted. Is it just me or is the item faulty?Not too sure about this.
4,They are very nice binoculars however very heavy.. it is supposed to have a tripod connector though I can not find it to save my life..  I imagine I will have to contact Celestron and figure this out
5,High powered binoculars at a great price.
3,Works fine for daylight viewing - had a double image for nighttime use- there is an adjustment that can be made under the rubber of the handholds that will align the images - did the adjustment but have not yet tried nighttime viewing.  Seems like a pretty good binocular for the price.  Powerful enough that holding steady is not exactly easy.
5,I bought these for only around 50 bucks when there as good as a pair of 100 dollar binoculars. It was so well packaged and in perfect condition. And they aren't only for long distance but also designed for star gazing! These are so good the first time I used these I could see a deer on top of a hill miles away from my house!
3,Nice Binos however you get double vision with them.They are a little heavy but if you hold them towards the end they are easily held in place.The strap is junk...Cheap and not wide enough as it cuts into your neck when worn.The caps on the end are easy to lose since they dont have a string or something to hold them.
5,This is perfect!!! i love them you can see in the day anything as far as the circunference of the Earth lets you. During the night you can see the stars you can't see with your own eyes. I love it and my dad too!!
3,My pair of binoculars came and was very excited after reading prior reviews and expecting a great night of viewing a little disappointed. I viewed Jupiter but couldn't get the resolution some reviewers claimed they got. The center focus makes it difficult to get the sharpness I was looking for may need to play around with it more. I don't think this product deserves 5 stars
4,The view magnification general design are all positive features of this star gazing tool- but the binoculars themselves are slightly heavy  They make it a little difficult to hold completely steady and really get lost in the stars.
5,I love these scopes! They just got here and I have a nice view of red rocks from my patio in downtown denver and can see it in perfect detail. Can't wait to look at the moon in a few hours.
5,It was a gift for my father. He loves them so does the rest of the family. I am gonna get another pair for one of my relatives.
5,Fantastic binoculars. I have not complain about this product and I really recommend for stargazing
4,These binoculars are well worth the money and Amazon had the best price on the web. If you want something more versatile that a scope these will fit the bill. You will need a sturdy tripod lightwieght tripod won't get the job done..
5,Thank you
5,The best binoculars ive ever had. Well worth the price i have no complaints but my wife says they are too big. But thats what she says...
5,Great value for the cost. Do not buy them without a tripod or something to hold them steady.  Fairly good optics and easy to use.  I use them a lot looking around the night sky while waiting for the skies to darken before using my telescope.
4,Very heavy duty Binos with a great field of view.
4,Great magnification a little heavy but that's to be expected in this price ranges
5,I recently became interested in astronomy and bought these binoculars to acclimate myself prior to buying a telescope.  These are perfect for the casual person who likes to look at the night sky.  They are not limited to night time use.  If the conditions are right you can see brilliant detail of the craters on the moon.  I use them every night and love them.
5,Very good binoculars for the price. fast delivery and it does every it said. would i recomment them to others yes i would.
4,Great quality binoculars. They have great power! We can see tons of stars and people in their downtown apartments several blocks away. They get a little heavy after a while so it is nice to use a tripod.
4,Ordered on 11-22-11 and they arrived within a week. Binoculars were exactly as described. They work GREAT though a little on the heavy side. Just use the tripod adapter and you can use them for hours. Great price for a really good product.
4,Highly recommend these. Great for star gazing or observing wildlife.
5,These are a wonderful pair of binoculars and you cannot beat the fabulous price.  They are a little on the heavy side but I would not let that get in the way of purchasing these again.  We can't wait until the summer comes and we can lay on the grass and look up at the sky.  They are a gem for land viewing as well.  Great buy!
5,Wow...such a great deal.  Nicely weighted appear collimated OK decent ergonomics debossed into the rubber surround material and decent objectives.  OK case and accessories.  Feel very good in hands and VERY bright optics - heck im used to 7x50s Steiners and these destroy 'em in many areas.  Thanks again AMAZON - nicely done.
4,For the cost of the item it functions well. It is not a high end item and has no where near the clarity of my Zeiss binoculars but for bird whale and star gazing it works as advertised.
4,If your looking for true astronomical binoculars these will disappoint because the magnification is not sufficient but if you want a pair of binocs that can give great terrestrial viewing (with optical quality) over and above standard binocs and can provide good views of common large sky objects at a steal of a price jump on these.
5,After researching for long time and after deciding the type of the instrument we chose Celestron SkyMaster Giant 15X70.  The user is very happy with them. Celestron binoculars.  We could watch the very last Moon Eclipse.  We use them to watch birds the ships on the sea horizon and to look at far away objects.  Excellent quality Binoculars.  Ease of use Good price.
5,I use these for stargazing. The 15x magnification is strong enough to see the moon in great detail. Good for viewing the Orian nebula the 3 kings pleiades & the moons orbiting Jupiter.Really good for just a quik peek around the night sky especially when you don't feel like lugging a full size telescope around.Don't forget the tripod!!
5,A little big but very light.husband loves it
5,I'm very satisfied because my husband is very happy!  It was his anniversary gift for our 35th wedding Anniversary.  Thank you!
5,We recently purchased and used these binoculars on a trip to Colorado--Mesa Verde and Black Canyon of the Gunnison.  Amazing resolution and great for star gazing as well.  Our only complaints are that they seem to be a bit heavy plus the product does not come with a hard case which would be a wise investment.  But for less than $70 these are very minor issues.
4,The left and right tubes are difficult to line up at this size so they were like having crossed-eyes. But they are more like two small telescopes. Very clear and bright. I have even seen the moons of Jupiter with them. Great price I paid $55.
5,I was not expecting such a large pair of binoculars.  Weight wise though they weigh far less that the 40 year old 4 power binocular they replaced.  We watched the moon eclipse with them and were very please with the viewing optics.
5,They weigh a ton but I can see half-way around the world. We actually use them to look at craters on the moon. A+++
4,The optics aren't crystal clear but for the price I am quite satisfied.
4,Good buy for amatuers
5,The best binoculars you can buy!!! They are awesome for nightsky viewing and just daytime use. I would tell anyone who is looking for a good pair to buy these. You cant beat the price! Even if they break which i am quite confident in their durability it is not a big loss.
3,The optics are truly amazing for the price. The field is wide the image is bright razor sharp and with fine contrast and color rendition. My complaint is with the center focusing mechanism which tends to drift and requires constant attention. This problem could have been easily fixed at the factory with a properly sized washer to take out the play in the center focusing knob. I hope Celestron gets the message and takes the last small step to make these binoculars just right.
5,These are great for those of us who are interested in astronomy but don't want to drag a telescope around with us all the time.  They don't take up much space the view is excellent and the price is right.  I would recommend getting a stand for them though as they can be a bit difficult to keep steady after holding them for a while.
5,The tripod-mount-adapter is terrible - all plastic / sure to break / wobbles.  You'll want one made of steel.  The binoculars themselves are an excellent value...
2,You can adjust this until you're blue in the face but you'll still see double of everything. Reading some of the other poor reviews the double image not only seems to be a persistent problem but one that hasn't be fixed by the company. Maybe it's the optics or some sort of manufacturing problem but on some models no amount of fine tuning will get rid of the double vision. Otherwise if I look through either my left or right eye with the other closed the image seems fine. But that's why they sell telescopes isn't it?
4,I like them very much but the review of the item was a bit deceiving . I thought these binoculars had the zoom lever on them and they do not. That was a feature I wanted.
5,I was extremely surprised with the size and quality of these binoculars.  I tried viewing a full moon one night and it was crystal clear.  The only problem was that it was a little shaky.  I guess that is to be expected so I'll be buying a stand to go with it.  Overall a great purchase!
4,Easy to focus and actually very good except not knowing much about Bins I was expecting a closer view going from 10X'sto 15 but..excellent Bins....Just want more closeness on viewing Birds at a distance & Clear
4,It's certainly not the best but for the price it could be very well be as good as it gets. Just keep in mind this is a powerful zoom binoculars you will need steady hands or a tripod.
5,I LOVE MY SkyMaster Giant.  Received the product without any needed adjustment and everything works great  Have fashioned  my own Binocular strap from a unused laptop bag and it works just great.  The tripod adapter leaves a lot to be desired.  Black plastic and wobbly.  Wish I had bought a better adapter.
4,Celestial binoculars but my husband likes them. Big and heavy but he has big hands.
5,The only draw back to these is the lens covers are crap aside from that these things are everything I hoped they would be. I watched a coyote the other day that was way out in a farm field and the definition was fantastic. If you can get over the lens cover thing these are well worth the cost.
5,These are fantastic for viewing stars.  I have seen star clusters and even faint nebula's through them (looks like a small blurry spot - but still!).  They give the user a very wide view.  Fantastic! Works great with a tripod!
5,Works great
1,Beware of these binoculars I have had the same experience that G. Roche had on page 2. The first pair came and were out of collimation so I filled out an RMA request form and sent them back. They sent me a second pair and it was worse than the first. You would think they would at least inspect them for that problem before they send the second pair out...right?  Not to mention the cost of freight. So here I sit with a second pair of binoculars that don't work and if I do send them back and pay the freight again I will  for sure get back another pair with the same problem. I could have spent the same amount of money once you include the freight twice and gotten a better pair of binoculars. I will tell you this I am NOT buying another pair over the internet.  I will go to the store and try them out before I purchase again.
5,Arrived on time and was very well packaged. I reallylike them the one and only negative thing I can come withis they are heavy. they are very strong and awesome for landuse but for looking at stars or planets you need to brace themreally well or better yet use a tripod.
3,Right eye piece was not attached to the binoculars aand I wasn't comfortable gluing it on myself. Body had scratches as if it were refurbished. Product was returned.
4,....you need a tripod to focus clearly on distant objects like star or moon gazing. Great clarity and detail at a great distance observing nature on the ground or in the trees.
4,These are excellent binoculars.  Very easy to use.  Only negative is the weight.  I knew when I bought them that they weighed 3#'s.  Hard to keep still while using.  Strongly recommend a tri-pod.  Sorry I didn't shop more and pay a little extra for a smaller binocular.
5,tried it out was as expected. a bit on the heavy you'll need a good tripod. mine was a bit light. the tripod was great for heavy camera but tripped over when I attached the Celestron. so now Im buying a tripod enjoyed the Celestron view
5,Enjoy looking at the moon with these. A little hard to steady by hand but that's to be expected with a pair this size.
5,Great high-powered binocs.  Need a tripod or some kind of rest to use them... not worth much otherwise.  But clear bright and amazing when properly supported.  An amazing value for the price!
5,Great picture quality and magnification. Can be used both for land and sky. Only disadvantage is the weight and size.
4,A decent pair of binoculars for the price. My first pair was out of collimation so I sent them back and my second pair was great I wish celestron would have directions for collimation.
4,Nice build and quality for the price. Very big binoculars in person I must say!Only downside is lens alligment seems a bit off.
5,Great product for the price! The quality is good. Used them for outdoor viewing and they work great. They are like normal binoculars on steroids. Amazed at the magnification. Have not been able to do any sky viewing with them yet as it has been quite cloudy but looking forward to it.
5,These are perfect for beginners that are on a budget. I can take them on the road and fit well on my tripod without balancing issues.
4,Nice binoculars! The case is a little too small and the lens caps are a little too big(don't fit snug) but still a good buy.
5,Great value for the price
5,first time to buy large binoculars and not an expert by no means but if being able to see clearly a long long way down the street means they are good i'm completely satisfied. looking forward to getting to the big bend area this weekend.
5,If you have a steady hand then these are for you! I can't quite figure out yet how to mount them but just being able to bring them out for a quick look at Jupiters moons made the purchase worth it.Only complaint is the bottom lens caps seem to fall off and are not a good fit.
5,However need a steady hand to view the night sky though NO FAULT of the binoculars.
4,Very satisfied. Took on vacation toTN. Excellent! Re-purchased as a Christmas gift for a friend.
5,You can see the end of the universe with these ....almost . You can see the moon and caters and all kinds of stuff that I can't remember the names of. And they work great at the beach for the land based heavenly bodies .
4,great
4,I like these a lot the only reason they are not 5 stars is weight.
5,these are great  binoculars! had a pair of 10x50 and they just didn't have enough strength. These are very stron and can see for miles.
5,Se ve increÃ­ble sÃºper nÃ­tido
5,My niece's boyfriend wanted an inexpensive telescope for night sky gazing. I convinced her to get a set of powerful binoculars instead. He is really flipped over these. Great product at a great price. No regrets.
5,Great price - Great binoculars: was nervous after reading some low reviews about the optics not being set up properly from the factory but these arrived and look great. Cant beat the price and the build quality seems pretty good too. Simple case and lens covers are minimal but effective.
5,These are very good binoculars! I was really impressed with them when I tried them out. Should op for a tripod if you plan on using them for a long period of time. They get kinda heavy and hands can shake while holding them.
5,Bought for bird watching from my porch. Bright sharp images. Great magnification. A bit heavy to carry around. I use them with a tripod. Pulls in ospreys from across the cove as if in my front yard.
5,Bueno
1,I bought Celestron as a reputable brand of consumer astronomical equipment!  Out-of-the-box the binoculars gave two images.  The collimation was bad.  Turns out that there is a strong thread on the Internet about Skymaster collimation problems.  I found Internet instructions to collimate with hidden screws on the binoculars.  That worked for a short while.  On a cold night collimation was lost again.  I waited too long to return these.  They now sit on my shelf a testimony to a bad purchase.
4,pretty good images  for the price they are certainly adequate if not outstanding .  i certainly do not worry letting my grandson hold them as i would with 1200 dollar lenses
5,I can see Jupiter and 3 of its moons clearly! I would recommend either having a tripod or investing in one if stargazing is your reason for wanting these. They're not too heavy for bird watching but when you look up at the stars it is much nicer to have these resting on something.
5,They work very well even for field glasses on my lake. They are heavy and not to be packed around. Looking at the moon they are as good as less expensive telescopes. You do need to stableize them with tri pod or pole. Work very well for what I wanted just viewing from my deck.
3,Binoculars work fine but no tripod adapter included.  When we called we were told we needed to get it from the tripod people.  The tripod people said they only had adapters for cameras.  I am very confused right now.
5,In love with my Celestron!!
4,These are very powerful binoculars.  Just one word of warning they are heavy.  If you are going to use them for a long period  use a tripod or rest them on something.
5,Great binoculars for the price! Paid a lot less then a certain local store. My son loved it! If you are looking for binoculars at a great price this is it!
5,These things are great I work in an office building with a nice view of the water. I can now see boats up close and check out what's going on.Makes a great distraction when I get tired of spreadsheets.
5,Had these for awhile and they are great. A little heavy. Good field of view. Dont realy notice any fogging of the lens. Good tool for finding the general area of that deep space object your trying find. I can see this being a good starting point for someone that doesn't have a scope but wants to learn the night sky.
5,This arrived today and we get a fantastic view of the moon. Looking forward to seeing the stars when it's not cloudy. I can't believe how close we can see the moon. Great buy!
4,Strong glasses good field of veiw easy to find object clear doesn't break the bank !
5,These are wonderful for backyard astronomers. The view is clear and they are easy to use. I like them better than a telescope. They are best used with a good tripod but can be hand held for a short time too.
4,Just what I expected - Great deep sky viewing clarity and the tripod mount for extended viewing.  Was surprised by how the binoculars are.  Great price from Amazon.
1,Save your money go buy something a little better than this.  The first two I received were out of collimation and finally the third one I received didn't have issues with collimation or "double vision."  I've been using these for a few months now being careful to transport them inside the car on the seat when going out to observe but they're already out of collimation.  Others in my astronomy club have had the same issues.  I've had to rip off the rubber grips to access the collimation screws so we'll see how difficult it'll be to recollimate these now.  If it doesn't work well I'll just throw them away.  If it does work there's no way to replace the rubber grips I had to pull off.
2,Got mine yesterday. Nice multicoatings on the objective oenses but the eye lenses were just single-coating mfg2. No idea about the prisms. I immediately took them outside to check and found the left ocular to be excellent - but the right ocular would not come to focus. Checking from the objective side I could see that it was not collimated (in this case the prism were not correctly oriented) and I could see the cutoff when looking directly into the lens at the center. UPS is picking them up today for a return (refund only no exchange allowed). Too bad as they are pretty lightweight and hand-holdable especially if you are sitting or leaning against something.
4,I found these binoculars to be of good quality and great optical clarity considering the price.  I would recommend them to anybody looking for an affordable pair of binoculars in this price range.
3,First of all I like the binoculars for their optics and star gazing.  However the ability to attach it to a tripod is unclear at best.  There is no manual included and I could not find one online.  While the binoculars are excellent the adaptor was a deciding factor with my purchase so I am disappointed in this area.
4,Was expecting a bit more but still awesome regardless.
5,First binoculars i have bought.  They work great . They are somewhat heavy and you do need a steady hand . Bought a tripod for it and worked great. Good price too fee really sturdy
4,The large 70mm lenses gather light well with resolution even in low light. Able to hand hold and even more stable when a tripod is used. Good for celestial as well as terrestrial viewing.
4,One does need a tripod with these. It does come with the adapter.
1,These binoculars did not arrive collimated properly. One lens was fuzzy no matter how I adjusted them. Since it costs more than the price of the binoculars to have them properly collimated by a professional I had to send them back. This was very disappointing as I had high hopes for them. Apparently you have to spend $800-1200 to get a quality pair of binoculars so I will have to put this hobby on the back-burner for now.
5,These are really great binoculars for the price. We were able to see the radio tower on the mountain by our home which is quite far away. You definitely need a tripod for distance though. At high magnification things wobble quite a bit.Very happy with this set. Large. Light. Strong. 5 stars.
5,Muy recomendable
5,lots of reviews here say you should use a tripod ....I just got this and went to my local lake and can see across it just holding these ...no shaking and a very very clear sight!!!! under $100 ya cant go wrong!!!
4,I had to adjust to each eyehaving a bad left eye but eventually got good distant vision.
4,Great binoculars for the price. Tripod mount needs some work does not hold the binoculars level. It need some form of keyway groove to lock the position.
5,I can see the cloud in Orion's belt with these binoculars. They are quite large though so I suggest a tripod or I use them while lying on my back so that I can support my arms while holding them.
5,I was skecptable of these when buying for such low price but wow they are great for the money cant be beat imoIve been using them for spotting scopes for target shooting and looking at airplanes and they have a great view of a watertank thats about 5 miles from my house
5,Wow. I have not used them yet in the field as they are a gift but I can't wait until I can. The weight is perfect the reviews show it's got some good quality to it and it seems really powerful for this price point. I could not be happier.
5,These were great glasses.  Unfortunately they don't work anymore.  I tripped on a throw rug hit the tripod and over it went breaking the glasses.  I'm glad Amazon keeps a record of what I bought so someday I can get another pair.
5,Love them  Very bright viewing and nice magnification. They have enough weight to them to help make them more stable when hand holding them but they do work best with a tripod. The larger optics gather lots of light and they work great even in low light in the evening.
5,I just bought my second pair.  First ones got dropped and broken.... Waah!  The quality of the optics are very good for the price.  I recommend using the tripod adaptor for long distance viewing and stargazing.  There's enough weight to them that holding them still is a challenge.  I love them just the same.
5,I use these for viewing the sun (with filters) and for star gazing.  The wide field of view makes it easy to find my target.  The magnification rivals some of the less expensive telescopes as I can easily view Jupiter and its moons and Orion's nebula.
4,vision very good for distance
5,Impressed with these. I got them to look out over the Delaware river from a mounted tripod. I do want a little more power but they are a bargain for what they offer.  I'm new to the binocular market so I can't really compare this to anything else.
5,After reading many reviews and trying different binoculars these outperformed everything up to three times the price. At 3.3 pounds they can tire your arms for long viewing but lying down looking up solves the problem. Their relative field of view is roughly the space between two of the stars in the Big Dipper handle.
4,These binoculars are long as hell when you look at something you are already half way there.  Really need a tripod with these binoculars.
5,Absolutely stunning optics for the night sky. They are heavy so you'll want to use a tripod for any gazing at the sky. One warning - the tripod adapter is plastic and you'll want to get the aluminum tripod adapter from Alpen [...] The plastic adapter is likely to wobble because of the weight of the binoculars. Highly recommended.
5,If you are involved with target shooting out to 100yds or farther this is an excellent buy.....already have a spotting scope but this well exceeds this. Might be somewhat more inconvenient but the ability to see small target imprints from small bullets at long ranges well reflects it abilities....an excellent price and VALUE.
2,I bought these to see a launch in Florida.  When I got them they first seemed like they'd be perfect until I noticed that the images were not aligned properly (vertically) resulting in a double image effect.  I could correct it by applying a twisting pressure on the the lens then the image was awesome but obviously I couldn't do that all the time especially if I wanted to use at night on a tripod.  Sadly I had to return them which really sucks.
4,Excellent for the price - some light aberrations looking at bright night objects (planets starts).
5,Binoculars exceeded my expectations. The view is clear and view range is broad coupled with strong magnification. It is not only good for star gazing it serves well used as field glasses. It is the best pair of binoculars I have owned for the money.  I would recommend it's purchase without hesitancy.
3,The binoculars are great except for one thing - the caps/covers do not stay on the lenses.  My husband has been wanting a good pair of binoculars for years.  I suprised him with these for Christmas.  He is not happy with the fact that the caps/covers are so loose fitting and do not stay on.
3,They had a flaw in the lens. Somebody left a smudge on the inside of one of the lens. Sent it back and Amazon only helped a little on the return shipping. Other than that they were fine and for the price they were great but I sent them back because it would have always had the smudge!
5,WowThese are awesome for spotting at around 300 yardsNot too strong to get fuzzy when you hold them in your hands eitherHave yet to look at the stars but once the weather breaks I expect they will impress me at that as well
5,Excelente se ven muy claro atraves de ellos buena calidad!!
5,Read other reviews claiming what a bargain these are and completely agree. Will be used mostly for sky viewing the tripod adaptor is essential as these binoculars are large and rather heavy making them hard to hold still on small objects. Very good visibility for the price.
5,I really like these Binoculars. They have a great lens in them for the price. Very well made and really not that heavy as some has advertised. I would recommendthem to anyone who loves to view the night sky but they work just as good in daylight as they do at night.
5,Excellent pair of binoculars although a bit large.  Great for distant observation especially for us mountain loving folks where you're looking across mountain ranges for wildlife etc.
4,definitely big boys these things are large. Good for the range but you gotta keep a steady hand or use the mounting bracket which I haven't done w/ a tripod yet.
5,I got these because we live near the ocean and there was alot going on out there that we couldn't see.  Now we can watch the ships in the distance with great clarity.  It is also great to see the shore birds closer in.  Great price and great binoculars.
4,it's a great product for the value! it's a bit heavy especially for my gf when we were on hiking trips so I ended up carrying it all the time. but I feel it's not bad at all!
4,This item is heavier than expected but works very well.
1,HiNot sure what planet you have to be on to think that these are good for night time start sighting...  That starts are a shaky mess that don't really look very much brighter than without them.  I tried a couple of planets (I think they were planets) and same thing.  The moon looked pretty good but not worth it.I have a pair of antique binoculars that I bought at a garage sale for $2 dollars that did a better job.I'm pretty sure they were broken but I could not really tell.  They were definitely not working right so I returned them.  Good return policy though got my refund back super quick!If you see my other feedback I don't often give bad feedback so it's not that I am one of those hard to please people.  Save your money
5,Great for boating
5,The local Lifelong Learning Institute recently hosted an Introduction to Astronomy course and recommended that for most amateurs a good set of binoculars was a better option than investing in an expensive telescope.  These are great and have finally given me a way to enjoy our rural night sky.
5,I was skeptical at first in purchasing these binoculars. But I tried them side by side with Simmons 10 X 50 binoculars and these are clearer and can see at a farther distance. (Since they are 15X). Very surprised on the optics. Can't compain. And the price is good too!.
4,really great value and great long range view. only things i didn't like were how big the binoculars are and it takes a minute to adjust your eyes to see through the lens.
5,This product was received in perfect conditions the quality is very good strong materials and great zoom
5,I bought these while thumbing through the Backyard Astronomer's Guide and I love them. They are a tiny bit weighty but what you are able to see with them is amazing. I bought these as an alternative to jumping right into buying a telescope and they fit the bill for this beginning astronomer perfectly.
5,Love these. Watching bison in Custer State Park; eagles working on their nests. Like I was there.
2,Received these in October of 2014 (owned 5 months). Basically used them a handful of times and then the right adjustable eyepiece just broke off. These were always kept in it's case and then in a padded bag within my closet when not in use. Never traveled with them either so road wear or misuse was not the cause of them breaking. I've found out that you have to pay Celestron $25.00 + any shipping charges for warranty repair on the binoculars. I think I'll just take the loss learn from my experience and invest my money somewhere else.
5,Great value for the price.  Pleiades and the Moon Jupiter and Saturn are all at your finger tips with these easy to hold binoculars.  Doubles as "night vision" with the light these 70 min binoculars pull in for you.  Very steady for hand holding and you won't be disappointed.
5,Can see a whole lot more with these than I expected.  I already had a good sturdy tripod and you will need that.  I also have a cheap flimsy tripod and I know it would never be still with these heavy binocs.  But Wow I have rediscovered the sky!
1,This review does not cover details about the quality of the binoculars but only the condition in which they were received. The binoculars were ordered as a new not used gift. They  had grease and hair on the outside and did not offer clear viewing because of dirt on the inside. Extremely disappointed that these heavily used binoculars would be repackaged and sold as new.
5,Powerful but it is a bit on the heavy side due to the lens. If you have this on a tripod then it's not an issue at all great item for the price. Keep this in my car at all time.
4,A sturdy instrument for spotting celestial objects.  The clear image they provide and their unexpectedly low weight makes these binoculars a fine accessory for any amateur or even as a first "telescope" for the beginner.  Excellent value for the money.
5,My husband has been looking for a way to see the stars and we gave our telescope to his parents (to watch boats). These do the trick nicely and are portable and comfortable in your hands. They work best if you lay on a blanket and hold your arms steady.
4,I did not consider how heavy these would be. I'm only 5'2" . However positioned on a tripod they are great. I am enjoying the constellations et al.
4,This was a gift for a 19 year old they like it.
4,These binoculars work great as long as you know what your doing  ie  focusing  They are a bit on the heavy side and recommend  getting a tripod
5,I admit it.  I have always cheaped out on binoculars.  These may actually be an extension of that but they are great!  I have a Celestron telescope that has served me well for 20 years but these are so much cooler.  Even a dope like me can use them
5,if you are beginner or pro this is the best binocular for stargazing  and deep sky for the stargazingChosen because I live in the city and this penetrates the light pollution and makes me watch the stars  reasonably good weight  can be mounted on  Tripod  and reasonable price.
5,Had to review this I take it on my hikes. The weight is a bit heavy for taking it on a daily hike especially mountain climbing. But they are totally worth it it sees decently far and they are very clear.
4,they work great for the price only wish that the strap came setup already (had to just tie it on because the little plastic clips feel very cheap)
4,Great binoculars but a little too heavy for my intended use.
5,Awesome binoculars. A little bigger than I thought but still cool! Perfect packaging and super fast shipping too! Thank you!
4,The binoculars are fantastic.  The site is clear and distance is good.  The weight can be an issue if you do not have a steady hand or holding it for a long streatch of time.  I would recomend the SkyMaster.
5,It arrived way beyond the expected time! I love it! Everything is well packaged and the product is just as described!
4,These are too powerful for my use.  I only need to see my bird feeders that are less than 20 feet from my window.  These were better for long distances.
5,These work very good.  I couldn't believe that I got binoculars of this quality for the low price. I purchased a second pair for my spouse so we can look at distant object together. These are very good for viewing the night sky too.
5,I ordered this for a friend for Christmas and tested it out before wrapping it and it was amazing.  Very easy to use and pretty light. My one suggestion would be to make sure to get a tripod.  It comes with a tripod adapter and this is useful because it's difficult to keep it steady.  But definitely a great purchase.
4,A little heavy that's why it comes with a tripod mount. View of the moon is great haven't had a clear night yet to lay on ground and view stars?
3,Good quality for a very good price. However because of the high power getting the alignment on the lenses (and images) for the right and left eyes is difficult. In my case I need to put the eyepieces so close together that they nearly sit onto the bridge of my nose.
4,Nice binocs for the price.  Clear relatively bright and good quality.  The workmanship isn't superb but for the price they're very nice.  Good usable binocs.
4,product is great value and quality is very good
1,I jumped at these when they were the deal of the day. I already own a smaller pair of Celestron binoculars as well as a Celestron telescope and various accessories and had no reason to doubt the quality of the brand name. However these binoculars have been nothing but a disappointment. I've tried three pair from Amazon and all have had defects. The focuser on the first pair didn't work although its optics seems superb. The second pair had some double vision and the left side was half blurry as if something wasn't assembled correctly. I received the third pair today and it has severe double vision. I've already boxed it up to return it to Amazon for a refund. Wherever these are manufactured quality control is obviously not a priority.
5,Husband loves anything Celestron - has one of their larger telescopes - so got these for him for Christmas.  He was over the moon so to speak!  Loves them; says he can see features on the moon never before possible with binoculars.  A real hit..
5,I just got these today from Amazon and just spent about an hour in the lawn looking at the sky! I was able to see all sorts of stuff not visible with the naked eye including some clusters a nice view of Saturn. I will probably be using these much more than my 6" Dobsonian!
5,I gave these to my daughter for Christmas. We will go outside at night and lay in the yard on a blanket and look up at the sky. She and I love to share this time together. The binoculars have made this time even more interesting. We get to explore lots of things we can't see with the naked eye.
4,Excellent. I use them for birdwatching and I was surprised that I could use them as well as I can my strong prescription for glasses
4,Heavy
5,If you dont have apair of these your really missing out on a great view of stars and planets. Great for bird watching and scenery .use them every day.
4,It is okay little too heavy but not try to look at the moon yet . Wait until next trip to Asia.
4,Christmas gift for my dad . He liked them but thought they were heavy . I had read the reviews and anticipated him needing a tripod . Nice wide view .
4,NICE  i bit big but works really great
5,These are great! If you want to look into astronomy but don't want to spend a ton of money this is a great buy! Easy to use not at all heavy really sharp clear optics and great value. I use these more than my 8" Reflector now. So much easier to grab and go outside. I am very happy with this purchase!
4,Optical rendition is good with only the slightest outside edges being fuzzy. These are big and a bit heavy. FOV is adaquate for observing wildlife and nature. Price is just right.
5,The binoculars seem to be well constructed. The optics are of good quality and are well collimated. The eyecups have three different positions and feel good when put to the eyes. The binoculars have a stable focus. All the parts were in the box with no surprises. A good optical instrument for little money. I'm satisfied thank you.
5,I did my homework read lots of info and reviews and selected this binocular for my husband who wanted a good quality but beginner set light weight so they're easy to hold for several minutes at a time low cost etc... He was very pleased...
5,Great.  Big beautiful views of the night sky moon across the bay.....and a great price too.  I've been doing astronomy for most of my life and have used a lot of equipment - very happy with these.
4,Great binoculars. Great price. Only one thing I was and still confused about is in the manual it shows some zoom lever and my binoculars don't have that.
4,Great value--true--the outer edges are a tiny bit blurred when compared to the center focus--but so what--move thebinocs over and bingo...Using as spotter scope for target practice---see standard target at 50 yds fine.
5,I CAN SEE INDIVIDUAL CRATERS ON THE FREAKIN MOON. You may want to buy a tripod as well though. Really hard to steady such awesome super power vision. Sturdy solid construction and protective bag comes with it with loops to hook it to a belt or whatever.
4,These are really fantastic. I was impressed most by how clear the view was. I gave four stars because they're heavy and difficult to hold still enough to see through for prolonged periods.
5,These binoculars are GREAT!  The people who rated them  on the this sight said they needed to be adjusted constantly.  Not true. They are crystal clear constantly true and their night vision is excellent!
5,Comically large a little difficult to hold by hand (you should already know this when you order ;) ) but dang they give a pretty awesome view.
5,they work as advertised.  BUT  be sure to get the model with the tripod attachment. yes they are big and get heavy after a while but I think a pretty good deal.  Had no trouble with a close-up of the 'red moon' this summer.....
4,I bought this as a gift for my brother a backyard skywatcher.  He's been using it despite the cold northeast weather on clear nights and reports it working well.
4,i gave it a 4 star because i gave it as a giftbut i tried it firstand it seemed fine don't know anymore about it thanks!!
5,Seriously love these binoculars. Yes they're a tad heavy and you need a decent tripod for them (make sure they not the cheap ones as these will break those) but overall I was able to see a lot more stars (I live in the Houston Area) and Jupiter shines brightly with these.
3,These binocs are super powerful but too heavy for a man to hold  for some quick viewing. My camer tripod is not equipped to hold this weight either so this item has seldom been used.  Would have given a 2-1/2 star if it were an option. Good quality otherwise.
3,I thought the 15x is zoom. But i came to know only after receiving the product that it doesn't have any zoom. The next models only have the zoom. I got disappointed.
4,Good but big and heavy
5,Excellent for viewing the moon but heavy-duty tripod makes it much more stable given the weight.
5,My husband absolutely loved these! A bit heavy for me though.
5,Wow effect  watched fireworks from a long distance.  Like you were right there.
5,Got these mainly for the eclipse and also for stargazing whenever I camp in the desert.  I have enjoyed using them!
4,Not bad high power Binoculars for the money...but definitely not much power for astronomy.
4,It is an excellent article I wish I could get one of greater scope with the same brand and a great price I like Celestron SkyMaster Giant 15x70 Binoculars.
5,these binoculars exceeded my expectations. They're more like a telescope they view so far. I am able to see the moon was super high clarity. The stand that is suggested for these binoculars is absolutely necessary as they are very heavy. Great deal.
5,Package arrived promptly - binoculars are collimated very well unlike some other reviews that I read. I did a lot or research on these before I purchased them and am very happy with them so far. Amazing the difference between your eyes only and the binoculars when viewing the sky. Highly recommend.
5,these are KA! i like them so much I went back and ordered the bigger one now i have one for me to stare at the stars and one for my girlfriend.
4,Good pair of binocs pretty heavy though so I can't hold them up for too long.  Since they're so heavy I wish they would have come with a strap.
5,We like this product alot and use it almost everyday.
3,My husband and I are always taking turns using my binoculars so I bought him his own for Christmas. These were a little more higher in the magnification than mine so thought that was a plus. However had I known they were so very heavy I would not have bought them.
5,Having shopped around the price was too good to pass on...$49.00 incl. free freight.  When the arrived they were everything promised in ad.  The tripod holder works perfect!  They are a large binocular that does require a steady hand to hold.  Product arrive within 3 days of ordering.  Very satisfied.
5,You can't go wrong for how clear these things bring in things.  Like many have said before...you get a lot of quality for 70 bucks.  From whale watching from the shoreline spotting animals on land  or star gazing at night....these things works wonderfully well.
5,Although a little heavy they do come with a tripod adapter which comes in handy after several minutes of sky gazing.  Gazing through these at the night sky I was able to view things I had never before seen.  The experience is quite amazing.
1,Its a shame- initially these were a great pair of binocs but after a year the plastic parts forward/behind the prism assemblies have become stick and slimy to the touch.  They have begun to dissolve to the point where the case and neck-straps have left impressions in the parts.  You cannot pick up or use the binocs without your hands getting sticky goo on them.  The eye-cusions and end-caps are fine. I'd consider buying another pair if Celestron could assure me the manufacturing defect has been corrected- but how can one know???
5,I gave these as a gift and the only thing I heard from the recipient was WOW!  I am pretty certain that he will be able to see clusters of stars and bears in the woods.  Just a great reasonably priced all-around Giant set of Binoculars.
2,The tripod attachment is flimsy and will shake for close to 30 seconds if not longer. The item itself had some debris on the inside of the left upper side lens. It's been cloudy in my area so I am waiting to try it out to decide whether it will be returned or exchanged.
5,Can't beat for the price! I've seen bad reviews for these but as a novice when it comes to optics these things rock for the money I spent. My son and I love looking at the moon and his with these things. Great price and fat delivery.
5,On a clear night in the city I live in I was actually able to see the dust of Orion's Nebula! And they're small enough to take almost anywhere--I just kept them in my car while I still have it. You definitely need a tripod but these are fantastic.
5,Beyond awesome. Very steady. Only down side is the size but hey you get to see things properly :-) Also I have issue will all binocualrs due to the sizing of my eyes I think but these were perfect.
5,Really it's a pretty great deal. They are excellent astronomy binoculars for a great price. Bought it as a Christmas gift for my college daughter and she loves them. Her first night using them she saw the Orion Nebula and was in awe.
2,This isn't the pair of binoculars you want for star gazing. Yes the optics are great considering the price but they are so cheaply constructed that the smallest bump will knock them out of collimation. They arrived in perfect condition but after a couple of months they started giving double images when star gazing (and yes I know how to adjust them).I can't really recommed these because I have a pair of 10x50's that are the same price a lot more compact lighter and they give way better views.Except for a spotting scope everything else I bought from Celestron has been substandard.
5,Awesome astronomy binoculars. I can look at the night sky for hours. You can even see the craters on the moon with these babies. A little heavy but I just prop my arms up somewhere when I can. The moon is absolutely breathtaking!
5,It is insane how well these work especially when they don't cost an arm and a leg.  If you are considering these and are on the fence go ahead and buy them.  You don't regret it!
5,We have had a great time looking at all the ridges and mountains on the moon and clearly seeing the blinking lights on the orbiting satallites. You do have to brace against a wall so I am looking at tripod mounts but I love these binoculars
3,Pretty nice and a good deal too.  But it is rather heavy and you should be aware.  It is very difficult to hold it up long.  I wish I bought one with smaller and lighter weight.  I don't think magnification will make much difference anyway.
5,Was a bit shy about these based on the negative reviews but I bought them anyway due to the price.  They are very nice.  No double imaging very clear focus and a joy right out of the box.  Extremely happy with the purchase.
5,If you want to see the Jovian moons the red Planet double stars and exquisite detail of the Moon as well as spy on people far away this is the aisle seat in economy.
5,Buy it. Great for night viewing. Was looking for new telescope. Now not for sure. I have a pentax 8X40 for daytime viewing which has way better optics. But for night and 150.00 dollars cheaper you can't go wrong. Lens covers suck (fall off ) but these are worth the price.
5,we love these!!! I'm so happy with this purchase. great for star gazing on the deck. we live in a rural area so these are perfect with a dak sky. Supervised kids love them too.
5,Using these for astronomy primarily.  Work very good for this price! Handholding is a bit shaky but thats expected for 15x. A good tripod is needed to hold them steady. Most cheaper tripods aren't enough especially if you have to crank up the height. But this is expected considering these are 15x70's!  These are not opera glasses!  :-)
5,These aren't as strong as I hoped and they don't zoom but they are still excellent binoculars for my astronomy class.
3,Good eye relief even with glasses but I found nicer viewing without my glasses. Focus range large enough for both.Mounting on a tripod may distort the focus mechanism. I could not bring back from max focus travel while on tripod or off.Amazon sent replacement quickly. It is fine. I will just use hand held.
4,Powerful zoom reasonable price! You'll have to get a more solid carrying case in case of travel. Lids are a bit flimsy but will do.
3,The binoculars are actually fantastic however the box itself said the tripod adapter was included but it was nowhere to be found.Felt cheated and now i need to buy the adapter.
5,I already got this pair of binoculars for an early Christmas present and I love it.  As a reborn amateur astronomer these binoculars are easy to use and yield satisfying results.  I recommend pairing it with a tripod however to stabilize the images.  Good buy!
4,really like these. good for day and night. but you really need a tripod for night use. otherwise it's too shaky.
5,the product is everything and expected and more. can look at the moon in the night and see the craters.haven't gotten a chance to use in the day but with the type of magnification to see the moon i can imagine it during the day.
5,What a great price for an intro into sky watching.  I think everyone should have a pair of these and then take the time to gaze at the stars at night for some nice relaxation.  Great clear optics.  they are a little heavy. simple to operate.
4,This is an excellent product but I bout it for 69 USD however now the price is only $53.13 within a month.This is not fair to charge extra just because I bought early
5,Got these a year ago and love them! Sharp optics make the moon look so clear. I would not recommend hand holding these and I am grateful they came with a tripod adapter. I just mount them to an old camera tripod and out the backyard for so star gazing.
5,Excellent deal
5,These were a replacement for some less powerful computer-linked binoculars that were a Christmas gift.  These binoculars were twice the price (but still a GREAT deal) and 100x more fun to use!  They are clear and powerful.  A bit heavy but can easily be used with a tripod for stability.
5,Just oh my god  I had a telescope (celestron as well) that is fine once you get it aimed but these binoculars are amazing for scanning the sky.  Use the included tripod adapter for kids though as they're fairly heavy.
5,These things blew me away. For around $50 I didn't expect much and they were MUCH better than we expected. Used them to see the moons on Jupiter...seriously.A tripod is useful but not required.. Do need a steady hand.We're going to buy a pair as a gift.
5,These are a great deal for the price. They seem durable and the view is nice and clear. I bought them for camping hiking bird watching etc... I just wanted something that I could throw in my truck and didn't mind beating up and getting dirty. Definitely worth the money.
4,These were a big hit with my astronomy buff daughter.  A good quality product. They're big but portable enough for casual stargazing without a lot of hassle.
1,I was attracted to these binoculars by the number of encouraging reviews and by the low price. I should know by now that you get what you pay for. I took them outside the first night for a look at the moons of Jupiter expecting a spectacular view and got a double image of Jupiter that I could not resolve no matter how much focusing and rotating of the binoculars I did.Very disappointing after so much expectation.I thought Celestron would have had better quality control on products they put their name on. Amazon is tops though because the took them back with not a problem. My standard binoculars are Canon 10x30 image stabilized that give a very clear view. The moons of Jupiter are easily resolved. Stick with quality optics.  Canon 10x30 Image Stabilization Binoculars w/Case Neck Strap & Batteries
4,I am well satisfied with this Binoculars. I see things clearly with it. I am even happy when looking at the night sky
3,the weight was the dislike. purchased to see owls in the woods better.
4,A little expensive and somewhat heavy.  works well when on a tripod  would recommend this item for easy viewing and nice case for storing
5,South African Safari !
5,Totally happy with my purchase
5,I love these binoculars.  I actually use them more than my telescope.  Its perspective changing how many stars you can see.  These are a must have!
5,I just used these last night to view the lunar eclipse and everything was really clear. It's easy to use and comes with a tripod adapter and storage case it's perfect for beginners to get them started before making a bigger investment on a nicer telescope.
2,Out of collimation messed with it quite a bit after reading many how-to's online. I've gotten it better but can't get it right. It's ok for viewing stuff far away during the day. Stars and the moon have red on one side blue on the other not super sharp. Just cheap chinese crap as expected. I use them with one eye only even after probably 20 hours of messing with collimation and alignment over the years (due to technical interest and the challenge obviously not worth the time compared with just buying better ones which is the only solution to these).
5,I was looking for a binocular for a Christmas gift After reading the reviews and the price. I just give a shotIt was better than expected great quality vivid  color  nice for terrestial and astronomy i have tested in jupiter and orion nebula they look great
3,when i opened the box i was surprised . I thought it is not my package because it is too big .but it is efficient with great zoom .sometimes there is difficulties in image stabilization but still amazing regarding it's pricedo more  spend lessthanks
5,Great pair of binoculars for stargazing - it performs as expected. The included tripod adapter is all plastic and so wobbles slightly when used in windy conditions.
5,Pretty nice. For stargazing when I have the chance. Has a nice view. Not much more to say.
5,For this price 1/10th of all others in this category is great.I purchased specifically for the Oregon coast and where I live on the high desert.The night sky here is incredible but spotting sky objects with these binoculars is incredible.Used a similar pair in the NavyYou cannot go wrong with the price !!
3,It's actually not quite what I expected....it's a well made productdon't misunderstand me..and the shipper was very prompt...I guess I just didn't realize the weight versus the area of coverage 'till I actually had them.....but they were great and took them back with absolutely no squabble......very good shipper.
4,They are a good binocular for the price cannot go wrong. I bought two pair returned one for a refund (which was handled very well).
5,i love it however it is very heavy and without a tripod it will wear you down pretty quick.
4,Good images but a little on the weighty side for off hand viewing. Defiantly need a tripod. Good buy.
5,Amateur star gazer. Its nice to take on trips keep in the car. Some nights I don't want to set up the bigger scope. The mag is right. Any more and you'd have to always use the tripod. Its nice to help spot as well.
3,These are great! Amazing what you can see. I expected them to not be as sharp as they are. Haven't tried them on a tripod yet but I bet it will be awesome!
5,Use them often to look at critters in the fields... Work better with a tripod to stabilize them. Did return the first pair due to one side being blurry but the second pair sent work great. They are not perfectly clear but they are also not <$2000
4,Difficult to see one image and you lose depth perception but for the price its excellent for astroviewing. Not so good for much else.
5,Sturdy feels high quality with excellent optics and magnification. Easily adjustable and accommodating for most faces and visual acuity I would think.
5,Binoculares de excelente calidad para uso en astronomÃ­a recomendable uso de trÃ­pode.
5,I like these binoculars and was impressed with the quality for the price. The magnification was good. I would have to agree with others about using a tripod to view with these. They are heavy and a bit cumbersome but great quality for the price.
1,First pair arrived with an internal light baffle loose and bouncing around in one tube.  Exchange through Amazon was easy but the second pair was way out of collimation - pronounced double vision when looking at point sources like stars.  I collimated them (at the cost of having to cut away part of the rubber grip over a collimation screw) but then the left side would not come to focus.I have a Celestron Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope from the late 70s that's a fine optical instrument but I won't be buying anything more from Celestron after this experience.
3,It was more than I expected size that is.  It was not much of an improvement over the old set I've had since 1966. For the price I paid I'm O.K.with it...
3,These binoculars were out of collimation and the left ocular prism was mounted in such a way that it obstructed the left ocular lens view in the upper left hand corner.  For the price of $48.00 I should have not expected too much in the way of quality.
4,Have not used it due to lot of fog where I live.  I plan to use it for observing the Moon and tracking the constellations.
5,Great views however too heavy to hold and could not see stars as well as I wanted probably great for bird-watching.
5,Looking for Binoculars for star gazing. Problem that most were simply too expensive.These were both inexpensive and had good reviews.Purchased them.Able to clearly see the moons of Jupiter the nebula with Orion's belt and the Andromeda galaxy.Have used them for boating as well.
4,Good binos.  I bought them for target shooting.  I needed to see up close 100-150 yards out.  They work good.
4,Great pair of binoculars for the price.
5,I'm no expert so I depended on the reviews of others here in Amazon and was not disappointed. Thanks all for taking the time to review this product. These binoculars have been great for birding and even peering at the moon and nearby planets (and it even picks out their moons!). The tri-pod adapter is a great bonus.
5,No issues with the optics! Awesome!But the included tripod adapter ( which a binocular this powerful demands) is useless not rigid enough at all.Made my own from a bent bracket bar...you will need to as wellas the power of the optics negates being effectively handheld
4,They appear to have reasonable optics for an inexpensive binocular but frankly haven't had much of a chance to use them yet.
5,Just use these on my balcony checking out the mountains lights of the city etc. Work great and look great. Certainly recommend this product. These binoculars have a substantial look and feel in your hands. Great product at a great price.
5,As a sailor was accustoned to 7 by 50s....but for home use these binoculars are great for peering at the moon or bird watching.
5,Yes a little hard to hold by hand but the magnification is nice. Feels like you are using binoculars rather than the lower power ones.
3,These are very nice binoculars but difficult to use without a tripod or other form of stabilization.  If you don't have a tripod propping your elbows against a solid surface while using them helps.  However they're not a great choice for free viewing because of their length and weight.
5,Yes they are a bit large for smaller hands but they are excellent at doing what they described. Having had a few different sized binoculars and telescopes over the years to compare to these are definitely a nice addition.
5,Great prize and easy to use a little heavy but I am so happy that i bought them Its a great product to start getting to know what is  up in the sky. I was amazed when i first saw the moon with this binoculars.
4,Am satisfied for the performance of these binoculars. Only thing it is a little heavy and big but other than that its quite good
5,I got these for an Eagle watching tour and they were great at that relatively close range.  When mounted on my tripod they are strong enough to view several of the moons of Jupiter.  Awesome quality for the price.
4,Good Quality but a little heavy.
4,Great lenses even in low light situations. The magnification is awesome! Great for hunting if you don't mind the bulkiness & weight. Great price!
5,These are super! Our grandkids love to get them out put them on the tripod and search the skies at night.  We also use them during the day to watch the hawks in our pasture.
5,Es como yo querÃ­a estoy feliz (:
5,Now we are connected! All Works beautifully. The Celestron is very sharp now and no weird strange abrasion on the lens or the eye piece....I'll watch the Comet this evening and thank you again Roberta and the good lad from down under.  Good job All.Fred smoot
5,I can see clearly now!(well as long as I have a tripod or a benchrest to hold these heavy suckers up for me)
5,I purchased these binoculars for my husband to look at the stars.  The moon is fantastic.  A solid support is definitely necessary as the slightest movement of the binoculars results in extreme jerking of items in view.  However given the type of binoculars that characteristic is not unexpected.
2,Package came in good condition and the binoculars looked fine.  The tripod adapter is almost useless as it wobbles with the slightest touch producing a shaking that is about as bad as holding it by hand.  But the most serious problem was collimation the misalignment of the two sets of optics making it impossible to anything to be seen as one image.  Also there was obvious chromatic abberation which created some yellowish fringes around images.  Optics were pretty sharp and if collimation was not present I would have kept them.  Sent them back.
5,I really like these and especially for kids.  I'm a bit shaky so the tripod adapter comes in handy.  Even better when you use an app for the night sky.  Lots of fun and worth the price to look at the moon alone.
5,Bought two pair for daughter and self.  Heavy but worth the weight.  Also purchased two tripods which are very useful.  These Binocs are great for daytime use but also for star gazing.  In my view well worth the cost..
2,I thought I could get into astronomy but I was wrong. These binoculars definitely didnt help because they frustrated me constantly. The adjustment knob kept moving and more importantly it's heavy as hell. definitely not something i would want hanging around my neck. It seems pretty great when it actually does work but the cons have drawn away my interest. The bino's have been sitting in my closet since December and that's probably where they'll stay until i get married have kids they have kids who come to visit and go through my old things.
5,I am a astronemer and my telescope worked but with this product it s awesome i could see the moons of Jupitor north star moon M31 m32 m33 saturn and more.My favoite looking abject is Venus and saturn REALY UP CLOSE it was like i was in space.
5,These are telescopes in the form of binoculars! They're heavy but have a tripod adapter included for use at the range or for stargazing. Amazingly powerful!
5,Amazing! My husband love stargazing but doesn't like to pull out our big telescope all the time this has been perfect for him. I would definitely reccomend a good tripod with this to get the clearist view.
3,A decent long distance viewing binocular at a great price. The brightness and clarity for a $60 pair of binoculars is satisfactory. These are a little heavier than you'd like but I have no problem with using them for short viewing. But I'm glad I did buy a tripod for extended/sky viewing.
4,Then the mountains experimenting with a spring-season time I will share my ideas here!
4,Pretty heavy as expected.  Opted for a monopod.  Much better then.
5,Great binoculars for the price. Could see Jupiter's moons and Saturn's rings and Orion nebula by mounting it on a tripod.
4,Very satisfied with the product.  A bit heavy to see far unless mounted on Tripod.  Couldn't figure out how to attach to Tripod.
5,I love my Celestron SkyMaster Giant 15x70 Binoculars. It's a 1st rate product and  I am looking forward to using it for many many years to come viewing the sky. Amazon did a very good job in processing the order which arrived earlier than the scheduled date.
5,These really are great.  They work better than expected.  The lenses really provide for such crystal clear and sharp viewing.  Highly recommended.
5,We love stargazing with this item.  Not as powerful as a telescope but portable
2,The good:For daytime use the binoculars were ok.The bad:For nighttime when you want pinpoint stars they are bad. I couldn't get them to go beyond an horrible sparkly triangle.The ugly:How Celestron decided it was ok to ship the binos with that tripod adapter is beyond me. It is a cheap plastic piece that does nothing to stabilize the binos.
4,they came just in time to watch meteor showers last month easier than dragging telescope out
4,Excellent opics. The tripod adapter is so flimsy as to be  nearly useless.
4,Very Nice Can see some of jupiters moons Pleiades orion nebula. Only bad thing about these are the tripod adapter sucks!
5,Works great for star and moon gazing. I am happy with this purchase and price. I do lean against something to stabilize and plan on mounting on a tripod. Moon viewing is very cool!
5,For the price as 15x70 it beats everybody else Great quality firm but a little heavy.I doubted it's 15x70 but It did its job Great if you love to stare at the moon or trips to the mountains.The adapter is useful.
5,Excelente lo recomiendo para salir a observar la naturaleza
5,I liked it a lot even though it was a little too big great though!
4,Very good binocular for the price.  Tripod adapter is made of plastic which makes the binocular wobble on any tripod.
5,High quality astronomy binocs. Very clear picture and good magnification to look at not just Moon but constellations galaxies etc. Well worth the price!
5,If you want to see something close up then buy these binoculars ! Yes they are big but easy to use and provide a great view! Whether at the races bird watching or searching for the stars these binocular's will get the job done!
5,Tonight was the first clear night since receiving the binoculars. I was amazed at how sharp and beautiful the sky looked. I saw the Orion Nebula for the first time which was absolutely gorgeous. I could not be more satisfied given the ridiculously cheap price I paid.
5,I bought these for my brother and he just loves them!
5,The binoculars are great but they were delivered w/out the tripod adapter which I was eventually able to have directly delivered by Celestron. If you do not already have a decent tripod I would highly recommend the purchase of one[Vista Explorer] w/ the binoculars.
5,I recently ordered this product and was totally satisfied with all aspects of ordering shipment and product quality. The tripod adapter is easy to use and the binoculars are balanced well when attached to the tripod. It's intended use is for near field celestial viewing. It has already been put to use and has proven to be an excellent choice.
5,I have bought four of these and at least two of my friends have used mine and bought one for themselves.  These are great for everyday use or for looking at the night sky.  I am impressed with the optics for this price.
5,These binoculars are great! Lightweight and it has great focus. I would buy this again!
5,I can clearly see the craters on the moon.  I live in the city and can visibly see only about three stars with my naked eye but the binoculars help me to see dozens of stars!
4,great power and good adjustments for focus mom likes better zoom than smaller binocs.
5,I purchased the Celestron SkyMaster Giant 15x70 Binoculars for my 21 year old daughter who recently took an astronomy class.  She is thoroughly pleased with the product and regularly goes out and views the stars.  She said they rated very close to the types of viewing equipment they used in her college class.
5,feels great in the hands and i could see from so far away i was surprised worth getting and price was reasonable. must get if you don't want to spend much but want something that zooms in a lot then this is great for you
5,Fantastic binoculars.  Love to watch full moon with them and all other spectacular events.  Highly recommended
5,the astronomical viewing for this binocular is just as detailed as my 5 inch aperture telescope. for the price this is a steal! i've seen more DSO's on this binocular than on my telescope. i plan to make this binocular as "push-to" by attaching a celestron skyscout on top with a good sturdy tripod.clear skies!
5,I really can't add much except to confirm these are heavy surprisingly sharp and pleasantly inexpensive.  I use them to scan the night sky looking at planets and the brighter DSOs but they work pretty well on birding walks too!
2,They were not nearly as good as I had hoped but for the price what do you expect? They were 2 out of 5 stars. For perfection they would be about 700 - 1000 bucks so keep that in mind when you pick these. They lack clarity due to low quality optics due to low budget. Good lenses are costly these are cheap You get what you pay for
5,These are nice Binoculars Look forward to setting these up on a tripod to check out the moon and stars this summer.work great for watching wildlife as well.
4,Nice for looking at the moon...my kids love it
4,it was ok ...but th glass doesn't look its going to last for long...jst hve to wait n see
4,Great for stars birds and as a spotting scope. Only wish the zoom could be adjusted. Also a but heavy
5,The view from these is amazing. I'm an armature astronomer and i used these to look at the moon. the detail was just as amazing as my telescope. These are also way bigger then i expected. seriously these are huge. only complaint is they are kinda heavy but that is expected.
5,Got these for for $46 a month or so ago. I just moved to the beach and use them for watching the ships and planes go by. Incredible even my wife enjoys them! Haven't tried using them for astronomy yet but looking forward ot it.
4,Good quality and cheap!
5,It doesnât focus at all
4,Decent
3,Really need a tripod to use these.  Only way they are semi stable is laying on your back.  Maybe a lower magnification would have proved beneficial.  These are a bit overkill
5,I liked everything about the Celestron Skymaster Binoculars but the weight.  They are heavy but they areof good quality. I rate it as a good product.
4,These are pretty big I find I need to rest them on something if I want to gaze for awhile.
4,They work very well. I had no issues with them at all. The Optics are far better than I expected for the price
5,These are really great binoculars for the price. We were able to see the radio tower on the mountain by our home which is quite far away. You definitely need a tripod for distance though. At high magnification things wobble quite a bit.
4,Get a tripod if you want to see anything small clearly... That or I drink too much caffeine.
5,The binoculars themselves are great for astronomy and are available at an extremely good price. They have allowed me to look at so many objects in the night sky. The binoculars are especially nice if you are new to astronomy because they will easily introduce you to the best that the night sky offers.
4,I wanted a powerful set of binoculars this is just what I needed great for viewing landscapes or birds would recommend them
4,I LIKE THESE GLASSES  I USE THEM TO WATCH WILD LIFE AND I WILL TAKE THEM ON OUR CRUISE IN AUGUST.
4,great for the price can see lots of stars at night that are not visible to the naked eye.
5,we can count the craters on the moon!  needs a tripod or I can lean it on the fence or car hood or against the van to keep it still enough to look at birds or planets or the moon
5,Great value for the price. Well made & adjusts nicely. Would highly recommend getting a tripod as these are quite heavy for continued use (tripod adaptor mount is included).  Saw rings of Saturn for first time.Still looking for the Millenium Falcon though..
4,pretty good price and fast shipping and pretty easy to use I do recommend it for ease of use and quality thanks
5,An excellent binocular. I use it for seeing the sky andbirds. However just make sure you use a tripod with this binocularor it will vibrate heavily!
5,Stunned at the quality of these binoculars.  Very inexpensive and you can really see well into the dark skies.  Strongly encourage buying the stand along with this piece (it comes with the adjuster knob)
4,Very clear and easy to use binoculars. I haven't been able to use them much yet believe they will do just fine.
5,We are on the river and use them to view the freighter traffic and Canadian shore -Great everyone at the bar use them and are amazed!
5,These binoculars are spectacular! Stars like you've never seen before and magnification you wouldn't believe! Definite must have for any stargazer or aspiring astronomer.
5,So clear!!! I don't think this is too heavy perhaps because I work out. It does shake a lot though so I need to get a tripod.I do recommend this! this thing looks like it is worth over $100.
5,Simply awesome and at an unbelievable price!!! Get the tripod by this company.
4,Good for occasionally night watching.Very good build quality.But a bit too heavy for extended use without a tripod.
4,works great but get the tripod to steady when using
4,A little heavy but overall a very nice pair of well made binos.
2,I'm leaving tomorrow on a three day schooner trip and I thought these would be a great addition.  Out of the box they are handsome and the optics look well coated and clear.  I smiled at the heft 'cause they have a good manly look and feel.  However the collimation is so poor that I can't merge the two images.  Perfect if you are blind in one eye or wish to use at the same time with a friend but unusable in the typical fashion.
4,I love these binoculars!
5,I would recommend these binoculars to anyone who enjoys searching the sky at night!!  Works great!  I recommend them for nighttime sky viewing.  I'm certain they are WONDERFUL during the day also - I just haven't used them for that yet.
4,Everything that the discription said about the binoculars was correct. I use the binoculars daily now to watch the birds.
5,bought this for my beach house to watch the boats and marine life from atop my house on the hill.works great at night to watch the moon and constellations you must use a tripod heavy and shakes a lot
4,I  first purchased  20X80s.  This was  overkill;  too much  detail. For a beginner  15x70 is  easier  to use.
5,These are heavy best used on a tripod or monopod but these can't be beat for the price
5,These binoculars are great and for a price that can't be beat. Can't wait to use these in the field from the clear veiwing I did around the neighborhood this weekend thes will be great for hunting.
4,Surprisingly good binoculars I was very happy with the purchase
4,Nice binocs for both astronomical skygazing and checking out birds in the yard.
5,These are huge definitely not a walk-around town thing. But sitting on a balcony next to an airport put them on a tripod and they're magic. Especially for the money.
4,good viewing not great little more weight then a standard one and awkward but best for a tripod?
5,Bought these as a gift for my father who lives on the beach and he loves them because you can look at things far and near and not have to adjust the focus. Easy to use even for an old man!
4,heavy but good
5,Fantastic binoculars!  Love looking at the moon up close the horizons & mountains.  Wildlife & nature right up close.
5,These are really probably the best binocs you can get for the price. I threw mine on a tripod and use them for star watching and they are incredible. For other reasons (hiking hunting birdwatching neighbor-watching) they might be a little on the large side but they really are powerful.
5,Man I just thought that these were regular binoculars but boy this will bring everything up close close close!  I bought it to watch football games now I know I will SEE everything!
5,The description of these say that there is a tripod mount adapter.  Well they must have forgot to include in my package.  Did not plan on using the tripod mount but if it does not exist they should correct their description.
1,This is so long over due for a review. I kind of wondered why I got such a good deal on these. I bought them for my dad as a birthday gift. He couldn't get the to focus correctly. I figured well dads getting older I'll just get him something else so my husband said he'd keep them. Well a few months went by we were busy. He's very smart and tech savvy and such. He got them out read the instructions did everything he was suppose to and its a defective product. Too late to do anything about. Can't get a refund but can warn people about this seller. So I'm out about $80 with a piece of crap defective product that I can't do anything about.
5,These things work well and for the price they are worth having. They provide a clear picture.  Remember the greater the magnification the easier it is for things to shake.  You might have to use the tripod mount accessory.
4,Could see clearly on person action even at1km away. Good clarity at night as well. Good for long range surveillance.
5,Love these Binoculars especially with the Tripod adapter since they're so big.  This is the first pair of binoculars I've used and they are excellent.  Great for night viewing as well but we are using them for bird watching.
4,Great to look at the nightime sky. Have been great for stargazing and would reccomend to everybodyespecially the 1st time astronomers.
5,I use them for the lake and football games. They are a excellent value a little long but they are manageable without the use of a tripod. Wish I had bought these sooner
5,They do what they're advertised to do lighter than I thought after reading all the reviews and yes you are gonna need a tripod if you wanna see celestial bodies I like em all around great binoculars.
5,I'm new to star gazing and tried them for the first time last night. WOW! what you can see with these are amazing. I can't wait to use them again.
5,I got these for my husband for Christmas and he LOVES them. We haven't used them on a hike yet but we've stargazed with them and it's awesome. We can see lots of details on the moon!
5,I was surprised that I was able to hold these binoculars still enough to be able to view celestial objects. On the first night I saw Venus in crescent shape looking like a smile and three moons of Jupiter. Awesome!
4,Very nice for the prize.and good range.
5,These binoculars are great....and so comically huge they are a sure to start a conversation. I got them to look across the bay at boats and they do a fantastic job. For the price these can't be beat!
5,I gave this to my parents who are novices and they LOVE IT!  They plan on taking it on vacation and I borrow it when I don't want to lug a telescope.  Great buy could not be happier!
3,this binacolar is very nice but is to heavy to keep steady i purchased a tripod but the part the problem is with the part that came wit binacolars to tripod is bad it vibrate even on tripod if you touch it
3,These binoculars are good for stargazing would have given 4-5 star if it wasn't that heavy. I would definitely recommend a smaller binocular for beginners maybe 10X50. If you are going to use these I would recommend buying a heavy duty tripod.
4,very good product very good vision minor power than I expect but however I'm very glad whit my third Binoculars.
4,Very powerful but the fabric case included offers little protection otherwise it was a good buy.
2,I have now bought two pairs of these binoculars. Both have come in slightly out of alignment giving a doubled image.  I dont blame the binoculars but rather inadequate packaging in shipping.  Using them as a monocular while not what I wanted they optically are fine. I wish I had a decent pair that worked properly.
4,I like them.  they were collimated well enough and are great for both astronomy and birding.
5,Very Strong and not too jumpy!  Good brightness and eye relief.
5,This is a very nice binocular. You can hold it with your hand when using it at the daytime. And you'd better using the tripod when you want to stargazing at night. It is easy to see the four moons of Jupiter by this binocular. Very sharp and bright!!
5,OMG if I could now get my husband inside at night. WOW at the things you can see more clear then in a regular binocular. I have to admit I keep going outside with them as well
4,For the price they are good.  The image is fairly clear; the moon looks great.
5,This pair of binoculars is simply fantastic! Their adjust abilities are great and extremely easy to use. Besides being a little bit on the bulky side I would definitely recommend this item to hunters nature watchers and (I have no idea what their official name is sorry) star gazers.
5,Excellent binoculars which really bring objects in close. The price is great and these binoculars are valued up top with the high grade expensive ones. You really get more than what you are paying for with these. I recommend these to everyone.
5,I have been using spotting scopes and various small cheap binoculars for bird-watching etc.  These Celestron binoculars are a vast improvement.  I am sure I will never feel the need to purchase any more expensive binos
4,Meet my expectations
5,Great Binoculars.Needs Tripod thought it is extremely hard to keep a steady hand while holding this for more than 5 seconds.
4,Great product except the weight.
2,Returned. Huge collimation issues. I bought it for beginner's stargazing but real hard with a product like this that comes out of the box all messed up. Furthermore mine didn't come with manual and plastic wraps so I couldn't help but wonder I received a previously returned item.
4,Haven't had a chance to use them much but it was a good not-too-expensive option.
3,Did not find them to be great for sky viewing as some had suggested.  I only found them good for close-ups of the moon. I really need a telescope.
4,very good glasses and lots of fun
4,For the price it is a 5
5,I have not had a chance to use them yet but it will be a lot easier to use then hauling out my telescope. I also will use it when I go fishing to view wildlife from my boat.
2,1. I can not see clearly with two eyes in the same time....i play a lot with the focus and the opstacle zoom...without sucess.2. I can get out One of the obstacle ...it seem like it was broken and it is not new.
5,Picture quality is great!
4,I could see the moon pretty clearly!
5,These are great!! I had a smaller pair from a different vendor that that didn't have as much magnification but these have it.Crisp clear images and great for day and night viewing. Recommended!!
4,Slight lack of clarity in the peripheral areas of the viewing. Over-all adequate for moon-gazing.
4,Could Zoom in closer
2,I used the product for 2 months and the lenses literally fell into the binocular itself. Iâve only had them since February and they already faulted.
5,This is wicked. High end view with a very good price. Just buy it!
5,These binoculars are great I got them for my soon-to-be Father-in-Law. He loves them and uses them quite frequently they allow him to view a quality image from quite some distance. They are surprisingly light in weight for their size and with an optional tripod they allow hours of enjoyment.
4,great for the money
5,Love the binoculars but will need to buy a tripod for it.  It's even better than my telescope that I got for Christmas a couple of years ago.
3,a bit to heavy for my taste and for the money its not very helpful for star gazing especially with chemtrails covering the sky
4,ok but heavy
5,Awesome Binoc's. Powerful! Great for when I don't feel like breaking out my telescope. Helps me get a very detailed glimpse of the moon or planes flying high overhead. Great investment for a great price
4,Good quality for occasional use. If you view the night sky a lot upgrade.
4,Lot's of fun to use and explore sights you can't see without them.
1,A couple of things that failed to meet my expectations and which led me to suspect either a poor workmanship or a fake product -1) eye piece dropped off immediately when first tried... appears to be glued together by a cheap adhesive that was still liquid;2) ability to zoom in n  a function that is basic requirement for any binoculars out is non-existent;All in all I am truly amazed by this Amazon experience. Exchange process being so complex and drawn out for overseas customers like me  I decided to skip the attempt n chalk it down to my fault for being swindled...
3,Not nearly as clear (clarity of glass) as some other reviews they are cool to use. I did not find them as weighty as some others.
2,Can't use without a tripod.
5,Can't say enough good about  these binoculars they are fantastic. Arrived quickly and of course it was cloudy had to wait for a week for it to clear up and the the views of the Milky Wat were astounding!
5,This unit is awesome clear sharp images and easy to use and pull out on short notice. Can see Orion nebula andromeda galaxy Jupiter and moons easily even while holding unit with hands with tripod even better. Recommended as a must have for sky watching.
5,I use it to look beyond and to see the stars better at night hoping to see something else which I have already excited to go to the mountains at night and stargaze at the sky.high quality product thanks
5,Celestron SkyMaster Giant 15x70 Binoculars were purchased for my grandson.  He loves watching the stars.  He loves this.
5,ExcellentEverything and more that was said was trueMy husband Loves them.They fit on our camera tripod and he's viewing the Sound.
3,I expected more for the size and magnification. Price is good for the value but my item was not properly collimated.  I sent item back.
4,Little heavy but work great.
3,1-Too heavy.2-The image is not crystal clear.3-The image vibrates badly when you watch the moon or a star.4-The magnifying power is not what is claimed.I think  cheap light weight and ordinary binoculars might do almost the same job.
1,It's actually mind boggling that the collimation problems go back to 2007 in these reviews and they still come out of the factory with this problem in huge numbers. Mine has collimation problems (double vision) so now I have to decide whether I go through the hassle of an exchange or if I just keep them and try and fix it myself.  It's best to teach the company a lesson and do an exchange instead of potentially breaking them yourself.Update:Just received my 2nd pair.  Jupiter is double vision again.  Even worse than the first pair.  What a surprise.
3,Very heavy and I guess it was designed to be used only with a tripod in mind. Bought this to explore some things around the neighborhood ;L) and it serves well. Great for the price! get it only on a sale
3,these were decently priced and are so much better for viewing than my previous binoculars but they are quite heavy which results in too much hand shaking and trouble maintaining the view. i guess i'll have to use them with a tripod.
5,Remarkable clarity and magnification. They are a bit hefty to hold so you might want to think about mounting on a tripod. With the magnification any slight hand movement or tremor will be amplified. Remarkable price for a high grade optic!
5,I got the first one and sent back; wasn't in calibration. Got second one quickly.  Now can see Jupiter and moons and Mars and moons. Terrestrial objects so close that if they move you'll jump back.
4,Good product.  Exactly as described.  Anymore powerful and you would need a tripod.  Enjoy the better view of the moon.
3,Too large according to my husband but is able to use for what we bought it for. I wish I would have gotten a smaller but stronger one.
5,Great for viewing.
4,This is a sturdy reliable pair of binoculars and more than worth the price.
3,No Zoom Lever? There is Zoom Lever in manual book but not on the Binocular.How can I see near and far away objects.
5,I usually have trouble viewing through these types of viewers. I can see really well and the the views are very clear. Used as regular binoculars or celestial viewing. Works really well for either or both.
5,I am very pleased with the quality and performance of these binoculars.  Construction is solid.  View is crisp.  Great for the hobby astronomer.  I am sure I will upgrade in the future but these are great casual starters.  Nice binoculars.
4,Big and bulky. Perfect for a tripod and they have great distance.
4,There a little heavy . Other then that very pleased.
3,My family and I like it very much. Thank you very much.
5,I've been able to see mag 7 and 8 stars in foggy nights ! the amount of light/detail is amazing !Consider getting a tripod and a good chair if you don't have one already.
5,Great pair of Binoculars  Easy to use and has remarkable clarity.  I have bought 2 others as gifts they were loved.
4,Works as expected. No real surprises.
5,Wonderful Binoculars well balanced and comfortable around the eyes. They are not for closer viewing but will bring an object 100 yards out right up close and personal. Sports stars and the moon animals in nature.  5 stars
4,I'm a little shakey so I bought the stand and it works gread
5,Great buyPros: Comes with a strap soft case lens covers fold down rubber boots on eye pieces for people that wear glasses.Cons: They are about 12" tall.I am satisfied with my purchase
3,They would have been nice if the collimation had been correct.I ended up getting the "Nikon 7238 Action Ex Extreme 8 X 40 mm" and I have been happy with them.
5,These things are soo good a little large but work very well. I got them while in Hawaii and I can see mountain ranges and from mountains to the some very fine detail. Highly recommend these things.
3,I Bought  this for my grandchildren  to loo6 at the stars but it doesn't go that far maybe the birds
5,Bought these on a flash sale and we love using them for gazing at the moon when we are camping. Much better than carrying a big (not great quality) telescope that we were previously using.
3,Seems to work good gives good views but while cleaning I noticed the front lens on the left eye main tube is cross threaded into the tube so it can not be removed if it needs cleaned.
5,Excellent product. Spectacular magnification. Worth the price. Arrived quickly well packaged easy to understand instructions for attaching the tripod mount.  Carrying case and cleaning cloth also included.  Neck strap could use a pad because the binocular is heavy and the strap thin.
5,For the money you can't go wrong with these. Clear focus and optics.I look at many pairs of binoculars before buying these and these are the best I found for under $600.I highly recommend them for anyone.
5,Just be aware the maginfication is such that it takes very steady hands especially for distance viewing.  Sure you can bring it to a ball game and count the players' nose hairs but the field of vision is better suited for fixed sky objects long-distance spotting or (fairly motionless) birds.  A tripod is strongly recommended.
5,Great buy and for those who are serious about the night sky then this bino does the job and then some. Enjoy like I do by I warn u to buy a very good tripod or else!
4,for the price they are very good. a bit bulky for bird watching.
5,I purchased these several months ago and they work great.The price is ridiculously affordable.You pay a little and get high end like optics.I use them mostly for terrestrial viewing and am very happy with them.Field of vision is great.
5,All was in good shape.  No complaints.  Was able to use to view the stars that week once the clouds moved out.  I do need a more sturdy tripod as these binocs are heavy.
5,Excellent value for the price can see many nebula on a clear Missouri night. Easily replaces all but the largest telescopes at a fraction of the cost and much more versitile and mobile.
5,These are a lot larger than I thought they would be but they do not weigh too much. I bought these in preparation of the lunar eclipse this weekend.
4,They are okI still need a pair for the left eye only
4,This is my first binouculars enjoying it so far.
5,Retirement present for my husband to enjoy the wildlife that inhabits our yard. He loves it. It brings the wildlife up close without disturbing their natural behavior.. Wonderful purchase.
4,Binoculars work fine my only gripe is that the price dropped after my purchase.I bought them for astronomy and they are good for that.
5,Superb product and responsible team
4,Nice optics for the price. Cheap neck strap.
4,Great astro views shows color but good sharp performance for the price!!!
5,I bought that product for my little nephew. He loved it. This is perfect for birds watching. We did not try it for astro watch. But I believe that it will solve the general purpose to see moon clearly.
5,If your intended purpose is to sit on your deck or just off the road and look at stuff you canât go wrong! Heavy we have ours on a tripod most of the time. Day and/or night great Binoculars.
4,Very good but heavier than I expected. Works well with a tripod.
4,On time good price good optics.  Happy.  Big though.
4,love it the only downfall for me is the weight of the product
4,Good pair binoculars Clearview good field of vision goodness for any better.
5,They were exactly what i expected very powerfull and tripod mont is nice can see better than i thought  came in perfect condition looking at the moon is like its right in front of me
5,Very powerful!
5,For the money you really can't complain.  Very clear and great magnification.
5,Can't go wrong with these bino's. I've also bought the 20x80 as well as the UltraView 10x50.
5,Great product! I was able to see a sign a mile down the road as clearly as if it were right outside my window. Great for the starting stargazer or someone who wants to see wildlife at a distance.
4,So much zoom I now need a tripod.
1,Look at the pictures. It speaks for itself. I spent over $90 and 3rd hand binoculars show up when I know The purchase I made were for a brand new set. This is unsat! A new pair are being sent to me. It should have been right the first time.
5,I chose this for star watching. It works great for the price paid. I usually mount it on a monopod with a ball swivel head.I now toss it in the car or suitcase when I travel.
5,Love these binoculars however they are a bit heavy so a good tripod is definitely recommended. Am able to pull astronomical objects closer than many telescopes. Very easy to attach to a tripod.
5,Love using these. Great detail - easily attach to a tripod for stability. Great view of the Moon and on a clear night nebulae are clearly visible. Much easier to set up than a telescope.
5,I bought these for my daughter because she likes to look at wildlife in the country. She actually uses the binoculars for a telephoto lens on her iPhone. The pictures actually come out great.
5,Might be a little to big and heavy for some people and kids. Nice product but will have to sell to get a smaller set so my kids can use them too.
5,Bought these for my husband.  These are very good binoculars.
5,These are wonderful binoculars for stargazers!  We even took them to the Badlands and other remote areas of South Dakota and pressed them in to service.  Would definitely recommend!
3,Huge glasses for only a 15 times power.  Two heavy to carry and not powerful enough to mount on a tripod.
5,Great bino's for the price.  Super for bird watching.  Now I need to get a tripod.
5,Love these!!!  Able to see the moons of Jupiter!! Yes they are big and heavy but that is to be expected. I use them with a tripod when looking at the sky.
5,My daughter says they are very nice!  Good value I guess have not seen them yet.  Since they live right near the gulf they should use and enjoy them often.
5,Get very nice views of the moon saw Orion nebula and Jupiter so far.  Great for the price.  You'll need a tripod for stability.  I recommend the Dolica ST-500 68-Inch Lightweight Tripod.Clear skies.
5,Love these but get a mono pod to hold them.  They are very powerful.  Great for star watching.
3,These binoculars are too long and too big and too heavy. People will make fun of you using them. I'm not sure why I didn't pick up on that fact before I ordered them.
5,The magnification on these is mind blowing. They are a tad heavy but not unbearably heavy. I look at almost everything with these. They are super clear!
3,I have used it for looking across a several mile area. Does good distance but so so focusing. But for the money Im happy.Going to look at the stars some day !
2,after about 1.5 years of use images were off center and the binocs were unusable.  It was never dropped or mishandled.  Celestron could fix them but it was not worth the price.  for $50 it was great while it worked.  would not buy again because not durable.  If you need one temporarily  it may be worth it but dont count on it.
3,This did not come with the tripod adapter ...
5,High quality optics. A bit heavy but that's to be expected when you buy a high quality set like these. I couldn't be happier with my binoculars. Thanks once again Amazon.
4,Good product for the price. Heavy!! Get a tripod.
3,Well the Binocular is O.K. but the eye piece on the left is stuck and can't be focused.  Already the manufacturer have been informed and Amazon already reimbursed me with a 25% of the total cost.
3,HUGE! I guess with telescopes and binoculars size matters
2,Useless on Alaska vacation because the right lens was cross threaded. Double vision. The lenses are glued into place so I was not able to repair. I could tell that they would have been great optical quality if they were calibrated. These binos are heavy and the thin strap will end up hurting your neck. The tripod adapter is a nice addition. These Probably would have been a great buy if they worked.
5,I have a pair of 7x35 Bushnell binoculars which weren't of high enough power.  I bought these based on the reviews worried they wouldn't be high enough.  I was wrong - their optics are fantastic and the zoom excellent.
5,Outstanding quality of optics and when you figure in the price these deserve 7 stars.I personally compared these to several other binos and these were among the highest quality but no where near the high prices of the others. Highly recommended.
5,Very Nice! These are great for low light conditions.  They're a bit heavy for extended use without a tripod but the payoff is the light gathering power.
3,Image quality at high zoom level is very mediocre. These are quite inexpensive for a super zoom binoculars so i guess you get what you pay for.
5,Oh my these are fantastic binoculars! We mainly use them for watching wildlife and they are the best binoculars we've ever had. They are heavy but no matter. Thinking of buying another pair for our daughters!
4,Very nice binoculars..nice tripod attatchment..looking forward to a starry night!
5,Excellent purchase
3,These binoculars are great for looking at the stars...with one eye. They seem to be not adjustable to "normal" eye placement which causes double-vision.
5,Excellent binoculars for looking skyward. Recommended to me by an astronomer I have not felt disappointed. Wish I had a tripod for it though as it would improve the star viewing experience.
4,Gives a nice close view. No zoom on this model.
5,I got the two day delivery and they arrived as promised. I was worried about columnation  issues I read about in reviews but mine are great.
5,The 15 x 70 allows focus 2 miles away on the ocean to see details I couldn't see with my nikon10 x 40 binocs.great value very durable highly recommend them.
5,These binoculars are powerful. Theyâre big but balanced.
1,I didn't realize until too late why the image was not quite clear in daytime...  Was it my eyes?  When I finally used them at night to look at the stars I finally realized that the image was doubled...  This means the two tubes are not lined up properly (collimated?).  So if I had looked at the stars when I first got them I would have easily seen the problem for what it was and sent them back.  As it is... well I guess I have to look into getting them repaired (or do it myself?).
3,My binoculars didn't come with a neck strap.
3,Got what I paid for.
5,Very happy with my combined purchase of the NightWatch: A Practical Guide to Viewing the Universe  Sky & Telescope's Pocket Sky Atlas and the Celestron SkyMaster Giant 15x70 Binoculars. Just waiting for some clear skys to really enjoy them...
2,Collimation off very substantially ... I will have to return and that is a hassle ... tripod mounted ... double images of even nearest objects.  There is no easy access to try and adjust collimation yourself.  They are being returned. ... Glad I saved the boxes
4,Good product. But need a tripod.
5,I hardly believe it's price. It's better than 127EQ telescope to me. Easy to find the star. No need to setup just you can use for watching.
3,Package arrived in a timely manner binoculars appear to be brand new the price was very good...except the right lenses must be mis-aligned and will have to ship the item to Celestron for repair.
4,good vision but a little to heavy
5,Good clear images easy to focus very wide range and not as heavy as I thought they'd be Captures light well.
1,Bought these hoping they would be my first much closer look at the stars and the moon on my own.  Received them and while they were well packaged I was thoroughly disappointed in what I saw in the view. I saw two moons!  I couldn't believe my eyes. I broke out the instructions and nothing was mentioned how to converge the separate moons. I tried again the next night thinking perhaps by magic things were not the way they appeared the first night but they were identical with duplicate images. I decided to return them and Amazon will provide a refund.
5,Great for viewing stars and comets at night. The view is very clear but just a little touchy on focusing in on objects not as smooth as I would like but other than that I love them.
5,Bought these for hunting and they can see forever. They are big ad bulky but work great for sitting in blinds and safari style hunting out of the truck in South Texas
4,98% I'm my book.....just missing the tri pod adapter.
5,Very impressive binoculars especially considering the price.
1,I will never buy this companyâs binoculars ever. Price was reason but I sent them back to factory once. Didnât matter. These are junk in my opinion! I am getting overlapping targets. You canât see objects like the moon as you get overlapping and really hard to explain images that are impossible to see image clearly! I did call customer service/repair section but got brushed off with little help!
4,Great binoculars for the price. No complaints here.
2,I read the instructions but no matter what I did I was seeing double. I called their support line and they told me to send them back as the collimation must be out. If this was a one off it would be ok but it seems like many other reviewers have the same problem which is unacceptable. I don't want to waste time shipping and waiting for replacements they should have better quality control.
4,bought this for my wife. She is very happy
5,EXCELLENT for this price.  I have an old military set of 14x80s and the optics on this are just as good at half the weight.
5,I bought these for my husband for Father's Day and he absolutely loves them!
2,At first I thought these were not too bad.  I was happy to be able to mount them on a tripod but only a couple weeks later and they have become nearly unusable.  Focusing 500 yards away I each object I focus upon shows up doubled like an evil twin.  I've tried every adjustment but I cannot make these work correctly.
5,Nice viewers for the price!  Very Pleased!
5,ABSOLUTLY love these SUPER  BINOCULARS ONLY COMPLAINT. WOWWEE ARE THESE BABBIES HEAVY!!!!
5,with the adapter mounts easily on my tripod.  would recommend using a tripod because of the weight.  like looking at the rocky mountains from my balcony. great purchase for the money.
2,I got these binoculars after reading great reviews about it. I have nikon 10 x 25 too bought these for star gazing. But  I see everything double with these binoculars ( two stars two trees besides each other when actually there is only one). I do not have any such problem with Nikon. Even after trying all adjustments on this one it didnt work. Think unfortunately I recived a defective pair.
3,Recently ordered these to do some amateur star gazing / view mountain ranges and when I received them they have double images.
4,Great value but not the best binoculars I have used
4,for the price you can't go wrong with it.  You could use this to look at the moon.  A++++++ for this product!
5,I love these-  we use them not only for the stars but wildlife as well! They really are amazing!  I never knew the moon or stars could appear like this!
5,Awesome
5,Great binoculars for the price. Sharp and light strong optics. 15 x is about the maximum magnification without having to use a tripod all the time. Perfect for land and sky observation.
5,These binoculars are excellent for the price. Very clear. Easy to focus. They are a little heavy so you may want to use a tripod for extended periods of time. Extremely satisfied!
5,These work great for daytime use and night sky viewing. Great value!
5,cant beat the price
4,Fast service and big binoculars.Need tripod to help steady.
5,Excelente ðð¼
2,These are worthless for Astronomical use as the manufacture used a CHEAP tripod mount that renders the binoculars useless for sky viewing.There is no way to steady them. Their next model up 20x80 has a great mount that is used by several other companies. I return these & purchased a 20x80mm one made by Berska which has the better mount. I got them at a great price. $99. from amazon and they work great! I recommend Barska ones instead & save some money.
5,Wonderful product this was purchased as a gift and she loves it they are big great for day and night time viewing we have ours on a tripod
5,They are the first binoculars I have ever bought.  The quality meets or exceeds what I had expected.  Adjustment was simple and viewing objects was a breath taking.
5,For the money these binoculars are amazing. Of course they are difficult to hand hold for viewing and for astronomical use you will need to use a tripod
5,ILIKE THIS ONES SO MUCH
2,Saw some reviews that collimation was off on some right out of the box. I got one of these. Things never looked right from the start.Focus was never very precise either. You get what u pay for. Spend a little more and get higher quality optics.
5,We have had plenty of fun looking at the constellations with these. The craters on the moon were really cool too. Don't expect to see Hubble-like images but you can definitely see more than with the naked eye. Good product for the price!
5,I'm currently deployed and run the scout truck while on convoy.  My gunner needs all visual advantages he can get and so far these binos have saved our butts several times.
1,I received the binoculars yesterday and went outside to try them but the middle focus wheel did not work so was not even able to say how the image quality was as I was unable to get them in focus.  I am sending them back and will be looking for another brand.  I am disappointed because I was really looking forward to seeing the moon with my granddaughter.
5,We love these for bird watching epically to watch the bald eagles on the lake . Awesome quality fast easy focus great to view the craters on the moon to .
5,These binoculars are impressive and great for viewing everything especially the night sky. Definitely recommend!!
5,These binoculars are a great value and are high quality.  I mounted them on a tripod and got some great views of Comet PanStarrs!!  I am looking forward to Comet ISON in November!!
2,We live in an apartment with great views of the Atlantic Ocean.  We wanted the binoculars to get clear views of the details of the commercial ships in the shipping lane about a mile or so away.  We couldn't see much beyond a macro outside view of the ships with no clear view of the deck crew ship parts etc.  I'll investigate a telescope instead.
5,i love this binoculars only downside? too heavy. (but that can be resolved using the included adapter and buying a tripod that fits your needs.) they are excellent i highly recommend them
5,Great product.  Works great. For best result get a tripod and look creapier than before ;) lol.
4,Good binoculars but very heavy.
5,viewed in hd high definition'm very happy with these binoculars five star was exactly what I wanted to see the naturelaza CreAcciÃ³n God and even the moon is seen in HD
3,They're good for bird watching but I don't recommend for night gazing.
1,Some years into the purchase and I just found out that the binoculars need a lot of adjustments from the beginning. Always thought Iâm too sensitive but now I read that the fine lines or double vision that I thought is normal is from a bad product. Disappointed  very disappointed
2,I purchased these in 2009 and took very good care of them.  The bridge connecting the two eyepieces just broke for no obvious reason.  Celestron says they will replace them with a new pair for $25 plus my shipping costs.  I'm not sure if it is worth the cost to get another pair.  They are also very heavy  They do work fine when not broken.
5,Nice to use and gaze closely at the stars while in the hot tub. Brings in so much of the heavens to see.
5,IT'S MORE THAN EXPECTED  NOT LESS!!  AWSOME  comes easily to mind!!  Arrived as promised or as shown on the tracking device!GIVE THE BOSS A RAISE!!
5,The binoculars are excellent. Everything is so clear through them. They can get heavy though so a tripod is nice to have. The adapter that came with the binoculars seems to be cheaply made though. But for $60 you can't go wrong with these.
4,JUST THE RIGHT SIZE FOR STAR WATCHING
5,We use these binoculars to view boats and ships.  We mounted them on a tripod they are easy to adjust and work quite well.  We would by them again.
5,Bought as a gift for my son and he LOVES them. He has even taken pictures of planets and stars with them.
4,Prompt delivery + product as described = ð
4,great viewing on a tripod  excellent value
5,Bought them for the wife for star gazing and ocean viewing. She loves them!
4,Need to buy a tripod for this product!
1,this is my second binos as i returned the first pair due to double vision the refunded pair has double vision as did the originals.also i had to pay an additional $30 to have the broke binos swapped out.I will contact manufacturer most likely to no avail unless I pay another return fee  for another useless product.Amazon should remove this product from their site!!!BEWARE cause you get what you pay for!!!!
4,Good.  I am not sure yet
5,I replaced my 10x50 and enjoy the better view...they can be used without a tripod with know problem.
1,Celestron SkyMaster Giant 15x70 Binoculars w/Tripod AdapterI purchased on of these and all you can say about it that is correct is it us large but 15 times is hardly any magnification and I doubt if these binoculars have that much plus adjustment are hard to adjust or either broken and you cannot adjust; also made in China and hard to get replacement and returning a object is like wishing you had never done business with this product. I have camera's with more magnification that are not a 15X70. Think about this one before you buy it.
5,Works as well as is mentioned in these reviews. Worth every penny even though it is made in China. Hopefully I can say this an a few years. Offers great visibility.
4,For he price these are great!
1,The rubber grip started to peeled off easily just by a little finger nail scratch.. the adapter they gave with it is useless & it's not stable at all & shakes! It lingers customers into purchasing it & makes it seem like it's a great 2 for 1 deal! hurrayy.. while Celestron knows very well that they made a metal & more stable adapter to make their customers repeat & buy the better one for $10 dollars more extra when that itself is similar to the default dummy adapter they give with the binos i mean whats the point?? next time just keep the adapter in China..
2,Well for $50 you don't expect the best binoculars!I did see M79 through bright city lights but one weak aspect of these is the "tripod adapter." The tripod adapter does NOT attach securely to the binoculars locking them into stillness. The tripod adapter is 3" of a decently thick plastic but this seems to be part of the shaking problem of the camera on the tripod.
4,Great binoculars for the price
4,very good for the money spent
5,Love it ð enjoy looking at planets & the moon
3,They work great.  But they are REALLY BIG!  Best for distances.  Stand recommended as they are a bit cumbersome and it can be difficult to hold steady.
5,I love it. I think it exceeds my expectations. The quality of the binoculars are excellent and I am very happy with my purchase. Thank you Amazon.com.
3,The Shymaster Giant was what I thought it was going to be and it gets the job done.  For a very low price I was able to see what I needed it for.
3,I bought these at the same time I bought the "Bushnell Falcon 7x35 Binoculars with Case" which I prefer. I like the adjustments better and they are easier to hand-hold.
2,Had high hopes for these but after trying 2 pairs both out of collimation and one with debris in one of the eyepieces I gave up. Great price for something that could be a great binocular drew me in and I regret it. Be careful with these. Color flair is significant leading to rainbow stars and lots of them too as there are double images. :(
5,Great binoculars but go ahead and get the tripod because you won't be able to see anything with it.
5,Awesome.  A tad heavy which is to be expected with something so powerful but I bought a neck harness and they work great.
5,Look amazing I love them. The Grand Canyon was so enjoyable through these the stars and moon as well. I recommend these to anyone on a budget that still wants a real pair of binoculars.
5,My eye glasses is a 600 degrees myopia  after I adjusted the binoculars  without eye-glasses still can see the things very clearly!!awesome!Very friendly to glasses wear.!
3,Would not open up wide enough to fit my eyesreturned for refund
5,Great Binoculars. For the price they can't be beat.
4,vg
2,It appears that the collimation/alignment is off I googled a bit and found some vids explaining how to fix it myself though I may call around some camera shops (if any still exist) and see it they know how to fix this.Fun fact many of the videos are of this exact model... buyer beware...
5,Good optics and performs well.
4,Good quality
3,i have been enjoying these for months now in both day and night time.  they are very shaky without some type of support.  mine did not come with a tripod adapter
5,the best ... I ll buy again and again!
5,Exelentes binoculares de buena calidad tanto en material de construccion como desempeno.  Los recomiendo tanto para uso terrestre o para uso astronomico ( yo los uso para los dos ) es una buena compra. Los remiendo ampliamente.
5,Excellent
5,Great price very powerful. I'm not an enthusiast but they seem very high quality.
1,These were great binoculars - the optics were clear and I loved using them. Right until they literally fell apart after minimal use.  First one of the eye cups fell off. Then the prism inside fell apart and I could hear it rattling around inside. Because I was on search and rescue in the field I actually took them apart and assembled the working pieces into a bastardized monocular that functioned enough to get me through the rest of the week.  They went in the trash after that.
3,The only thing I'd like see improved is to make it easier to focus. I have another pair of less powerful ones that have a lever you push up and down on to focus. On the Giant ones you have to rotate a wheel.
1,First time I tried to use these was to look at Jupiter and moons. Spent over an hour trying to get them to focus to no avail. Tried Stars and other objects but kept getting constant double vision. Read several reviews where others had the same problem. Returned for refund immediately !
5,Gave these to my husband as gift. He loves them! They are very good quality and the viewing is spectacular! Better than some telescopes weâve owned.
4,They work great a bit long.
5,my husband loves these..they work great but a hugh.  we took them to Cocoa Beach to watch the cruise ships and dolphins...they are very long and very heavy..but he still loves them..
3,Hard to focus always seems to be a little fuzzy
5,I have a place in upstate NY...  a dark sky and a lounge chair and the star gazing is awesome.  I've even been able to see the Moons of Jupiter with these.
4,My wife loves them
5,You can see a long way away with these.  Heavy though
3,Not bad for the money. Make yourself a solid tripod adapter and enjoy the skies at low cost. It's not the greatest instrument but certainly gets you started.
5,Fantastic just look for ways to keep it steady and in a dark night you will be amazed!!! Buy a book about binoculars and astronomy as a guide. You will be extremely happy with both!!!
2,After owning these for a couple of years I can say that they are a piece of junk. The view through them is not much better than with the naked eye and they cannot be calibrated as there is no diopter ring to focus them properly. Wish I had bought something else.
4,Good for the money.
5,Great pair of binoculars. Fast focus tight quality. You may need a tripod for extended viewing.  I have an older pair of binocs from Celestron they do a great job. Enjoy.
4,Clear focus and lightweight
3,Have the impression the lenses don't align as well as they should so image not as sharp as I would like.
1,This is a very cheaply built product. If that is what you want then this is it. But there are some drawbacks:- The focus adjustment is very poor moving quickly in some areas and sticking in others.- Black rubber casing exudes a strong paint odor that does not diminish over time.- The casing also leaves an oily residue on anything it comes into contact with.- Eyepiece covers don't fit well causing them to fall off frequently.Well worth a few extra dollars to get a decently built set.
4,Great for the price
3,nice glasses but very heavy for the ladies
4,great for the price
4,wish they were adjustable
3,This thing is much bigger than I thought from the picture and got some weight to it.  They should put this next to pop can so you can see.
3,Not what I thought I was ordering but they do fine.  A little big for my 5 year old grandson but he loves them.
5,I am completely satisfied.  Clarity and performance is great.  A tripod is needed to hold steady.  I purchased the recommended Dolica tripod 66inch.  The combination works great.
5,Good!
5,The quality for the price was perfect for me. Great to see the space needle fire works from my house. Shipped quickly made it for Christmas.
5,bought binoculars to use when huntig and to spot in my rounds on targes when dialing dialng in scopes kill too birds wih one stone cand spot game and use as spotig scope
4,good optics easy focus.
5,Great price And works fantastic !!!! was shipped fast with no problems!! A++++
5,Great value; very sharp focusing at long distances. No obvious optical distortions.
4,Heavy.
1,This is junk or their quality control is extremely poor. Mine has double vision (objects appear twice). One of the lenses (the long tube) was not properly screwed in. the metal bracket that holds the prisms in place got loose inside the lens one ot the prisms appear damaged a piece of plastic was broken. Anyway too long a list but bottom line is: unusable. You get what you pay for of course.the only good thing is actually the price: throwing it in the garbage will be a relatively minor loss.
5,Amazing! These are great binos for the price. Naturally there are some movement due to the huge magnification but I can see the craters on the moon perfectly!
1,Bad experienceIâm really upset about issues I was purchased for moonshine but canât access see the moonDonât spend the money here
5,For the price these glasses are fantastic. I think they're easier to hand hold than I thought they'd be at least for an adult. I may even buy the step up; which is the 20 x 80's although these are really great.
5,Great value! We are enjoying watching wild-life in our area. Good quality at a very good price.
2,Pros: Cheap they look cool they work if you have duct tape.Cons: the quality is laughable I was waiting in anticipation for these to arrive in the mail only to be let down by the poor craftmenship of these binos. Picture this you open the box in anticipation of playing with your new toy only to have it fall to peices right out of the box.really.
4,nice but heavy
3,A bit disappointed. Causing me a headache because it's not adjusted good.
4,Love it
5,Optics are great and customer service is good as well. I was impressed with their easy and helpful customer service.
5,I saw stars not even my telescope allowed me to see. Finding out one of the stars in Orion's belt is a star cluster was amazing.
5,This is a great set of binoculars. I use them for target spotting when shooting. Works well at 100 yes. Have not tried it at a longer distance.
5,Great binoculars. We are 100% satisfied crisp and clear viewing. Perfect size not too heavy for hand held viewing..
1,it was cheap. To heavy to hold  by hand you need a tripod and it would drift in and out of focus.I bought it because I thought it was a good deal. I would be better off using what I spent as a down payment on a good one.The was my second purchase. The first was defective on arrival so the sent me a second. The second one gradually became blurred / double vision ( like the first one)  few months.
4,Thank you
5,Love these!!!!!
5,Using them for about a year now while hiking. Havent found anything better yet.
4,Great but heavy.
5,Great binoculars. At 15x they are great for finding astronomical targets.  The low magnification makes hand holding possible.
2,do not expect much for what they cost culmination was way off fixed that with adjustment screw. knew there would be a lot of ca. there is a lot. biggest problem is stars and planets are not pinpoint they smear out to the left even with one eye closed.  but like i said for what they cost what can you expect. day time viewing is ok.
4,excellent very good
5,Amazing ð product the best binoculars in the market. I almost touch the super moon.
5,We are very happy with these binoculars!  They are heavy but they make up with their view! We will buy a few more !
1,I canât tell the difference this pair show the same as my Nikon 10x22x50 and my Nikon magnify x22 this pair doesnât come close.
2,I do not know if the pair I have are defective or what. I use them primarily to look at objects in the ocean. The images lack clarity and the diopters are difficult to get into focus. I have a pair of 7x50 Tascos that are far superior in clarity and power. If it were not for the kindness of amazon's refund policy I would have been totally stuck
5,Great for the novice or experienced star gazer. A must have even if you own a regular telescope. Clear views and amazing optics. Use with your telescope for enhanced star gazing.
1,3 separate sets including two returns for replacement -all with the same prism alignment error but to varying degrees. I have given up on returning them!!!I bought this pair  to supplement a 10 year old identical set (and incidentally I had given 9 sets as Christmas presents in 2006)The optical alignment is in error- either they all have been dropped from varying heights or they were not manufactured /aligned properly.Do not waste your effort or money.Buy another manufacturer's optics.
5,Got this for grandpa to help him go hunting. The zoom is great but so strong that any slight movement will get you to drift 100 feet from the target.
5,this is an excellent binoculars objects are really clear even from a distance and this binoculars is easy to use...its a bit heavy but strongly built..excellent for night viewing especially watching the moon at its full..i highly recommend this product
3,Do you want me to return them...the adapter was not in the box is it coming under separate packaging.  This is my third request for this piece.
5,We live on the Banana River in Cocoa Beach these are the best binocs I`ve ever owned and I own about a dozen pairwill use for full moon rise tonight!
5,Love this! Works really well and easy to use!
1,The binoculars are great!  I intended using them with a tripod and also purchased it - only to find that the adapter wasn't included with the binoculars! As a result I can't use my binoculars as they are too heavy to hold. Celestron advised the adapter SHOULD have been included - and it's written in the advert. So overall not happy at all.
5,I was surprised whith very fast shipment and very good packingWhat I like about this binoculars is the clear vision and easy adjustmentI recommend it definitely and worth buying...
2,These have a great range of distance and allow enough light for what would be a clear image however the lenses (at least in the ones I received) are vertically off.  There is a horizontal adjustment but not vertical so everything appears to have a double vertically.  It appears as if the lenses have been twisted bent or just improperly put together.  Pretty disappointed in this product.
3,Binoculars are well made and perform as advertised but are much larger than I expected and also quite heavy.
5,We live in Alaska and needed a new pair of binoculars badly. After reading all the reviews this is what I decided to go with. Delighted with the detail.
5,Really great Binoculars.  I got to actually see stars for the first time with my own eyes.  Good quality too!
5,Great binoc's.  Very bright and clear.  Had no problems using them without a tripod.  Also got the Bushnell 20X and while they do magnify a little more they were much darker than these Celestron's.  Definetly recommend if size if not an issue.
5,Very powerful.
5,These where lighter then I expected so they're not hard to hold for star gazing or keeping and eye out for predatory big cats coyotes or other wild life
4,works well
5,much better than expected love them
5,Although a bit large these are the best for the price love them buying more as Christmas gifts for the men in my life. Fast shipping!
5,This should of came with a real tripod instead of some cheap tripod. But the binoculars very cool can see jupiter and moon very impressive highly recommended for camping trips.
3,did not come with tripod adapter as listed in the ad and no listing for contact information.
2,Got it as part of a hot deal. Since I paid a minimal amount I decided to keep it but as others have mentioned the collimation is awful. You're going to get a bad case of double vision and though I was able to adjust it some there is still some misalignment. Oh well. It's still otherwise usable and had decent optics.
1,Returned the first one because the optics wer not aligned. Basically it was cross-eyed.  The replacement was better but the focus adjustment (pin) sheared on the fouth time using the binoculars. Now there is no focus unless you can slide the eyepieces out just right to simulate the focus action.  This rarely works and the eyepieces generally just fall out.On the bright side it LOOKS impressive sitting on the window sill looking out over the water. Just dont touch it like an antique telescope.
1,I KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG BY THE PRICE. BUT I THOUGHT I WOULD TAQKE NA CHANCEAND ORDERCELESTRON IS AN EXCELLANT BINOCULAR. SO IT TURNED OUT TO BE A SCAM. AMAZON SHOULD GET RID OF THEM THEY WILL NOT RETURN ANYTHING. AND THEY HAVE ALL OUR CARD NUMBERS. MOST LIKELY PEOPLE WERE ATTRACTED BY THE PRICEWHICH CAUGHT MY EYE ITS TO BAD THEY R CROOKS SO IF THEY SELL ANYTHING ELSE I WILL GIVE A WARNING NOT TO BUY. THE CELESTRONS ARE EXEPTIOAL  GLASSES FOR T WILL SE.E
5,Solid and great for watching the splendors of the Puget Sound and the Olympic Mountains
5,I love them. I look at a bunch of star and it is so cool how many are really up there. My sister loves them and is getting a pair
5,Great
5,I went full blown shellshocked after opening the box and holding them because they're even better than I expected! Everyone should own a pair of these!
5,Great product
1,After reading the many mixed reviews I decided to give these a shot.  Mine arrived totally out of collimation.  It took me about 4 seconds to realize they were worthless and were heading for a return.  They produce two images that cannot be resolved or focused in any way.  I suppose if you get a pair that works they might be OK but my advice would be to skip these and use the money as a down payment on a decent pair of binos.
5,Needed these for my Astronomy class. It's amazing how close they brought everything. I truly suggest a tripod as they tend to get heavy after a while. Would definitely buy these again.
5,This item is amazing. Love looking at the stars
5,Duel use to search my property or search the night sky
3,These are very good but are difficult to keep steady you almost need to have a tripod to use them effectively.
5,Great performance. I missed the 20x80's from another manufacturer that had to be sent back to the manufacter (twice). These have been flawless. Highly recommended.
5,You'll love this Binocular...get a good tri-pod and set up for Full Moon watching...nice for the price ! I would buy this item again...they work just fine!
5,Works pretty good  had the same problem everyone else did trying to find out how the mount was attached  see photo
5,I used these last night and the stars looked truly beautiful. I live around a city so it's hard to see the stars....but I saw a lot last night!
5,Excellent for night sky wide field of vision and clear bright images. Cons: Fairly heavy but with tripod works well. Good price. We recommend
5,Amazing clarity. My eye sight is fading and this brings in so much more light. Love these bino's.
1,This is junk.  I could not get the diopter to focus (right eyepiece) at all.  After a day or two of fiddling with it put it into a drawer and forgot about it. I found it today and thought I would give it another shot. In the process of attempting to understand the problem the diopter simply broke.  After examining it determined that this is simply cheaply made and poorly assembled.  Useless.  I should have requested a refund immediately.  My bad.
5,If you want the absolute best Binoculars in the world here it is... WOW it's amazing the power and clarity... Great for Moon Stars or anything else. Fun and easy to use :)
5,Excellent quality. Received in time for Christmas. Great for stargazing or bird watching.
1,No matter how we tried to adjust these binoculars there was always double images.  Had to use only one lens to see a single image.  I considered them to be un-usable and promptly returned them to Amazon.
3,The tripod adapter does not fit the Binoculars no way to use them and also I recommended these to others and they have same problem
5,Bought this as a Christmas gift for my dad and he loves them
5,Great product for the price.
3,It looks that you can ser far them are so Big AND DIFICULT TO HANDLE
5,I use these for watching the moon and wildlife the clarity is amazing you can see the craters on the moon!
5,Very nice for the cost.
1,If you buy these binoculars you will be greatly disappointed. I've decided the best use is for an anchor for my inflatable pontoon boat. The are heavy and you can only see double images. Why Amazon continues to sell these baffles me. I bought mine in 2014 and I see they're still listed for sale. These are a waste of good metal and optics.
5,THE BEST BINOCULARS I HAVE EVER OWNED! CLEAR CRISP AND TOTALY AMAZING!
2,Item arrived quickly and in good condition but unfortunately I too have double images...vertically and horizontally.  That's too bad since the binoculars look great and feel great in the hands.  The eye relief is quite nice too.  Amazon is great with the refund and return pick-up as usual so I'm reordering to see if I will have better luck on the next draw.
5,I completely loved it. Just started using it and so far its been brilliant. The view of the moon was stunning. Not as heavy as I expected it to be but a tripod is recommended for extended use.
5,Great product!  You can see the stars and planets so clearly as if you could reach out and pluck a star from the sky.
5,These binoculars are awesome! Everything looks so crisp and clear they really are worth the money. Only thing is that they are a little heavy so you will need a tripod for long period use but other than that...they rock!
5,Very clear viewing. Could actually (very slightly) make out patterns on Jupiter when held very still.
5,These things are awesome. Been using them for years. Now I live where I can bird watch. Really happy I bought these.Great product ata  good price.
5,Really nice astronomy binoculars for a very low price.  Best when used with a tripod due to weight and magnification as with any 70mm x 15x binoculars.
5,Clear and really really good.These feel like a much more expensive product. You can see the surface of the moon with extremely good detail.
5,These things are huge!  You wouldn't want to take them to the football game...
5,They're better than I expected.  They arrived just in time to see Nova Delphini 2013.  Would have had a hard time finding it with my old 7x50's.
5,I have these and they let lots of light in and are clear to see through.  They really bring things in clear and close.
5,This is just fantastic.so clean and clear vision.its also useful for games shows and night sky observation too.its come with tripod clip which is also very useful
3,Big view for small things.  Very useful for watching birds and sun bathers!  Birds don't mind but some sun bathers get upset.
3,Should have bought a better set.  This pair not steady enough to really zoom in on something.  Is this enough words?
5,Great Product!
5,Excellent. Pleasantly surprised!
5,I AM NOT IN TOWNi did not get my binocular yet? i will let you know later when i get my CELESTRON SKYMASTER GIANT.  CYRUS
3,Good optics not optimal collimation (see double). poor focuser system.Not expensive.The tripod adapter isn't firm enough the binos doesn't stop shaking.
5,but for its size it should be.  Husband loves these binoculars to look across the harbor... at the boats came with nice case and strap
1,These binoculars were a huge disappointment.  No matter what or where I looked could not focus on anything.  It was like having double vision.  I see now on the reviews that ALOT of people have had this problem.  These might start out ok from the factory but when they ship they get all screwed up inside and no way to fix them without a professional.  So from now on I will go to a local shop for binoculars.
5,the best for the price.
1,Incredibly careless re-packaging.  Whoever did this just threw everything into the box and taped it up.  Fingerprints on lenses!  No concern or care for product.  So far there doesn't seem to be any damage but I will able to tell with a few uses.  Any problems and I will return item.  Shame on Celestron!!!  This is not a criticsm of Amazon even though I could tell that the item was re-packaged before I opened it.
5,These are quite large but I'm still able to hold them in my hand and do my gazing. Very clear optics for the price.
5,By far the best of my binoculars....Great at the Target range with my tripod. Spec's are accurate.  A great bargain at that price.
5,Bast binoculars I have ever hed!
3,not exactly as described... there is no zoom and there is no tripod connector but they work awesome for the price...
5,Just what I wanted for use in birding.  Have to use a tripod for a steady view but these things are powerful and crystal clear.
3,great for watching the stars and moonbutthat's about it. There big and a little awkward to hold for long periods of time.
2,Optically these binoculars are very nice. However the pair I got suffers from a horrible misalignment that makes me have to tilt them to one side almost to where I can't see through one eye-hole in order for the image to line up properly. If I look straight I see two images at an odd diagonal.Related note: makes a fantastic monocular.
5,Cool
5,It's exactly what I wanted for amateur astronomy.  High quality and reasonable price.  It's small enough to be convenient to use but large enough to provide good views.
3,Don't be dissapointed performs like a " less than 100 dollar" scope.
5,these are huge!! but you cant beat the optics for the money...love them
5,Best $60 I ever spent. Optical quality is very good. Delivers great views of many fainter Messier objects that my 40 mm binos barely pick up.
5,Excellent -- fits my needs perfectly. Solid easy to use from a reliable company.
5,Great value if you like to watch the stars are a bird watcher or just like to explore nature. Clear bright view and easy to use.
5,Spectacular viewing.  I live in the city and was still able to see star clusters.  Very happy with my purchase.
3,I should have returned these when I had the chance. I simply don't have very much use for them.
3,1. Heavy;2. Too many adjustments needed;3. Outcome is poor than the preparations it takes to callibrate it.
5,GREAT I RECOMMEND THE STORE
3,The length of the lenses allow for shaky viewing. Must have steady hands to use. Some difficulty in focusing.
5,Exceeded my expectation. Will definitely recommend this binoculars to the avid outdoors-man or armature star gazer. The one drawback would be the weight a small sacrifice for powerful viewing capability.
5,Great improvement over my old binoculars.  They are long but the view is fantastic.  Easy to use would purchase again.
5,Yes it did! This was a gift & they are very pleased with themâ¼ï¸ðð¼
1,They put out a crappy product! I wonder what quality control they have wherever they're made in China. If anyone would have tried focusing these things they would have found out right away that it was impossible. What a huge let down. I may be suspicious about Celestron in the future and advise everyone else to be the same. I sent them back thanks to Amazon for that. I went to Orion and bought their binoc's and am extremely happy.
3,These are much longer and heavier than we expected.  They do have good resolution but are not convenient to carry anywhere.
3,Not too bad  but a bit hard for the eyes when you stop looking in the lens
1,We cannot see anything at night. It is not as big as we thought it was a waste of money.
5,Truely impressed with the quality and cannot believe the price!  Am planning to order more for gifts....If you are not familiar with binoculars...be sure to read instructions for focusing.
5,They were exactly like they were described.  But they were to big for my husband's taste so I had to return them.
3,Very clear at a certain distance but I could not adjust for equal clarity at maximum range for both eyes.
5,Work great. Bought an inexpensive tripod which helps steady the viewing.
3,I tough it was more powerful but its ok
3,Great for distant objects but looses focus on objects within 50 feet.  Would not recommend these binoculars for bird watching.
3,Got them to view the space station. No quite the magnification that I had expected. Good otherwise.
5,Very impressive excellent quality
5,A bit heavy to tote around but great to have a home.  I would get these because the price is great compared to the quality.
3,Easy to use very good view of the Moon. Can see 4 moons of Jupiter. 1 moon of Saturn. However binoculars shake even when on a tripodwhen my face nudges them or I touch them with my hands. The shake makes it difficult to get the satisfaction of observing things for some time...
5,I got this binoculars because I read all the reviews.  When I got them I immediately went outside and tried them. Super view. Get them
2,Too heavy and no zoom feature.
3,High capacity binoculars really failed in securing the lenses. First time I cleaned them one of the lenses popped out.
1,I'm  not at all satisfied I'm sorry to say but neither binocular will focus to eye I had friends look at them and it's not me .
5,Haven't used binoculars this powerfull since I was in the navy back in 1948. Best used on a tripod to steady view once a target is sighted.
5,It was nice on my recent trip to use it and I loved it.
1,I don't know if it's because of my astygmatism but I could never get these centered. I've been trying for months. No matter how I try I'm always left seeing double. I'll get it so close to being one object and a slight movement reverses the double image. I've tried with my glasses without my glasses. It just doesn't work. Think I'll go for a telescope next time.
5,Heavy good set; good seller
5,Used it on recent trip to Banff. Works Great for the price it came of.I recommend to buy. Note- it's bit heavy though*
5,These are gigantic.
5,work great but are vary heavy can see all the way across the lake. and could see the moon with them. really cool
3,The tripod mount is so flimsy that it shakes even if you are not touching anything.
5,Fantastic buy. If I ever need another pair this is where is the ones I will buy.
5,It's a great piece and I feel during my expedition it's really gives more enjoyment than before. My lilttle daughter also enjoys by looking moon so closely.
1,I wasn't lucky with this binoculars and sent them back for a return.  Left side remains soft and can't come in focus (yes I tried to focus both sides with the same eye).  It also has a highly pronounced color fringe around objects (a.k.a. chromatic aberration).  The right side is fine. Perhaps this item was meant as a monocular :-)Since the price is very attractive (as most reviews point out) I will order another one and hope for better luck.
5,Went out to a dark spot to check the binocular and was surprised with what you can see with it. Its really great buy
5,My husband really likes them says there kinda heavy so we might get z tripod as well
3,Not bad for the price but heavy to hold and somewhat hard to get in focus.
2,Collimation is off...it is difficult not to see double. Also the tripod adaptor is wobbly. The screw adaptor is the problem. It should have additional support for the front of the binoculars. Thinking about returning the item if I can't tolerate looking at planets and stars.
3,Delivery was good thanks
5,These are amazing they were affordable and powerful with a tripod I'm all set
3,Very heavy you need a good tripod
3,Haven't used the item but once or twice. Noticed culmination issues. Hopefully it can be fixed.
5,This is my first binocular didn't know what i was buying into but am pleasantly surprised with the quality of these optics. Luckily mine came in good collimation condition.
3,Difficult to focus.
5,best. great use to watch my son compete in high school rifle matches with no problem seeing his scores.
1,The binoculars arrived with collimation problems. Still allowing for the slight double vision I expected to have at least a clear view but the darn things were not as clear as my cheap-o Tasco's. Like looking through haze.  The one star was for Amazon's great return policy.  I give these things a -1!  They would make a great boat anchor. These reviews giving these binoculars high praise must be from a bunch of drunks!!
5,These Binoculars are awesome they are great for any kind viewing I was very impressed that you can actually see the Moons surface .Very Cool !!'Worth every Dollar!!!!
5,binoculars do everything as describedno problems with alignment (as described by some reviewers)going to buy another pair (or maybe 20/25 power) for myself
5,We took two of these on an Alaska cruise and they were invaluable.
5,very satisfied  thank you for asking.Mike Barry
5,Work as advertised but as others have said these are not lightweight. May require some users to use a tri-pod stand.Great quality...best Binocs I have ever used.
5,These are amazingly comfortable for prolonged use and provide a crisp view. I'm very pleased.
5,Wow for the price these are great and good quality
3,Not as solid as I thought it would be especially the mechanics near the eyepiece.
5,Excellent!!!  Boyfriend uses it for star gazing.Thank you very much.  Terrific quality and price. My boyfriend checks the night skies and is never disappointed.
5,great binoculars definately need a good tri[pod mount!
5,Great binoculars with good magnifiying. The weight is optimal for using without tripod. The technical support is excelllent.
5,Great value exactly what I wanted. Don't forget to buy a tripod as it gets heavy in  your hands after a minute or two.
5,Excellent--Received Exactly as Described.
5,although large in size still relatively light. Amazing the distance and clarity that is provided with this pair of binoculars.
3,it is heavy and hard to hold still but very good for the money
5,gf bought me these and everyone loves it. You can see reeeeeeally far with these i use em to look at the city from my balcony.
5,Crisp clear image day or night. Focus and overall operations are very good. Excellent for stargazing and looking at the moon!
5,I use these with my GLASSITUP digiscoping adapter. Great combination.
5,Great deal for the price.  The ratings are accurate.  Quality is super eye cover not so great strap is so-so. Thank you.
1,Misaligned. Had to climate myself. Hard to get to collimation. Rubber wouldn't adhere afterwards.As 2 monoculars it's OK but the plastic lenses show them self as inferior. Wasted my $ and expectations.Collimation won't stay in place.Seller didn't give full information. Not sure I trust their reviews now. They copied reviews of main product page. It wasn't new.
5,Loved these but foolishly wanted more power and sent these back for the 20x80s which were out of alignment right out of the box....
5,These are some big binoculars.  You really need a tripod with these as they are hard to hold still.  Good view.
5,Excellent value
3,Nice unit for the price.  Tripod adapter was NOT included in the package.
5,Bought them for stargazing and so far they've been amazing.I don't use tripod and I don't think it is necessary for getting good views.
5,When my dad gave me these...i was shocked on how big it was.  I felt i was a tank commander like Patton or Rommel....OMG!
5,excellent choice...really good price...love it !!
2,The build quality is good. However the optics are subpar cannot use both eyepieces at same time as the image doesn't line up.
3,It's OK
5,Really impressed. Bought them because a friend had a pair and because of the power over my 10x50s. Easy to focus bright and clear and could almost watch the ticks crawl on a deer's back at 100 yards.
3,too  bulky
5,Perfect "SPOTTERS" for incoming ducks & geese!!!  As well as sighting-in rifle hits & misses at two-hundred fifty(250) yards!!!
5,A great value for the price!
5,A gift
1,I was very disappointed when I received celestron skymaster GIANT binoculars and discovered there was no zoom feature.  Without this feature I can see the stars almost as good with my magnifying glass!  These are junk!  Please do a better job describing such merchandise in the future although I know the main objective is to sell sell sell sell..... Carl Nichols San Jose  Costa Rica  Central America.
5,They are great. The only problem is they are heavy thus you get shaking when holding them. A tripod would be best to use with them.
5,great buy!!
5,Got these for my husband to look at the stars and we absolutely love them! The clarity is incredible. Great buy for the price.
3,It works fine for looking at the moon but not the planets
5,Good value;excellent price. However really need stand to mount it on so will remain still while viewing. hard to do without a stand.
2,Optics are so-so.  You get what you pay for.  The plastic tripod adapter is cheaply made and has no torsional rigidity.  Will vibrate the mounted Binoculars side to side for a VERY long time making Horizontal streaks of stars.  Hard to quell vibrations when mounted on tripod.
3,Not that great blurry heavy and hard to hold still but great price though
5,Bought these for my husband for a gift (after we moved to the country) for watching wildlife and night sky watching.  He loves them!
5,excellent value these binoculars are lightweight and provide a very clear image. surprised by their 'big' size - but well worth  it.
5,it was good experience seeing moon with this product. Overall this is of great quality. But kind of heavy.
5,We could not believe how the moon & stars came into focus the family loved using it.  Make sure you use a tripod.
5,fast delivery and got what i expected thanks great job
5,great zoom in. and not as bad to carry as some suggested in other reviews
2,Bought these several months ago. I thought I just didn't know how to use them. Had a friend come and he said they are bent and will not focus right. Maybe I can get them fixed. On the upside I can use them as two telescopes one at a time.
5,I TRYED THIS BINOS UP CLOSE AS WELL AS FAR OFF AND THE VIEW IS VERY CLEAR EITHER WAY. A TRIPOD WOULD BE HELPFULL BUT ALSO WORKS WELL HAND HELD.ALL IN ALL I LOVE THIS BINOS.
5,Awesome and very powerful. Well constructed. They are HEAVY.  Get a nice tripod for it. Just get it !!! Your eyes will be delighted.
5,Great clarity and range. I would highly recommend for amateurs to own.
3,Good for long distance need to have a support to prevent shaky picture
5,Excellent viewing with these big suckers. They are a bit heavy for steady hand-held viewing but that's why it comes with the tripod adapter.
5,perfect gift
5,love these great for birds also and stargazing!!!
3,Ok but not as clear as I thought they would be
5,These binoculars work very well!  Great for looking at the details of the moon and the stars in the sky!  Amazing!
2,Very low quality you cannot see anything threw these besides the moon as for astronomy just cheap priced pair of big binoculars listed as  you  can explore the Cosmos with these and you cannot just big lens that do nothing more as a good pair of 10x50's
5,These binoculars are awesome.Bring views in so close with great clarity.Not as heavy as others have mentioned.Would recommend to anyone
5,very clear images   barely able to see the Galilean moons here there's a lot of light pollution.
5,Bought this item for a friend. He says that it is great and he's glad I purchased this particular one.
5,Now we can see all around the lake and great for sky watching at night.
5,Love it
3,Very hard to hand hold and focus.  Fine on a tripod.
5,trÃ¨s bien
5,Great product.  I should have noted that it was a Giant size.  It was a bit Big.
5,Unless you want to pay much more for the same thing these binoculars are worth every penny.  I have no regrets.
5,These are THE best binoculars I've ever owed. I use mine for servilelance and they work great. Quality is above and beyond.
3,Very heavy and hard to hold still
5,Fantastic - great buy for the money!! Awesome viewing was able to see the rings of Saturn! I would recommend a tripod for extended viewing.
1,Junk...Pure Junkdouble vision  out of the box with no searchable fix(Google) or celestron....$65.00 down the drain...Don't see why I should have to pay to ship back a defective product and wait for another pair that might work.....Really disappointed..I purchased only because they have such high numbers of positive reviews...now starting to wonder if companies pay people to post great reviews for junk products....plan mad
5,Bigger than I had expected but they are perfect for my needs.  I am a lineman and I use them to inspect structures.
5,I don't know about the others but I get the collimation real fast.... Nice! I recomend ThaÃ­s product to person interested in astrÃ´nomy
2,To me... the visual quality was poor and the magnification for sky watching fell way short of useful. The build quality seems very good and it mounted to my tripod easily and firmly.
5,Works great I am pleased with my purchase. I recommend the tri pod theses specs are a little heavy on the front end.
2,I am 50 years old and a slim lady. This item is really heavy for me I couldn't even hold it long enough to watch something. Also I could never focus anything I wasn't able to watch a bird not even a star which looked only as a refulgence.
5,Cool
5,Great purchase
2,When they arrive collimated you have a great deal but it's simply not worth the time and money waiting for a pair with properly functioning optics. There must be something seriously wrong somewhere along the production line in the factory resulting either in no/poor inspection or weak lens elements/prisms/housing...
5,Well worth the money.  Nicer  that the 10 X 50's that I spent $150 on.
5,Good quality and easy to use don't problem with the focusnice for plane spotting and wildlife
1,Product is not what it is described to be. The manual tells no you how to zoom in and out with the leverage but guess what it didnât come with one so you can zoom in and out. Waste of money
5,What can I say that hasn't already been said? These are terrific binos. They don't feel cheap I can tell you that much.
5,This is a great product for the price.  Very clear viewing.  I was a bit concerned about weight.  But that really is not much of a problem as it is well balanced.
5,One of the best at this price range.Little heavy but this is expected .Highly recommended
3,not that much magnification for the size of these binoculars
2,The ability to see long distance including the night sky was why I purchased these.  They failed.  Difficult to focus and not that powerful I went back to the old cheap binoculars I already had and which do a better job.  Sorry these don't work.
2,I purchased this gift in January for my grandson whose birthday is in March. There is a free floating metal piece inside. Ridiculously enough I can't exchange it! I bought this for the blood moons and live in a cold climate so we didn't use it until recently.
5,Exactly what i expected ..excellent packaging !!
5,Awesome binoculars. Feels like I can see almost as close as a telescope but even better because the image isn't inverted.
5,Off to college and my kid mentioned to me that the Dean of Physics/Astronomy saw these and provided a compliment on the wise choice of optics.
1,Seller forgot to look through the binoculars:  They are severely out of vertical collimation.  The moon for instance looks like two moons separated by approximately 2 1/2 moon diameters.  I plan to attempt to separate the binoculars for use as two monoculars.  If this is unsuccessful they will be junk.  It is not worth my time and effort to return them.
5,love them!
5,Quality and price.The best optics I have ever used at distance over water.These impress everyone that try's them out.
5,Great Binoculars for the price very good quality and very powerful. I could see the 4 moons of Jupiter.
5,These were for my boyfriend and he loves them. I think they are better than he expected ;)
5,Excellent product! I have owned other binoculars and paid much more for them but this one beats them all. Highly recommended.
5,Really awesome binocs!
2,Not the best quality in my opinion. Optics could not be fixated on any 1 object w/o getting dizzy. Big f not.
3,The price reflects the quality. But they work just fine.
5,Cheap and quality. Take care of near sighted people. But this is heavy! Too heavy to be a mobile solution.
3,very good binocular but it arrive not functional. Need colimation.
1,At first these seemed to work well now 6 months later - they don't focus at all.  I have tried EVERYTHING and it turns out this is a common complaint with these binoculars.  Unfortunately I only saw really positive reviews when I bought them.
5,beats my telescope in clarity its realy an amazing astronomical device i would recommend this -- with use on a tripod for more stable viewing...
2,You get what you pay for. From the beginning It had double vision effect. By just a little bit. (Confirmed with 5 other people who tried binocular with me) Built on a cheap side. Straps are very weak and thin and kind of cuts into your neck.
5,it was a birthday gift for my husband. it is exceptionally well made and has everything included. i would definitely recommend it to anyone.
5,Love it
5,Celestron SkyMaster Giant 15x70 Binoculars with Tripod Adapter        Â â
1,Shipped in retail box.Was out of alignment out of the box seems to be a very common problem.Waste of time returned.I can't believe this item gets Amazon Choice when they are so many complaints of it being a bad product.
5,Hold it Steady.. And the View is Great
5,An excellent product.  Performs amazingly well for both celestial and terrestial viewing.  Not the best for birding because of its magnification levels.
5,The price was great and they work spectacularly! I've used them for bird watching and star gazing. Tripod adapter easy to use.
5,These were a gift for my brother for Christmas.  He was very pleased with them great strength but a bit heavy.
5,strong strong views...but limited on the view....huge magnification....little smaller field of view !!
5,Great! As advertised. Arrived as promised.
1,I purchase these on 2017 and already showing signs of fungus on main lens. already broke them trying to repair them please dont waste time or money
5,Awesome!Fun late in the evening and of course at night.
5,Wife has trouble holding it steady but we both love it.  Use it mainly to see stuff on the ground or in the surrounding mountains haven't used it for star gazing.  Optics are very clear.
2,These might be good for use with a tripod but without it's nothing but shake city...they are virtually useless. The optics are poor AND We got another pair much smaller and much better quality optics that make these huge ones look like junk. NOT recommended
5,very clear. These are set 15 power. {power is not adjustable} You can focus the eye piece to your vision.
5,These are awesome for the amateur star watcher we were able to see Jupiter 's two moons a tripod is necessary to hold them still as they are heavy.
2,Binoculars arrived out of collimation.  If you actually try to look at stars you will have severe double image.  Apparently this is a common problem.
5,Very powerful. The glass lens are very clean and clear.
5,Great for the price binoculars. I only wish it woudl have a power adjustment but for teh price you can;t beat it!
2,The SkyMaster Binocuilars work ok for land objects but the sky/star gazing always shows double stars and I am unable to focus to one point of light. I suspect that the colimation is off internally perhaps it was dropped or banged up at some point.
1,Bought these a year ago and couldn't get these to work (seeing double) and gave up. In the back yard last night with my wife and I decide to try again. Of course they hadn't fixed themeselves. I thought maybe I wasn't adjusting correctly. Decided to do a search and there were many complaints. Gonna try to send these back to Celestron awaiting RMA.
5,fantastic with price.
3,The legs holder was missing
1,Not worth it
5,smooth operation in and out. thing look realy 3D through them. awsome.  this window wont close til I write 8 more words. done.
5,Very light weight for their size and bright clean clear optics.  Highly recommended for both star gazing and terrestrial use.
5,Great product good quality exceptional value makes it easy to locate objects in the night sky was able to find Andromeda on the first night out just by looking in the general area.
5,It's great for deepsky recon specially before using the telescope.Also consider getting a 10x50 for wider fields.Clear skies!
5,Bought this as a gift! My friend loves them and often tells me how much he enjoys them!
5,These are perfect for nature viewing....we keep in the car during road trips. Also great for ballgames and other sporting events
5,these are a great deal and amazing for star gazing these will be my go to choice!
5,Great value and they are light compared with an old used pair that I bought a long time ago.
5,These binoculars are by far the best value if you want to observe the sky at night. The views are awesome. The price excellent
5,Amazon always delivers what I want when I want it... Celestron's Skymaster 15x70 binocs are amazing.. The price was right too!
2,Product doesn't arrive in perfect condition collimation issues flimsy build and one eyepiece is always blur no matter how i turn whatever knob i can find.
2,Package size was much bigger as compared to the product. For that I had to pay 20 dollors extra. Its was 24" 24" 24" and more than 7 lbs.
5,Pretty cool to see the moon.  Haven't had a chance to drive anywhere dark to see more.
5,for me it is an excellent binocular very useful with tripod adapter especially for astronomy to enjoy the night sky
3,wish i bought a stronger pair
5,Great view !!
5,I can read a license plate at 200 yards easy. You can't beat it for the price...
5,No better value for the money. Can easily see Jupiter's moons and bands even without a tripod. I highly recommend these.
2,I was seeing double looking through these binos.  That gave me a headache.  I had to close one eye in order to see anything clearly.  They are not what I expected.  I returned them as a damaged item.
5,Very good value for the money. I like the fact it can be attached to a tripod.
5,Fantastic set of Bino's. Great for bird watching and star gazing. The eye relief is outstanding.
5,The best binoculars
5,I use these binocs for bird watching in my fields. Wonderful clarity. Easy to focus and the tripod adapter is perfect!
5,Have to use with tripod.  Can use at nite.  Well made.  Are heavy.  Good buy.
5,Somewhat heavy and strap is not that great.
5,The best binoculars for the money. Why you reading this? Put them in your cart now!
5,You will need a tripod (adapter included) !! otherwise lean on your back and have a sniper level shake free hand.
5,Super optics great field of view..Little heavy but OK. Would recommend for both casual & experienced stargazers. Great bargain and quality.
5,We bought this for a Christmas present for our son. He LOVES them!! A little pricy but well worth the money!
5,Have had the binoculars for several weeks and loving them. No problems so far. They are wonderful for moon/star gazing and wildlife watching. Great deal for the money.
3,nice but big and heavy
5,these were awesome I use them for birding and you could see nebula at night as well
5,A Little Heavy But well Worth It. I Saw A Good Ratings And I Will Concur The Same.The Clarity Is Great
5,Great binocs for the money a little heavy though
5,Very happy. Great value. Best used at home as these aren't particularly portable because of their size.
5,Gave them to my husband for Christmas and he loves them! They were just what he wanted!
5,Better optics than I was expecting.  The included tripod mount is too wobbly but metal ones are inexpensive.  Great binoculars!
3,nose heavy but powerful.
5,Awesome! More than I expected. I'd recommend! You'll be anxious for the next full Moon. Looked at Jupiter the other night.. Awesome!!
2,Good but fragile mine  broke. Plastic imagin..
5,Focus is amazing bit heavy for field work though.
5,Quallity of the binoculars is excelent. Easy to used and adjust. Magnifcation looks very clear.  bought them for an up coming trip.
5,I tried all the hunting stores in my arealooking for powerful binoculars.noone had anything over a 10/50 amazon came through again
5,I wanted something to look out the window of my condo with. These are perfect. Tripod highly recommended. Clear and nice.
5,Bit heavy but worth it's weight. Crisp view with enough lighting.
3,Ok
5,Loveeee these dont use em much but its nice to know i got great binos for this price.
5,these binoculars exceeded my expectations. the field of view is sharp. the only draw back is the tripod mount a little wobbly.
5,Red Notice: A True Story of High Finance...
2,I was hopefull about these but like other have reported my came misaligned and there is not built in way to adjust it. I was expecting more from Celestron but as they say live and learn.
5,Can see far away birds deer and other wildlife.  Even good for my grandson's baseball
5,Excellent clarity and sharpness!  A slight annoyance is the flimsy tripod adapter that twists and shakes easily.
5,For the price these things exceeded my expectations. Highly recommend for either day or night
5,Great Binoculars for the price. They can be hard to hold steady in your hands.
2,Hard to hold steady front end weight. Difficult to focus at distance. Heavy. Very difficult to use trying to follow and focus in on a moving object such as a power boat.
2,These work fine and would be 4 or 5 stars if they had not broke during the second use. Something inside the right lens obscures the view. These are basically worthless but worked well for the first 45 minute use.
5,Great binoculars for the price.  I would recommend using a tripod for astronomical viewing.
5,Good price great field. Checked out by others who know their optics and pronounced "very good".
2,Quality is kinda sub-par when comparing these with my Nikon brand which is kind of expected.... but I am already seeing double image out of these and have barely even used them - ya get what you pay for.
5,Great binocular for the price but since I ordered mine the price has dropped quite a lot.
5,I can't say enough positive tings about this fine set of binoculars which came well collimated. Its one instant where there should be no unpleasant surprises. Quality per dollar spent excels in every way.
5,My husband wanted these & he likes them a lot.
5,Very heavy to be able to easily use but can be really useful for casual star gazing!
3,big. fast shiping
5,they're big binocs but worth it. Great for birding!
5,Beautiful optics at fantastic price.
5,Celestron has been a leader in binoculars and telescopes for decades. The price was great and the quality is excellent.
2,Out of collimation out of the box. Returned. Purchased another new one with the same problem.
5,When the Four Horsemen ride down on their asteroid I will be able to ascertain who is holding the reins.
5,My dad loved these binoculars.  This ended up being a great gift!
5,I had purchased this product around couple of years ago. Very good build quality and superb magnifying.
5,Awesome! They are really clear and not heavy. Worth the money. Would recommend to anyone.
1,Sorry to say this was a bad experience. The binoculars produce a double picture when seeing through them and are therefore useless. I also wonder if they might be fake since there is no serial number or production number on them. I would have thought Celestron as the serious manufacturer they are would number their products...
3,not all that great
5,Really liking these binoculars. Really nice having them on my tripod as well...
5,Excellent product heavy because it is a big binocular but is really good for stars observation.
5,Really cool binoculars kinda hard to mount on a monopod
1,Unable to get a crisp image in both near and far distances even during a sunny day.  Perhaps I was sent a defective pair.  You get what you pay for I suppose.
2,I had a Celestron C8 telescope for many years that was truly amazing - unfortunately these binoculars were not - I returned them as they just would not focus clearly on an object - disappointing product experience.
2,These arrived bent so the two focal points don't line up. Yeah they're high-powered but unless you have crazy eyes that line up perfectly with how these are disaligned they're pretty much useless. I threw mine away.
3,Very good
1,Not good for anything.  Bad at looking at the stars.  Bad at looking at wildlife or your neighbors.  If you have a wide face then these will not open wide enough for you.  Poor quality which seems like a poor branding choice for Celestron.  Spend more money on something else.
5,Outstanding buy  I use them every night it's clear I highly recommend these binocculars.
5,I wanted binoculars that would allow viewing of the night sky as well as long distancescenery viewing. These binoculars are perfect.
5,Very good quality.  Exactly as advertised. I would recommend these.
5,One of best binoculars I ever had . Best value for money with tripod. One of must have item. Cheers!!
5,This was a gift for my husband he loves them. He uses them all the time!
2,I went through two pairs both of which arrived out of collimation. The images couldn't merge. Finally I got a cash refund and bought a pair for $40 more at Garret optical. They are super.
5,These are good quality product.  The lenses are strong and the view is spectacular when using them.  Would recommend this product.
2,A low end unit with very poor edge correction and transmission but perfectly good for terrestrial use. Not recommended for astronomy. Actualy a reasonable value for the (low) price just not a quality item.
5,adjustable lenses work very well
5,just what i wanted; good visibility and not too heavy to use without stand;
5,These binoculars show the whole world and they are especially fun for watching the birds in the backyard. And we got them quickly.
5,Great One! I bought them with discount so i paid a very low price. They are awesome!!
2,you get what you pay for.  not so good saw light artifacts in images they worked but images average at best.  other RAVE reviews are really exaggerated. these are cheapo but do work.
5,These are awesome binoculars and VERY powerful! Very high quality. And GREAT price!!!
5,Awesome. They are better than I expected. They are big-just keep that in mind. But these are excellent binocs. .
5,Great view clear and crisp easy to focus and zoom in. just wish that the case was a little stronger.
5,Just received them today and we've tested how they'll work.  They're as great as expected and we'll be pleased with this decision.
5,Great pair of binoculars!! Love them great price can't go wrong with a celestron product great optics.
5,Powerful bright good size. Quality. Probably best deal on hand-held manual optics. Ugly grip though.
3,Too heavy
1,I've had these binoculars for a couple months now and will admit that my 8x70 binoculars are alot better at viewing than these 15x70.Looking at San Francisco from across the bay the Images look pixilated and washed out.  Don't believe all of the positive hype about this binocular.Bottom line is you get what you pay for
5,Thay work good. But You need a stand
5,These binoculars are exactly what I was looking for. I needed them for a class I am taking. They work great.
5,For the price this is exactly what I was looking for. Inexpensive large powered star gazers. Save your money and get these.
5,Great product but very heavy to hold for long periods of time.
1,ok it was cheap i should have known.  saw the pic UK idiot put up and ASSUMED it was made in UK.  The TOXIC smell from the rubber eyepieces is enough to burn your eyes. what is the problem with chi plastic?  will use a few times and trash.
2,These are really hard to center the object. If you are slightly off you just see the side of the barrel.
5,Best Binoculars ever this is my first time buying check my youtube videohttp://youtu.be/OyrKoSOp4TI
5,very nice biggest i have ever had work great !!
5,These things work very good....
5,The scope is really powerful.  Very comfortable when holding in hand but really need a tripod for long time use.
5,Fun to pull out at ball game. People cant hardly believe the size. Good field of view for the night skys.
5,For the price you can't beat it
1,Sorry but the quality control is not there I have been through two pairs neither has been collimated properly. It is not user serviceable and it will not be many more pairs before I have spent more shipping them back to the manufacturer than I did on the item.
5,Powerful hanholdable if your not jittery well made.
5,nice view a little heavy through.
1,Poor quality optics but that's pretty much what I expected for the price.  The real problem is that after a few uses the attachment from the focal adjustment to the left lens came off tried fixing it but not successful.  Attractive price but bad value.  Stay away.
2,I returned these a few days after receiving them.  Can't explain it but the lenses were "off" and regardless of how it was focused there was a double image.  Disappointed.
1,collimation was way off had to send back. Did not get a new pair better off going to a store to buy them that is the only way to know if they will be correct.  If I was blind In one of my eyes they would have been great.
1,Celestron is better for watching games in the big stadium not recommended for sky watch.I hv tried to zooming moon using but it shows like a small light dot..lol.  And one more thing is  u need big mussels to hold it to the sky as it's too heavy.
5,I use it on my job daily and it is perfect. Very nice.
5,took'em for a camp ride and I was really impressed with'em you can see the world from the top of a mountain. anyway really impressed.
5,Convenient setup good night clarity and robust construction.
5,Purchased as a gift.  He picked this out and loves it.
5,For the price great value for money
5,Better than expected for price. Works well
5,I mounted these binoculars to a bogen photographic tripod and they work superbly for my Astronomy i do. I really pulled in things i couldn't with lesser binos( the plieades )for example.
5,So cool! I can see Jupiter.
1,I ordered 1 but ended up trying three because each one was broken. Each one given to me would not let me see straight unless I fadangled one of the scopes. I went with a Bushnell and was much happier.
1,I thought I could look at planes and skydivers better but the viewing area is so small you have to close one eye to see better and even then its not any closer then my 20x50 I have not tried the moon yet but not happy with this purchase.
2,Not suitable for Astronomy. Mine had a double image this is caused by the prisms not being aligned correctly very clear for day use though however I bought them for Astronomy.
5,I use a monopod while sitting in a stool fantastic views of the stars.
2,Difficult to not see two images and the focus is also difficult to grab and sharp image. Not happy with it.
5,super binocs with an unbeatable view. best binocs i've ever bought
5,Can't beat for the price. Wasn't expecting them to be as nice as they are.
3,OK but not as good as advertised.  More blurred vision around the outer sides than expected.
5,Celestron SkyMaster Giant 15x70 Binoculars with Tripod Adapter is very good. I have no any drawback with the Binoculars. I love it.
5,Very good binos recommend to anyone
2,Tried every adjustment possible but cannot eliminate the double vision. They are fine if you close one eye.
5,These are really powerful and really clear they are the best entry level glasses I have even come across. Buy These!
5,Buy this binoculars. For the money you pay you get a whole lot more. Get a good tri-pod. Enjoy. It is heavy.
2,FAST SHIPPING  HAVE THEM ON MY BOAT . HAVE TO CLOSE ONE EYE TO SEE ANYTHING AND NOT REAL CLEAR. NOT A GOOD FIT ON A BOAT .
5,What a wonderfull binoculars  it worth the price  can believe that such product is so cheap an very reliable
1,Very disappointed with these scopes. Firstly the rubber padding on both grips peeled off within minutes of being removed from the box. Secondly the tri-pod attachment is substandard. Lastly the performance was adequate at best. Maybe I just got a bad pair but I would stay away.
1,Cheap price but bad quality. Very heavy also. You have to use tripod to keep it balance.
5,Large field of view. manageable weight. Reasonable price. Well packaged. Plenty of light transfer. A very good company name. Satisfied.
5,Highly recommended for clear sky and nature views. Great product with a great price..
1,Mine was broken from middle knob in one month.  Binacular is very powerfull and it shows you everything clear. It is not heavy but made of low quality material. It was waster of $86 now one month is passed and I cant return it :(
5,amazing product. I would pay double to replace if I ever lost mine.
2,We returned them.  They are very heavy you can't hold them still for any length of time.  The word Tripod Adapter is the clue word.
5,Strong and remarkably clear for a inexpensive unit.
5,Awesome field glasses at a great price.  Adapter for a tripod unckuded.
5,These binoculars are great and the price was very reasonable. I will get many years of enjoyment out of this item.
5,Good binos better price.
1,double vision when looking through.  I would not recommend this.  Very dissatisfied that I had only a few weeks to return an item after the holidays.  Now I'm stuck with something that was expensive and doesn't work.  Shame on you Amazon!
5,excellent we  stocked our oceanfront condos with these for whale watching
5,I ended up giving this to a friend who really likes it. Great gift idea
5,Great picture!
5,These things are awesome but a bit heavy.  We've star gazed and beached watched.
5,Great product.  Super clear images.
5,Amazing! (Need tripod)
1,Received  them brand  new right out of the box looked at a jet in the sky and o is that 2 jets no its a double  image! !!!!!! Don't  they check these thing before  they ship them from the manufacturer.
5,Amazingly clear and close for $65. It is a pretty heavy binoc consider a tripod.
1,Can't use them at all. Don't know what happened but used to be ok. Now getting double vision.
5,Like em a lot
2,Great condition packaging no problem--weight not mentioned for this item--much too heavy to carry or hold for very long. I'm trying another kind that says lightweight.
5,If you want to see the moon and globulars this is your choice.I watch the sky for several years and love this one.Only remember that it is a bit heavy.
1,The reviews for these seem to be either excellent or terrible apparently depending on the luck of the draw.  Mine had collimation error and the optics were very fuzzy.  Too bad it seems if you get a good pair they are great.
1,Horrible product.  The lens fell out right out of the box and the clarity of these are very poor.  I would NOT recommend purchasing these.  I am very disappointed in them and wish I had returned them.  Waste of money!!!
5,Great product for the price
5,Pros:  Great Price Great ProductCons:  The tripod adapter could be better (does the job but allows for some shake)
2,Not for me. I cant see the planets. Very disappointed. I have also other binoculars  but I cant really see the stars or planets.
2,not much detail seen thru these when star gazing or looking at the moon.  Just a regular pair of binoculars imo
5,Very satisfied fast delivering and great binocularsLove it
5,Works great! Easy to focus has some weight (as described) but an excellent product.
5,very large but ok for the price
5,Heavier and not as portable as I would like but WOW these are awesome!
5,Great binoculars ! They are so clear and sharp. Wonderful price. Just what I wanted.
1,I ordered this item and it came defective...lenses were out of alignment...I have sent the item back and waiting for replacement. I somehow felt that they sent was not new...the packing didn't look new...I will update my comments once i receive the replacement.
5,Great for viewing stars.  Can really see moons around Jupiter and Orion Nebulae.  Easy to use and good value. Great purchase
5,Awesome I've never seen the moon with so much detail
5,So much fun to use for star gazing!
1,Not usable due to ghost images around high contrast objects during daytime observation and multiple reflections of a star along a cross with the real star in the center  makes it useless for astronomical observations as well. Fortunately Amazon makes the return possible.
1,I bought a Celestron - SkyMaster Giant 15x70 glasses and sent me a book
5,The binoculars are very nice for the price. I was quite surprised how big and how far I could see with the binoculars
5,excellent product.  great price.  My husband is very happy with his present.
1,This is ver big and heavy and its not worth to buy it will take lot of time to adjust and you will need tripod for sure its better we buy auto focus with same range its easy to carry and use.
2,went wrong focus control.I had to repair it.The binoculars have good gain but are heavy and difficult to focus at a distance.
5,As stated by other reviewers. Good value easy to use and great for viewing.
1,Miscalibrayed during manufacturing or damaged during shipping. Images are double vision. Iâve tried them and had someone with a larger eye spread try them. Same result. Unusable.
5,Work great for star eatching
5,Great Deal on Very good product!
5,Good quality good image they are quite big and heavy but they feel pro
2,The left side has trash inside it and you see spotted. The rubber on the metal parts is sticky.
1,Seeing double as is everyone else it seems.  Even after I pull the rubber back and re-align manually just a short ride in the car gets them out again.  Horrible product buy something better.
5,great binocs. still use
2,Had been dropped or were simply terrible quality. The eyepieces saw two different views. It superimposed a ghost image above the other image.
1,Since day one they are either sharp or clear. I tried to play with the screw for collimation with no positive results. Overall a waste of money...
5,Amazing!!!!
1,The optics were fuzzy and objects had a ghost shadow (I don't know what else to call it) around them. I suppose they could have been knocked out of adjustment by UPS as it was drop kicked may times I'm sure.
5,WOW!  If you want to see the moon these are wonderful!!!
2,Not reach long distances not recommended
5,Great Binoculars for star gazing
5,good
2,Poor construction.  Prisms were loose and rattling around when we received the binoculars.  The return and credit went very well.
2,Collimation is off upon arrival.....there is no way to adjust without destroying the grips. Disappointed. Guess I'll be contacting the manufacturer.
2,They were way to heavy for me to use.  Because of their weight I will probably use them very seldom.
2,Had to return it had missing parts the eye cover was missing a a a a a a  a a
2,This is too heavy for everyday use. It's perhaps good for long observation using a tripod. Not for a casual use.
5,I love these binoculars  best I ever had.
2,I really wanted a binocular with more power for closenes of far objects with no experience I made the wrong choice.
2,The lenses needed adjustment and there were ghosts/double images. My 8x walmart binoculors were better than this expensive piece of equipment
5,They are simply awesome.
1,Disappointed with the Celestron SkyMaster. Ended up returning them. I was expecting to be wowed by these but it didn't happen. Not as heavy as some suggest but I wouldn't bother getting them. Opt for a good telescope instead.
1,The first time I picked them up the eye pieces fell off in my hand. With only a one page manual there are no instructions on how to re-install them. Made in China big surprise. I returned them for refund.
5,Just wanted to say the Celestron SkyMaster 15x70 binoculars are great. Powerful enough for stargazing or for whatever objects you want to look at. Great Value!
1,It's impossible to bring items into focus without closing one eye which defeats the purpose of these.  Everyone I've showed these to has the same problem.  Really disappointed as the return window period has now just expired.
1,umm no. magnification was decent but could not get a clear view of anything but planes that flew into scope...also very bouncy poor stability. dissapointed. Im no astronomer but these did not help me in my pursuit of stargazing.
5,Great binoculars..
5,great
1,Was looking for a decent set of binoculars.  Based on the price I thought these would be.  They are heavy bulky and frankly not very effective.  I will do more research before I purchase another pair.
5,Excellent product at a great price. The views of the moon are breathtaking.
2,They were broken had to send them back
1,The tripod adapter was not a part of the package as promised and I find that very amusing!! Since the adapter is part of the standard binoculars it seems like it has been deliberately separated for whatever reasons!!
5,These rule...worth the money
1,It is clear but can only be adjusted in a limited degree. I might have shorter pupil distance I can't see the two lens cone in an identical circle and always see some black edges block my view.
2,Binoculars are very sturdy mine was missing the tripod mount thats the only reason why im giving it 2 stars
2,It came without the tripod adapter that I needed to use it.  I returned it for that reason only.
5,I borrowed one once and admired its qualities. It was a bargain.
5,Highly recommended for stargazing.
5,excellent!
5,xmas gift
5,very nice great quality
5,incredible approach ... good very good product .. I recommend ..
5,love the binoculars.
5,over the moon âº
5,Excellent Handy. Quick!  better than moving my 8" for something like ISS
2,No mount and cannot hold steadying enough to use.
5,it is very good for out door life. I like out door activity.
5,Awesome binoculars in excellent condition!! I am very happy.
5,As expected
5,it's amazing!!! i recommend it for astronomy and birding trip
5,Views are very clear and you can adjust them very easily!
5,A great deal! I've priced others that were twice the price.
5,just what i expected and wanted
2,Not so great I paid 5$ for a pair at local store and they are better disappointed.
2,No tripod adapter contained
5,Excellent
1,I'm going to return them - they aren't clear - it feels like you have a stigma when you look through them.  I'm going with Nikon next time.
5,A very good value. I was impressed with the quality of these binoculars at such a low price.  I highly recommend this product.
1,Unable to focus them properly despite following directions both on package insert and various websites.  Red and blue rays of color stream out from whatever I'm attempting to focus upon.  Frustrating.  Returning them asap.
5,Larger and heavier than I excepted but they perform well.
5,Awesome!
1,Just too shaky to hold still. Double-vision as well. Something is not aligned properly. Tried two both had double vision.
5,Far better than what I expected especially for the cost.
1,From the start the tracking number of the package never gave any progress after it was shipped.The track and trace system did not recognized the given number. Its seems that I am scammed.
2,Very heavy and unstable! Cannot be used with children. You will need a very sturdy stand!
5,Very satisfied I can see why they were given such high reviews.
1,way to bulky iam sending it back.  would not recommed it.  price is good but not the product.  youll just send it back as Iam going to. Pain in the butt
5,These are great. Easy to use versatile great product for the price.
5,Shipping speedViews very very ExcellentEspecially for lovers of Space
2,Didnt focus well returned it. Went with BigBinoculars LW
5,Great product and very helpful!
5,Very accurate & clear. Great clarity for bird watching at a distance!
5,Love this purchase! I can see everything!
5,It's good!!
2,Wasn't impressed with these at all.  Could never get them to focus correctly.
5,Big and heavy but very bright.
5,Terrific. Gave as a gift and was loved.
1,My particular example of this product wasn't usable.  Three of us tried to use the binoculars and none of us could get anything other than double vision out of the experience.
2,Tripod adaptor broke the first time I tried to connect it to the tripod.
5,Gave as wedding gift with tripod and they loved it.
1,Optics were out of alignment right out of the box gave me a headache just looking through the lenses.  Focus had nothing to do with it I was seeing everything double.
5,Great binoculars could just barely make out the rings of Saturn
5,Absolutely fantastic.
2,Was not what I was hoping for smaller binoculars worked just as well.
5,Really good stuff.
5,excellent
5,purchased them for my daughter she likes them a lot!
1,It is such a waste of money spent very difficult for beginners.
5,The best binoculars I've owned.
2,Not usable by a person with eyes that are not close together
2,Does not have the sharp clarity i expected with the 70mm lens.
5,Great for the price.  Advise getting a tripod.
1,This product does not work well.  I suggest buying this type of product in store and not on line.  Very disappointed in the product and would not recommend.
1,What was in focus was ok but constantly had double vision with them no matter how much you play around with them. Not worth the time or money. Returned item
5,Works better than expected from reviews I had read.
5,Surprising HIGH QULAITY for the low buck investment... EXCELLENT Binocs!
1,has an scratch on the inside of lens.  bought it end of December  and just now am getting a chance to use it and notice this inside scratch
2,Optics had issue with color for right eye. Made it unusable
2,Don't purchase. You get what you pay for. Nebula my ass.
5,Very good magnification. Quite heavy. Best with a tripod. Good deal.
5,They are great! What a good deal!
5,Very nice set of Binoculars good quality I recomend them.
5,I can see everything with these things.EVERYTHING.
1,I'm disappointed with this product because it comes uncalibrated and is difficult to do so.still trying to find a place to calibrate.collecting dust since the day i bought it!
1,It says it has a inferred feature but nothing in the manual or way to turn that on or off.  I don't get it better call the maker.
5,I wish I had this Binocular sooner it works well for star watching or bird watching etc.Easy to mount on a tripod.
2,These work great but they are HUGE and very heavy.
5,My whole family enjoys using these several times a week.
5,Good product but definately need a Tripod to use this....
5,really cool
5,great quality for the price
1,Second set of these to be sent back for not being collimated properly. I'm disappointed in celestron. I expected better.
5,Great product and will purchase from again. Thank you!
5,Wonderful bino's for the price. You will spend as much if not more for a sturdy tripod. A tripod should be rated for at least 11 lbs. Higher magnification and weight makes a tripod neccessary.
1,"Refurbished" piece of junk. Nothing refurbished about them - they weren't collimated so your eyes are looking at different places.
5,These are big heavy binocs. Get a tripod (any sturdy tripod will do). Awesome views that rival 5" telescopes costing a lot more.
1,No longer work.  Less than 10 hors of use.  Company mot willing to replace.
5,Very nice for casual viewing. Tripod is recommended
5,nice for the price.  suits my needs.
1,They came terribly out of collimation. So much so that they were unusable.
5,Very big but you can see everything. (Hunting Use)
1,Garbage - don't buy - unless you want to see 2 of everything
5,Compared to the binoculars we replaced this pair is great.
1,out of focus you see everything doubled!... How can amazon sell these products that don't work I feel like I should sue somebody.. don't buy these binoculars!
5,GRRREEEEAAATTT!!!! i know some people who have $500 and up binoculars and these are just as clear and good if not better!Very good buy :D
5,Excelent product. Fast delivery. Just what I was expecting for.
5,Perfect.  Exactly what I thought I ordered.
2,returned for collimation issues one side way off
1,Terrible optics alignment and leads to double vision. Also the product is very heavy.
2,Fair quality. Two lens won't focus together returned.
5,These are absolutely enormous. they work really well though.
1,We ordered these binocs after reading the reviews and hoped the optics would be good.  However the allignment is off--we see double of everything.  Returning for another pair....
2,Too heavy too big for casual use.
1,Follow instructions of how to set them up but I could not focused the binoculars. All I saw was double images when looking with both eyes.
2,Collamination is a problem.  Really useless.
5,excellent product for the price highly recommended.
5,Solid and crystal clear really liked it
2,hard to focus and I've returned it.
2,It's was just could meet d expectations
5,Yep!!!
1,Returned these could have received a bad pair?.. I was very unhappy with the focus at any settings. Should have tried another pair?.. I tried another brand instead.
5,fantastic buy they are heavy but worth it
5,love themeverything is clear. Very happy we bought them!
1,I couldn't get it to focus.  It's very heavy.  If I hadn't thrown away the box I would have returned it.  It was very disappointing.
5,We love these binoculars. Fun to star gaze with.
5,Great binoculars. Well made and easy to use
5,dose what I want it to very well.
2,They are really big and heavy
5,Awesome binoculars. Very clear and can see forever.
5,Larger than I expected but very good quality product.
5,Must have for night star gazing.
1,My first comment was wrong. sorry
5,I don't know the difference between $80.00 and more expensive binos but these give a very clear view of stars at night and I am very happy with them.
2,Very heavy to hold.
2,Saw double not in adjustment
5,Haven't used tripod adapter but the binoculars are very good!
1,Product is defective lens is damaged unable to focus.  Image is split in two horizontally.  I will never again buy from Amazon "Warehouse Deals"
1,The binocs are out of colimation out of the box. Must be returned to the factory to be repaired. Still unable to use.
5,Great binoculars!Awesome customer service.  Thank you!
5,Outstanding optic
1,Junk you get what you pay for... They are hazy when looking through most of the ranges and distances ... oh well
5,Nice product for the money.
1,I'm seeing double out of them spend a little more and get better. Should have retuned but thought I was doing something wrong.
5,this is really good binoculars for this price ;)
1,Came totally misaligned such that the two images were vertically offset. Unusable. I'll update this review when the replacement arrives...
1,Although I tried numerous times I wasn't able to get it to focus correctly.  What a waste of time and money.  I wouldn't recommend these to anyone.
5,Great for star gazing
1,This used pair of binoculars arrived damaged. Images did not align and as this is not something that can be easily fixed we had to return them.
5,For the money well worth it. sharp optics
5,Best pair of binocular I have ever had.
5,love them very clear.
5,Excellent quality and very good price.
4,My husband received the 15x70 Skymaster binos as a Christmas gift.  They arrived well packaged protected and in perfect collimation out of the box.  Using them with a tripod or braced against something is almost necessary for more than just a few minutes of viewing time as the weight will cause fatigue in your arms and lead to shaky views.  He loves everything about them but said the included neck strap was a huge disappointment which is why we are giving them a 4 star rating.  It is just a small 3/8" wide nylon web strap that really starts digging into your neck after just a few short minutes.  We've ordered a wider padded strap for better comfort.  He's had cheaper smaller binos that come with a much better strap than what these included.  Celestron should have included a better strap considering the weight.
5,Wonderful and a great deal.  But they MUST be on a stable tripod.  Make your own holder DIY.These are almost as good as my 8" DOB.
5,Those r tops!
1,Arrived seeing doubles.  Attempted to collimate to no avail.  Poorly constructed.  Left tube mounted improperly.  Poor quality control.
2,Not strong enough!
5,Good binoculars! They appear to be very well made.
5,Use this at the range to 100 yards.
5,Very powerful best used with a tripod.
1,They were broken when we took them out of the package. This was a waste of money we won't be buying again. Just wish we could get our money back.
5,Great product.

1,I received it wthout a tripod adaptor.
1,QUALITY REALLY WENT DOWN FROM A FEW YEARS AGO !!!
1,They have double vision. Do not recommend these
5,none
5,Excellent
5,I received these as a gift and got to test them out right away.  They are big and a little heavy but wow they do a great job.  My brother was in town and testing out his telescope and we were checking out Jupiter and its moons.  I wondered if I could see what he saw and low and behold I could clearly make out at least 3 of Jupiter's many moons.  With his telescope you could barely make out some features on the planet itself but you could also see 5 moons.  So I'm not sure how much was spent on his setup but I was pretty satisfied that I could see that far.  I'm waiting to see if I can make out the rings on Saturn but I'm assuming I will be able to.  I also want to get a tripod for longer views and maybe a cellphone adapter.  Overall I'm very pleased with the binoculars!
1,Poor opticals. Severe collimation issue.
5,my son really enjoys his binoculars.  he is having a great time with this product.these were really worth the price.great purchase!
1,Sent them back! CAN MAKE YOUR VISION GO BONKERS
1,Double vision just like others warned about.
1,returned because it was defective  cost me $12

Very very good condition I received it. Alignment is perfect no collimation is needed. Contrary to one person's review saying "...that the center focusing mechanism tends to drift and requires constant attention." I beg to differ on that I find everything is perfectly adjusted and pretty stiff which is great.In layman's term I'll write my review:Exact weight of the binoculars with caps and strap attached is 3 pounds 1 ounce.Using the binoculars at approx 40 feet distance will max out the "focus" not "zoom in" to get the clearest image. That is the closest object viewing as you can use it.Looking from the furthest point lets say at the moon will let you "focus" not "zoom" to a point where the image is clear as you can get but still do have more adjustments for further objects. So I trust I explained it a very simple way for others to understand.This binoculars has no zoom in or out what it does have is the focusing knob to adjust for eyesight.Watching the full Moon on Friday June 13 2014 approx 7:40 P:M I was amazed at all the stuff you can see on the moon which is not visible with the eye. I can easily see craters but not in details. The best way to see the craters especially with a full moon is to look at the right side edge of the moon that will definitely show some craters easily.At approx 15 miles away I can clearly see a telecommunications tower with its dishes and antennas. I can also see a large red roof building at the same distance not far from the communications tower. At approx quarter mile away I can clearly see a sign with it letters which is not visible by my eyesight but the sign board is visible to my eyesight. That said I'll consider this binoculars a real little beast.My eyesight is very good at spotting things in the distance I'm 20-20 with my vision. So I have a pretty good eyesight. During the daytime I was scouting around the horizons around my home (I have a great view of our southern and central range and other places of interest) and noticed a place I always look at I took the binoculars and was really surprised at seeing people that I could not see under normal circumstances even birds flying in the distance which I could not see. I own a pair of Zenith binoculars for many years but never saw so much details like what I see with this Celestron binoculars.I have a lightweight Samsonite 1100 tripod which I use to setup my new Celestron Binoculars (its broken at the top and I did some modifications so I can use it for the binoculars). I also use my tripod like a monopod (unipod) pull up two legs and leave one leg fully extended for balancing the weight of the binoculars. The tripod adapter that came with the binoculars works great on the tripod. I do intend to purchase another heavy duty tripod in the near future just for the binoculars. Thank you Amazon.
1,Sent them back because of misalignment of the oculars.
1,Returned
1,they really are GIANT!
1,no quality control
5,These are great easyer than dragging out the telescope.. but to take full advantage of them should have a tripod..
5,Very good quality easy to use/handle crisp clear optics.  We really like these.  Highly recommended.
5,TL;DR version: Amazing views amazing value!Let me preface this review by admitting I may not be the ideal binocular user.  My eyes cross easily (or focus on close objects easily) but are slow to recover from it.  When eyepieces get near my eyes they water.  Since receiving them I learned that when I'm tired I have an even tougher time merging the images from each eye when looking through binoculars and it's even more difficult to get the focus set right.After some serious research on my part my wife purchased three sets of binoculars (for less than a hundred dollars total!) for me and the kids:Celestron SkyMaster Giant 15x70Celestron Cometron 7x50Celestron UpClose G2 8x21As a plus I was able to compare the views in all three to figure out whether any issues were due to the hardware or my wetware.  See the attached side-by-side photo for a size comparison and my reviews on the other two items for more detail.- - - -My SkyMaster Giant 15x70 came in a large plain double-thick cardboard box that fit perfectly around the "retail box" with the Celestron logo and pretty background and such.  Inside the box is a plastic-wrapped soft carrying case with a bit of the squishy pink foam around the eyepieces and inside the bag are the plastic-wrapped binoculars with more pink foam surrounding the tripod adapter.  I'm planning on handholding these and don't have any interest in the adapter so I have no comment on it.Having limited experience with astronomy I was a little concerned that things wouldn't look as bright through these as they would through the 7x50s since the exit pupil isn't as large (50/7 versus 70/15).  This is not so.  Everything is brighter through these to the point where I'm almost afraid to look at the Moon for fear of hurting my eyes from the brightness.  I'm not sure if this is due to the larger objective lenses or the BaK-4 prisms in these versus the BK7s in the 7x50s but after looking through these I honestly don't know if I can be satisfied with lower magnification or smaller objective lenses.A bit about handholding these things: I'm tall but let's just say I won't be spontaneously entering any weightlifting competitions anytime soon.  Muscle shirts are loose around my arms.  I lift my kids and the occasional heavy item but I haven't seen the inside of a gym for oh a solid decade now.  You get the idea.  But even so I had little trouble handholding these.  With my elbows braced on top of my backyard privacy fence (as I said I'm tall) I saw the four Galilean moons lined up in a perfect little row around Jupiter.  Lying flat on my back I had excellent views of the Pleiades though the sky wasn't super clear so the Andromeda Galaxy was disappointingly faint.  With my elbows pinched inward and resting on my torso the Orion Nebula looked incredible.Yeah my arms got tired but the awesome thing about backyard stargazing with binoculars is that there's no set up at all.  I get tired I go inside for a little bit and study the sky (I use the awesome free and open source software called Stellarium) and try to pick my next targets.They looked amazing most of the time but at the very end of my viewing sessions some 3+ hours later I had trouble with some blurriness and double vision.  The collimation may be slightly off on these or maybe my arms were too tired or like I said my visual wetware is just not ideal for binoculars.  Not sure but I enjoyed them so much before that so I can't knock off a star for what might just be me being tired.In short I'm very very pleased with these binoculars.  I can't wait for clear skies again.
5,I gave these as a gift last year. Just got some for myself. These are really nice.
5,Very good quality. Got for stargazing and they work great!!
5,Great binoculars. Have had no problimes at all.
4,The SkyMaster line is great.  These are heavy binoculars and require a tripod.  Because they are binoculars and not a scope with an angled eyepiece the Celestron tripod is far too short for comfortable viewing.  Amazon please do not pair these two products!Another nit:  The SkyMaster mount where the binoculars meet the tripod is of too small a diameter especially since the receiving surface on most tripods is rubber or other material with some "give".  This can result in the binoculars being unstable unless the binocular mounting screw is torqued hard into the tripod mounting surface.  Inadequate design.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                Â After reading so many reviews I made a decision on taking the risk and buying this Binos (Celestron  skymaster 15x70) the most common issue everyone complains about itâs collimation... which I didnât even know what it meant lol... Iâm very new at this...  but I also found plenty of videos on what it meant and how to fix it. I didnât have a big budget so I went for it... Iâm sooooo happy that my Binos came working perfectly from the moment I got them out of the box... again Iâm new at this but I did a lot of research... Iâm not sure how super more expensive Binos will work but this Binos for an amateur astronomer but that also does her homework and wants the best of what a little restricted budget can have they have so far super exceeded my expectations... I got to see for  about 30secs the ISS with some detail... if you want to do that get the NASA App... also very good details on the moon... even thou I have not really been able to use them on a real clear night... Iâm posting a video that will show (not as clear as what I see) how powerful this Binos are. Iâm a real ordinary person that really bought this binoculars Iâm just so freaking happy with them that I know I sound like Iâm trying to sell them...  anyways do your research educate yourself  with all the different terms and things about binoculars... itâs not as a simple as you might think but if you do your homework youâll have an awesome experience... one more thing... they are not that heavy but if you want to really get a good view get a good tripod ;)
5,I purchased this to check out the full moon. I totally love it. I am now a beginner birdwatcher too. I do see the moon so very close.  It is a bit heavy and if you are not used to it your hands will shake. So worth the purchase.
5,Very bright and clear image.  I have used these mounted on a tripod too.  I can see all 4 Galilean moons!  As long as you are careful with the included adapter it should not break.
5,I purchased these binoculars for night sky viewing.  I had a pair of 10X50 Bushnell binoculars and I was impressed with what I was able to see through those so I bought these for even more in depth viewing and they have not let me down.  They are ideal as supplements to a telescope or if you don't have a telescope these are great for your first introduction to optics that will open up the night sky to you.  They are much easier to use than a telescope and you can see all kinds of neat things.  I viewed such things as the Orion Nebula the Andromeda galaxy the Pleiades and double stars such as Mizar and Alcor in Ursa Major with relative ease and they looked stunning.  Focus these binoculars in on the Milky Way and you will see tons of stars you wouldn't be able to see otherwise.  I was even able to look at Saturn and with some steadying of the binoculars against my chest could slightly make out the definition of the rings.  These binoculars also do a magnificent job of viewing the moon.I had read some reviews that they are really heavy and bulky but I found that they were surprisingly light and easy to steady free handed.  They are quite large which means that they will take up more space than a normal binocular but this is to be expected.  Mine did come with a carrying case and a tripod adapter (which I haven't used yet so I cannot comment on its quality).Overall for the price you can't go wrong.  I've used these binoculars in the daytime and they are great--crystal clear optics.  They also seem very durable and with some care will probably last you many many years.  If you are new to stargazing and are considering a good pair of binoculars that will show you all kinds of wonderous things look no further than the Celestron Skymasters--you will not be disappointed.
3,I ordered 8 of these for my astronomy class.  Of the original 8 3 were out of collimation.  I sent those back and of the 3 new ones I received 1 was out of collimation.  I sent those back but Amazon was unwilling to send me another pair i just got a refund.  So I will have to reorder the last pair.  These are good binos when you get a well-collimated pair but you have to be willing to test them.  The tripod adapter is crap however.  I will have to buy replacements that help dampen the oscillation faster.  But overall I like these binos and my students are impressed when they use them.
5,Just as described by seller.  No adjustments needed.  Much improved over my old 10X50s.
4,I bought this for my husband and though is likes the range of this thing; it seems it is really heavy to hold in hands; so a tripod is must. The range is good though if you are thinking to watch stars; look somewhere else; perhaps a telescope. We tried watching mars some weeks back and though we could spot it; it was not really great feel.We have a tripod now; and this thing comes with the hook to mount it; it is mounted well and works much better now.We still are not sure what to do with this as we mainly bought this for star gazing and it seems not so useful for that.
5,We got these for our son who is 12 and we were more than happy with the clarity and easy to use binoculars! We looked at Saturn moon  and stars amazing! Would buy again definitely!!
3,I got this for a gift a few years back. It came well collimated but after time it had gone out pretty bad (image in the left and right eye no longer converge). I hear this is due to drying putty which means most of these will go out of collimation after a few years and paying for collimation costs more than the binoculars themselves.For the longest time I just used one side and left the other side cappedâwhich means that I'm essentially just using it as a spotting scope. Today I got brave enough to cut away the correct portions of the grip on the side I never use (nothing to lose) and tired adjusting collimation myself. I have the image converged but something else isn't aligned right so  I'm not getting as much light in the edge as I should. I'm in a better place than where I was at but anymore work on this is not worth the effort.If you are fine using it as a monocular spotting scope it is quite nice. I've viewed the Jupiter and its moons many times (though don't expect to resolve any surface features) Saturn (which looked like an oblong spec to my eyes but could not resolve any ring gaps) the Moon satellites and even Ceresâall from my brightly lit suburban driveway.That being said maybe it would be better to spend the money on a better quality spotting scope (that has an angled eyepiece!) for the same price. You'll be able to use it on higher parts of the sky and could get more bang for your buck by spending a little more.
4,As a beginner happy with purchase. Set up is easy and very simple.The tripod adapter coming with this not a good quality. It is not holding it tightly even after you tried a lot to tight it.
5,I bought this as a gift for my husband and he loves it.  We were able to see the moon and stars.  Definitely a great product for sky watchers.
5,These are my first binocs and theyâre really nice. Really sharp central focus at long distances brings the birds to me. I do notice a little softening around the edges nothing too distracting. They are a little heavy for extended handheld use but holding them further out on the barrels adds stability. I use them mounted on a tripod mostly another great feature.
5,Wow! These nocs are incredible for star-gazing. There is so much to see out there that ordinary field glasses aren't cut out for. I am so glad they come with the tripod mount otherwise there is no way you can hold them steady enough to see what is going on. The pupil size is just perfect for the dark-adjusted eyeball letting in the most light it possibly can without the glare effect of other binos. They're heavy but not so much that you can't easily move them around on a tripod. And the lens quality is spectacular... clear crisp and bright. Definitely worth the pricetag!
5,OK.  I'm a VERY beginner astronomy enthusiast and I have read review after review that said "START WITH A GOOD PAIR OF BINOCULARS [instead of sinking money in a costly telescope because you're likely going to waste money with your inexperience]."  I took that advice and how can I not at this price point?  There was no "risk."The very first 10 minutes of using these things I was able to see the moon in stunning detail.  The craters look like something out of a National Geographic image.  The Sea of Tranquility is beautiful through these things---you can just imagine Neil Armstrong landing within it---almost hypnotic.  I was also immediately able to find and see the moons of Jupiter (there is no way you can see these with your naked eyes---Jupiter is just too bright) and the Seven Sisters star cluster (AKA The Pleiades AKA Messier object 45)---my very first Messier object.When I went 30 minutes east into the local mountains (of a 1 Million+ population center) with these I was excited and stunned to actually see the "cloud" of the Orion Nebula stick out so prominently with these things. The Orion nebula is actually so significant and visible through these things that it will catch your eye simply by (clumsily) scanning the sky.All in all an amazing value for the beginner astronomer.  Some advice: use the tripod adapter (and a tripod!) as it is difficult to hold steady (and you'll miss out on little details like there are actually several more than seven stars in Seven Sister cluster or Jupiter has several "huge" moons and some of their orbits are surprisingly far away from the planet.To take it to the "next level" with this new "affliction" I'm going to invest in a beginner's astronomy book/sky chart.  Up until now I have been using the Web and the Google Sky Map app on my Android (both of which are not very useful in the back country) to locate stars and deep space objects.  Maybe someday soon I'll graduate to a "real" telescope but I just can't recommend these things enough for the power simplicity (the field of view is so wide and "forgiving") portability quality/sturdiness/solid feel and PRICE(!)---how do they make any money with these things?!BTW I rarely write reviews.  I just wanted to let all of you know that this is a TRUE NO-BRAINER VALUE!  Cheers!
5,I got these binocs and the Vanguard aluminium binoc tripod adapter (I didn't even consider using the plastic adapter provided) to use as astro spotters for my DSLR tracking mount.  First light was tonight.  In preparation this afternoon I got the eyepieces set for my eye differences (I wear glasses and have a slight astigmatism) and I added the tripod adapter (it went on easily) and then I added the setup to a monopod with a pistol grip ball head mount.  I spent some time looking around the neighborhood and I was quite impressed with the resolution and no collimation error.  Tonight I took the setup out and I observed Jupiter with Io Europa Ganymede and Callisto hanging down like a string of pearls - quite a special view sorry my mount and camera was inside all packed up.  I then swiveled over to the Orion Nebula and it looked great.  I poked around for a bit and ended up with the Pleiades filling the FOV.  Were they a little fuzzy out at the very edges of the FOV? - Yes.  A big deal? - No.  Can these binoculars split a double? - Maybe on a tripod or with a parallelogram mount with great seeing.  But for $60 these binocs are an incredible deal; I could not be happier with my purchase.  I thought I was just getting some spotting gear for my DSLR work; instead I got a "grab and go" setup I can leave in the car and not worry about or toss in my luggage for some out of town observing.  This gear with a decent tripod mount and pistol grip ball head on a monopod is so easy to use you'll need a really big excuse not to head out and do some viewing.
3,These are still $50 binos selling for $90-100 now. Silicone coating on aluminum sections becomes sticky and eye cups degrade a bit in only a couple years.Very clear when collimated but no uv lens coating.If approaching $100 I expect the improvements.
5,these are heavy but the quality is there. fairly easy to focus yet not as good as a telescope... you cant see really close
5,HELLO THERE I AM A BINOFANATIC  I BOUGHT THESE BECAUSE I WANTED POWER SINCE I LIVE IN A 3 STORY HOME OVER LOOKING THE LAS VEGAS STRIP ABOUT 6 MILES OUT.... I CAN MAKE OUT  A  BILLBOARD READING 2 BIG MACS FOR 5.00 AT 4.1 MILES FROM MY BEDROOM WINDOW...... PLANES LANDING AND DEPARTING AT 12-15 MILES FROM MY WINDOW....... YOU WILL SEE THINGS YOU WONT SEE WITH THE NAKED EYE... I ALSO HAVE THE 20 X 80 AND I HAVE ON ORDER 25 X 70 .......... I HAVE A NICE PAIR OF NIKON ACULON 10 X 50 & NIKON ACTION 12 X 50 GREAT QUAILTY FROM NIKON AS YOU MAY KNOW..... AND I TELL YOU WHAT THE SKYMASTER COMPETES WITH THEM ALL AND IS THE PAIR OF BINO'S  I USE THE MOST..... I WAS NEVOUSE WHEN I ORDED THEM BECAUSE OF SHIPPING AND HANDLEING....SO TRUST ME ORDER THESE BAD BOYS AND YOU WILL HAVE A TON OF FUN. ALSO ALWAYS REMEMBER WITH ANY BINOS YOU HAVE TO TUNE THEM IN FOR THE BEST CRYSTAL CLEAR VIEW..... READ AND FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS...VERY IMPORTANT SHOULD TAKE ABOUT 3-5 MINUTES TO TUNE THEM IN TO YOUR EYES.... PLAN TO BUY ANOTHER PAIR JUST TO MAKE SURE I HAVE A BACK UP IF SOMETHING EVER HAPPEN TO THEM......THIS IS THE FIRST REVIEW I HAVE EVER WRITTEN..... HOPE IT HELPS...... BY THE WAY AMAZON IS AMAZING I JUST SENT BACK SOME BUSHNELL 20 X 50 POWER ZOOM SOMETHING... WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK I CANT BELIEVE IT GOT SOME GOOD REVIEWS.......BUT AMAZON TOOK THEM BACK ASAP.. TOLD YOU BINOHOLIC !!!!!!!!! TRUST ME YOU WANT MUILTIPLE SETS OF BINO'S FOR DIFFERENT THINGS..... BUT THIS SKYMATERS 15 X 70 & NIKON ACULON 10 X 50 IS A GOOD START OF YOUR BINO COLLECTION>>>>>
4,Purchased these about a month ago and really like them. I have gone out every night it wasn't cloudy. The moon is really clear and detailed found Mercury 2 evenings ago easily (it was right above Venus)looking at Saturn I could make out the general shape although I can't really see rings found the whirlpool galaxy (it is like a smudge against the black sky) beehive cluster was easy to find. Pointed at places where no stars were visible by eye and found the lenses filled with stars. They are a little hard to hold steady by hand even by propping elbows but I have thoroughly enjoyed these binoculars. My binoculars were shipped for free in 5 days-no damage and needed no adjustments. Eventually I plan to get a tripod for them.
5,These binoculars are just plain amazing for the price. The crisp images of the star fields in Saggitarius is worth the price alone not to mention the beautiful views of the Lagoon nebula Orion nebula and Andromeda galaxy.Past reviews have pretty much summed it all up but I wanted to offer some helpful advice to those who are having difficulties with the tripod adapter. First of all the outlet to screw in the adapter to the binoculars s under the screw off cap in front on the binoculars. When using the binoculars and tripod adapter on a tripod out of box you may find that the adapter bends making the binocular view swing left to right. To remedy this buy some epoxy for plastic at your local hardware store the good kind is the kind with two siringes in one and put the glue into the open space on both sides of the adapter. Glue one side at a time mix the glue in the space and let it dry solid. This should make the adapter more solid and your viewing more stable! =)
5,The binoculars are excellent for the price.  If you are critical you can observe color fringes on each sides of overhead wires against the sky but in general use you won't see such chromatic aberration(color errors).I using my Meade 8x42 binoculars and the Celestron 15x70 binoculars I compared the view of several pigeons that were about 80 feet away.  With the 8 power binoculars they appeared as if 10 feet away.  With 15 power they appeared as if they were 5 feet 4 inches away.  Believe me the difference is startling. I was seduced into to watching them for some time. In comparison at 8X: Yes I see they are pigeons for sure and move on.The same with comparing the appearance of the Moon. While with a critical eye you can see some color fringing at the edge of the Moon but I suggest you ignore that and enjoy the spectacular view at 15x - or buy better binoculars. (Better binoculars? Try the Fujinon 16x70 FMTSX Polaris Binoculars for $712!)I recommend an alternate way to hold higher power binoculars like these 15 power ones.  Hold them with one hand as usual grasping the objective lens barrel with that hand against the prism housing.  Use the other hand to grasp the other objective barrel at its outer end.  The additional leverage will enable you to hold the binoculars steadier by two or three times.Finally - about the tripod mount.  Outwardly it looks OK but in use you will quickly realize it lacks sufficient torsional stiffness it twists too easily about its vertical axis.  This makes it almost worthless as even a light breeze will set the binoculars oscillating from side to side..  One owner stiffened the mount by casting epoxy in the depressions on each side.  He used epoxy that when cured was white so the result was quite ugly.  My suggestion whittle two blocks of wood to fit the depressions drill a clearance hole through one block and the web then drive a wood screw through that block and the web into the block on the other side.
5,Wow what a difference a good pair of binoculars make! I can see so many stars and the moon is perfectly clear through these. The Celestrons are far better than the telescope we have and it's much easier to use.
4,very good
4,I got these for my boyfriend for Christmas as he has become interested in learning more about astronomy.  Since he is a beginner I thought instead of purchasing a telescope for a small fortune I would get him a good pair of binos to start with.  He loves them!  I was worried about them being out of culmination after reading all of the reviews but the pair we received are flawless.  We tried using them without a tripod for a while but quickly realized that a tripod was a must in order to see anything clearly.  We just ordered an inexpensive universal tripod and it works perfectly.  Obviously the power on these binos is not strong enough to see the surfaces of the planets but we are able to see the four moons of Jupiter and Orion's nebula and they give a great view of the moon and all of the craters.  Whether you are a beginner and wanting to learn more about astronomy or just looking to add a quality pair of binos to your collection these should not disappoint you.
5,Great quality crystal clear view of the stars and moon
5,Se demoro menos en llegar que la entrega estimada excelente producto para iniciar en observaciÃ³n astronÃ³mica y tambiÃ©n sirve para observaciÃ³n en el dÃ­a.
4,I like the binoculars. Although I may be having a fine focus issue with these bunoculars. I hope they will last. I have had a fine focus issue with another giant pair of Celestron binoculars in the past. They stand behind their products if you keep the original paperwork. Just a warning and reminder.
5,Excelente!!
5,Like everything about them
5,SÃºper recomendado. Llego 1 semana antes de lo dicho. Muy Bn empacado. Algo pesados. La experiencia de ver el cielo es increÃ­ble. SÃºper NÃTIDO. La verdad lo recomiendo !
4,These are great star spotting binoculars! Though when received I was not able to align the optics correctly turned out the lenses needed to be reseated. They may have gone out of alignment during shipping or similar though once the lenses were properly seated the optics focused and the diopter adjusted they work great!
5,It was a struggle to find a low cost and best performance from a astronomy binocular.Celestron wins.Here are my recommendations:Purchase the 15 x 70 and not the 25 x 70 for nighttime sky watching.It simply is not worth the loss of light passing thru the lens in order to obtain a slight magnification increase.The exit mm calculated for a 15 x 70 is (70 / 15) = 4.67The exit mm calculated for a 25 x 70 is (70 / 25) = 2.8As we get older our pupil size decreases. Mine happens to be 7mm.Since your mileage will vary - I recommend a larger final aperture for light to pass thru.From our very basic calculations shown above the 15 x 70 is significantly better for pupil size (1.5 times more).Buy the Barska tripod mount to accompany the Celestron SkyMaster 15x70.From outside reviews and real world use the Celestron tripod mount will not give you the performance you would expect.The Barska will.
4,Heavy but great
3,The binoculars were received and are nice. They have a soft case. The wasn't a tripod included as advertised.
3,Not bad for the price I have a pair of Nikon 7x50 ocean pros they were far clearer and brighter than these 15x70 binoculars with that said I can see further and clearer with the more expensive and lower power binoculars. I wish Nikon made a high quality pair of 12x80 binoculars I would buy them.
5,These are astronomical binoculars. This means they are large too large for handheld use. They require a tripod at the very least and it needs to be a fair sized rates for 10 lbs minimum. The tripod bracket is a little weak so if combined with a small mount the image will shake. A boom-arm type of mount is better. They are heavy duty and places the bank's away from the tripod and allow for easier view changes.You are not supposed to jamb your eyes into the eyepiece either. Holding your peepers away by a few millimeters also keeps the shakes down.These are great starter binoculars for wide views of the sky landscapes or other uses where you're not whipping them around like at a sporting event or concert.
4,It is NOT waterproof so the usage will be limited. At least you don't want to use it on lake or sea.
5,Good clear image easy to work with. They are heavy but I knew when I bought them they would be. If you want a pair to hand hold for any length of time these aren't for you but if you want to glass something for 10-20 seconds and want a clear image brought up close these are great.
4,Awesome binoculars for star gazing but too heavy for me to use without a tripod recommend buying one.
5,I've owned several pairs of binoculars in my lifetime using them for all sorts of terrestrial and celestial viewing. None impressed me as being special and some were better than others. Just recently I obtained the SkyMaster 15x70. Out of the box the lens coatings looked very evenly applied and eye relief was the best I've ever experienced. The overall feel and function was also better than what I was used to. Using them mainly for astronomy I bagged quality views of Jupiter Saturn Venus and The Moon for first light. Of course these objects look good using just about any viewing aid.During a recent star party I attended I fixed the SkyMasters to a nice heavy-duty tripod. When it finally got dark enough I wheeled the tripod head around and pointed the SkyMaster toward the Milky Way... OMG! With my naked eye I could only see a handful of stars in the direction the binos were pointing and through a pair of 10x50s a few more but peering through the SkyMasters there were hundreds of those shiny things! My son and I had a blast just hopping from one area of the sky to the next!The SkyMasters are not particularly heavy but at 15x power you will be hard pressed to hold them steady for even short periods. With that said figure on investing in a decent tripod and a metal binocular adapter for it. The SkyMaster comes with a plastic tripod adapter and it's nearly useless for a binocular this large. This is the only negative I can think of about this product.When shopping for a tripod take the SkyMaster with you to ensure that the combination of the two works for you. Using these binos on a suitable tripod is the only way you will get the steady views needed for good object resolution.My total cash outlay for both the SkyMaster and tripod came to approximately $170 with tax. Another $20 will by you a suitable tripod adapter for the SkyMaster. Also if you're thinking about purchasing a telescope for under $200 do yourself a favor and go this route. You simply will not find a descent telescope for this amount of money and the telescope won't be nearly as versatile. So If you're in the market for really nice astronomy-suitable binoculars that won't dent your checkbook give these a whirl! Also worth noting is Celestron's no-fault lifetime warranty.
4,These bins are the best value for money you are likely to come across.The field is wider than stated they are relatively light but solidly built and the optics are fine.The only problem I've had is the mount this is plastic and of no use whatsoever. It would have increased the overall quality of the product to have not included it at all. However you don't always get one included with other brands and with the low cost of the bins I was happy just to order a new metal mount for a few quid.So for an astronomy newbie these are a great first instrument although a tripod and decent mount are a must.For anyone with existing equipment or experience; these are not as good as high end optics but pound for pound (price not weight!) they are an extremely good buy.
5,My dad got these for me like two Christmases ago because I'm a huge nature fan. These have really gotten me into astronomy and stargazing. Even though I probably don't even qualify as an amateur astronomer yet (lol) I've used enough binoculars for animal watching to know a really good pair when I see them. Some of the reviews say that the focuser is lame and that it toggles on its own but mine works wonderfully. Even in the city I've already become able to identify tons of constellations (I've used the SkyGuide app by Fifth Star Labs LLC to help learn them and I highly recommend it). You can plainly see all the little pock marks on the moon as if it were on a big HD movie screen and even Saturn's little rings if you hold still long enough. My only complaint is that the tripod hookup is pretty crappy especially since the binos are heavy. The cover that's supposed to protect the eyepieces will not stay on no matter what I do either. All in all though these are the best most beautiful binoculars I've ever owned and I consider them one of my most prized possessions. I can't wait until my next camping trip so I can try them out on a real star-filled sky. Highly highly highly recommend (thanks dad)! (Also: Can anyone recommend a good tripod to use with these things?)
4,I recently took these to the cottage and mounted them to a tripod one clear and starry night.  Now I didn't see Saturn but the moon came in bright and clear exposing detail unseen by the naked eye.  Also the binoculars exposed thousands of distant stars in the background also.  It's difficult using your hands to view stars for more than 5 minutes and considering these binoculars weigh about 3 pounds even the slightest breeze or ground vibration through a tripod sometimes makes it difficult to view.  Yes the tripod adapter seems cheaply made but it does the job.  I would have also liked to have separate covers for the eyepieces instead of the one long cover which seems to easily slip off.  The instruction page included is thorough and to the point and adjusting the eyepieces was simple and worked well.  There is also a carrying bag included.These binoculars work fantastic for viewing far distant objects during the daytime aswell!
3,These are a pretty fantastic pair of binoculars for amateur astronomy. Even in light-polluted areas you can pick out some more famous targets like the Beehive Cluster and Orion Nebula. I've also had success with fainter objects in dark skies.The reason I can only give three stars is because these binoculars are notorious for having poor collimation which leads to a double image. This is a problem in many but not all of these binoculars and ended up being an issue for me. It wasn't an extremely difficult fix (you'll need a precision screwdriver and preferably a tripod) but it seems like they are having major quality control issues with this. Note that this pair is over a year old so the issue may have been resolved by now.Take note that these binoculars have a decent weight and high magnification. This will result in a shakey field of view if you are holding them. I recommend purchasing a tripod but they're still worthwhile if you don't.
3,I received these binoculars as a gift and was initially impressed with how well they work. I got them focused easily at first and the magnification is impressive. I noticed that one eye was focusing and the other wasnât moving. After closer inspection the pin that holds the two sides together is sheared past the right optic. I guess I could constantly put pressure on one side while focusing. Really a shame because I feel like these should be awesome. I guess I need to contact the gift givers for receipts and return information. Not something I relish doing.
4,like
5,I bought these prior tot the 2006 baseball season - the package arrived an hour before I left for the stadium. Night game overcast. From a seat thirty feet above the field and six rows behind the centerfield warning track I was able to read the pitcher's lips in a conversation with the manager on the mound.For years I have tried many pairs of binoculars from the "cheap seats" After one game I just had to write this review - these will transform the sporting experience - you'll see the players up close as if on television but in crisper detail than any scren would capture. While it is tough to follow lightning quick action over a large playing field it is with any pair of binoculars - these are for focusing on players up close. I watched the Angels laugh and horse around in the dugout before the game in between innings et cetera. I even zoomed in on the team owner in his luxury box!These binoculars make the cheap seats seem like the best Season Seats.
2,Look I have a lot of experience with these cheap Chinese binoculars.  I can virtually assure you they will not be collimated when you receive them.  Rate it at 95% chance.  Good news is the optics are very good.  Mechanicals are for the most part good although you may get a pair that will need to the eyepiece bridge tightened.  I work for an international dark sky park and have seen many of these.  The average person doesn't even realize how bad they are until I point it out to them.  Good news is there are a few screws on the  prism housings that allow you to eliminate double images.  You will either see double images or suffer from eye strain when using them out of the box.  A good pair of 15X70's (Fujinon) will run north of $1000.  Get these for $60.  When collimated the image is 90% of the expensive ones.  If you don't believe me mount the Celestron's on a tripod and look at a TV tower branch or telephone pole.  Back your eyes away 4 inches.  You will see the split.  Look up how to collimate them on youtube.  Look for the exit pupil that is not round and work on that side.  Adjust screws until the images merge and you are good to go.  Just realize what you are buying they all need help.  If you work on them a bit they are pretty decent.
5,I like the clarity of the optics and center control wheel that can fine-tune focus. You can get a pretty awesome view of the moon.
4,works great too heavy
5,These are awesome for the price. Many buyers complained about seeing double. Mine came that way as well but with a little research I learned how to collimate them. Under the rubber grip are small flathead screws. You have to pry the rubber grip up with a small blade and then adjust the screws checking your optics each time. It took me 5 minutes but then they were perfectly collimated (not seeing double). I hope this is helpful and prevents unnecessary returns. By the way I was able to see the trees on the mountaintop approximately 4+ miles away in the middle of the day. That's pretty good distance.
5,Before delivery I was on forum's that mentioned there was a collimation problem on some new units.My binoculars had no problems.Collimation is very good. Nice sharp images.Just waiting for delivery of a tripod now.
4,I bought my Celestron SkyMaster 15x70 binoculars some time ago and have had a chance to get really familiar with them.  Understanding the complaints about focusing and collimation I was fortunate to get a pair that worked well right out of the box.  Good clean anc clear images show through whether I'm doing some stargazing or terrestrial viewing.  I can use these pretty well with just my hands even though they are heavy so anyone wanting to do extended viewings might want to take advantage of the tripod adaptor that comes with them.  I used the adaptor on a tripod I got with my old camcorder and it worked just fine.  The tripod itself however is too short for my use so I'll continue to hold them until I get a tripod tall enough for my use.  And unlike the Zhumell 20x80 binoculars I have I can get right on top of the lenses without the eye relief and see really well with my eyeglasses on.  Makes a big difference.For the money this is a great pair of bionculars to have.  I've not been to many brick-and-mortar stores that carry binoculars like this - there may be some in my area but I've yet to find them - so to be able pick some up from the web and get good use out of them has been a very fortunate thing for me.
5,I was really excited to try these out since I had used a pair of my uncles that were the same brand but with higher magnification.  I was pleased with close range objects but the moon and stars were a different story. I was seeing double vision on really far away objects. I returned the binoculars for a replacement pair and the new ones are amazing. I was checking out the full moon last weekend and it was beautiful.  I was so mesmerized by the experience that I had a hard time pulling myself away. I am looking forward to using these binos for many years.
1,I bought these binoculars wishing to purchase something with decent optical quality and superior light gathering ability. I wasn't expecting anything special because the low price attracted me but even for free these binoculars are a waste of your time and energy even just carrying them around and I will explain why. Let it suffice that in a variety of daylight longer distance low dusk or night time conditions your naked eye is better. Since you were born with your naked eyes and in all conditions these binoculars make you see worse they should not be used at all since you can just see something better in all distance of lighting conditions by merely looking at it yourself. Let me explain.The fit and finish out of the box is not bad the binoculars are fairly intuitive and easy to open assemble as just the neck strap needs to be fastened and use. The focus knobs offer some stiff resistance but nothing terrible and nothing unexpected at this price range. They aren't that heavy to actually carry in your hand but once you raise them they feel poorly weighted and off balance which makes them hard to hold for more than a short period of time and even harder to fix on an object. Once you start looking through the objectives it's game over. The image is lousy; optical clarity is poor in all conditions. Despite the 70mm objective lenses images appear darker and fuzzier with detail less apparent than if you lok at them yourself. The only exception might be the Albireo double star in Cyngus this time of year where you see a blue star and a yellowish star but that is little consolation. Everything else is not only obscured by the awful optics but the binoculars are not aligned properly thus you get double vision. You can only look at things with one eye for any clarity. A quick net search showed adjustment screws under the rubber grips towards the back of the binoculars but looking for them to lift the rubber led to small tears of damage to the rubber. Trying to turn these screws in multiple ways did not actually let the image converge at all it was just as bad as when I first bought it just cockeyed in a different yet just as hard to visualize way.These binoculars are an utter waste of time and money even just looking through them with one eye which greatly spoils the experience leads to a lousy dim image that does not reveal more detail except for very bright objects. Focus is lousy image quality is lousy and the prisms are not properly aligned and are very difficult to make work in any way that would allow these already lousy binoculars to be worth using. If you only have the money to spend that these cost my suggestion would be to keep using your naked eye and save your money; the image you are already seeing is way better than the light these subpar optics will ruin. Stay away.
5,I was looking for a good set of "cheap" binos for astronomical use.  Most reports suggest not going over 10x magnification in order to ensure stability while hand-holding the binos but there were enough reports that these were usable while held that I went with them.For my money these are absolutely amazing.  While it is true that the outer 25% (give or take) of the field of view is soft and blurry the field of view itself is so large that this was of little impact.  The optics are multi-coated and honestly the coatings leave a bit to be desired and while my daylight testing made me wonder whether or not these would be passable binos for stargzing first light with the night sky blew me away.The light gathering power of the 70mm objectives is sufficient to bring the Milky Way to new life even from my light polluted suburban skies M42 is a wonder to behold and I actually found that even only about 1/4 visible the moon was so bright I couldn't look at it for extended periods.Hand-holding these binos is not a problem.  They're lighter than I expected and I actually had an easier time hand-holding these than I have had with other much lower power binos.As an all-around pair of binos for stargazing these things get my vote for "best value."  I haven't had them long enough to talk about longevity and that may ultimatley influence my opinion but for under $100 it's hard to go wrong with these.
3,The product works as advertised however there were a few horrible QA issues.The first ones I got were awful. The frame was scratched to hell and there were three huge chunks of debris inside the front lens on the left that created three very dark spots when looking through. So I sent it back. The second ones I got have one piece of debris inside the front eyepiece but for the most part it isn't noticeable and I don't feel like sending it back again. I did a little research and it's obvious why the QA is horrible: these are cheap Chinese knockoffs of expensive binoculars.The view is spectacular though if you've never owned a telescope or pair of high powered binoculars and they get the job done. Other websites have proven these are actually closer to 15x62 but whatever. The view is great and a real 15x70 from a reputable company is more than twice as expensive sometimes even over $500.In summary: you get what you pay for. Honestly horrible QA but that's to be expected from a company that cuts corners and manufactures in China so that we can get these things at a fraction of their usual price. My recommendation: if you can possibly save up $200 or more hold off on buying these and buy a pair from a reputable company. You will not regret it. If you're broke like me then these will be a pleasant surprise but be prepared to send them back in the even of a QA failure.
5,I got this for night time viewing and wild life viewing. It's worked great so far. I haven't tested it out that many times at night yet but it seems to be comparable with my Orion ED80 telescope. I can see Jupiter's moons and orion nebula in light polluted skies.The tripod adapter seems to be too small for my tripod. It still latches onto the tripod but it can fall out at a certain angle.The weight really isnt that big of a deal and didn't bother me at all. I am a regular hiker and I've hiked with these a few times already.For wild life viewing It works pretty well. Though sometimes I wish there's more magnification for things like whale and sea lion watching.The bag that came with seems to be too small for the binocular. The velcro couldn't meet up completely. When carrying this thing during hike the bag would bounce back and forth on my back which is a bit annoying.
4,These are probably a best starting point for a beginning astronomer before buying a telescope. If you find these hanging on the wall - don't buy a scope...There are plenty of deep sky objects you can see with those and the image quality is perfect.The main weak point is the tripod mount which is not sturdy and with a good tripod these binoculars are still wiggly... A bit heavy for hand use as well...
4,I recently purchased these binoculars and agree with a previous review about the lack of protective packing it was shipped with.  That being said they came out of the box collimated just fine.  For this price you can afford to replace the vinyl carrying pouch included with a hard case if you want better protections as they will not get any proction from what they give you.I bought these so I could share the night sky with my children more easily and they do not sit well with the time it takes to get out the Meade 10' scope.  On the first night we took it out the ISS came overhead shortly afterwards and we were able to track it with the binoculars relativley well but I would not suggest you try to do this for long with out a good video/camera tripod for more stationary objects unless you are going to lie on the ground looking up.The field of view is good for groupings of stars and I was able to just fit all of the three main stars of Orion's belt into view using the included tripod mount of course.This will be a staple for my night viewing form here on out.
5,Good quality and good zoom  good for the price
5,I bought these as an impulse buy to use for the lunar eclipse so I used the PrimeNow service. First of all that was amazing because I had the binoculars in an hour and a half after choosing the "free delivery" option.The binoculars themselves were great particularly for the price. Images were crystal clear and they are light enough even our 5 yr old could hold them up and see the moon. I'll probably get a tripod to make viewing easier and less shaky but even just holding them we were able to see lot's of detail from the eclipse.Summary - 3 happy kids and 2 happy adults watching the eclipse very cool.
3,No issues with the viewing quality  just wish they came with better covers for the eyepieces and objective lenses (they constantly fall off)  . Also the neck strap that comes with these binoculars appears cheaply made and is quite uncomfortable.
5,My first night out under dark skies with these binoculars was a terrific experience.  In ninety minutes of observing I had great views of M36 M37 M38 M44 M50 easily saw the Trapizium in Orion's nebula saw the Andromeda galaxy and it's companions streaching across 75% of my FOV.  It had taken me two observing sessions with my 5" reflector to find M33 with the Binoculars I found it in two minutes M81 and 82 were also easy.All this and I don't even have a tripod yet.  I may well spend more time with the 15 X 70's than I do with my telescope.They are also great for terrestrial viewing.  Contrast and definition are excellent.  Best optical value I've ever seen.
2,Optically the glass/prisms aren't great but these cost under $100 so you can't have high expectations.  Unfortunately the quality control isn't very good.  Took me a while to understand why looking through these was hurting my eyes like I was cross-eyed and seeing double or something.  Then my buddy tried them and pointed out that the optics aren't properly aligned.  "Oh."  The alignment is so bad that they actually hurt my eyes trying to use them for longer then 30 seconds or so.  For the price I didn't have really high expectations for the optical quality but having the two optical tubes not being aligned is the kiss of death for any binocular.Update: I was able to do some searches and found a video which explains how to collimate / align the optics in these binoculars.  Took about 10 or 15 minutes and I no longer see double.  Now I'm actually able to use these binoculars and my opinion of them is a little better but honestly not great.  Optically they're not very good which considering the price isn't too surprising.  These are obviously not fully-multi coated optics and who knows if they're actually using BAK-4 prisms.  All things considered I'd give them 3 or maybe 4 stars depending on how generous I'm feeling considering the price.But the binoculars I received are really only worth 2 stars because they were so HORRIBLY out of alignment.  Either the factory has no quality control or the adjustment screws (one under the right hand grip near the eye peice and the other under the rubber flap near the center hinge also on the right side optics) even after being glued in place by the factory are unable to hold alignment.
5,Arrived in excellent shape well-collimated great optics. Happy with my purchase.
5,I was trying to decide between the Nikon Action 10x50 Binoculars and the Celestron SkyMaster 15x70. I already own a smaller 9x25 compact set of binoculars and was looking for a set for stargazing. Based on the reviews of others it was clear shoppers were quite impressed with the SkyMaster.After I received the fast shipment from Amazon I was astonished by the clarity of the optics in these binoculars. The image is bright and crystal clear especially in the center of the image. Perhaps there is a little degradation in quality towards the edges but nothing that would distract from the sparkling view dead center. I can't imagine the Nikon set capturing as many high magnitude stars.The housing is well made and the focus knob is smooth. There appears to be a plastic layer covering around the long binocular chambers - the covering feels a bit loosely fitted.  Still I like the texture of the material.Also as you can imagine these binoculars will be difficult to hold steady for extended periods. Luckily a tripod adapter is included. While the adapter could be of higher quality I'm glad Celestron added this because at least I can quickly enjoy star gazing right away - I can always upgrade the adapter later. The strap is also fairly thin but seems sturdy.Overall the Celestron SkyMaster 15x70 is an outstanding value. I give it 5 stars for image quality overall construction and low price. Read no further reviews - buy them and see for yourself!
2,This is the second pair of these binoculars I've owned because they work so well when the first one broke I thought it was just an anomaly but when the second one broke in the same way because of the very tiny piece of what looks like flawed aluminum because it has bubbles in the casting I realized that these 12 x 60 binoculars that I had bought two different units of are not well built it all. Excellent function but they are as fragile as an egg. Give me a Tasco unit any day.
5,Great deal on a great pair of binocs.
5,Great for viewing the moon!
5,Used on a trip out West. These worked great!
5,Celestron 15x70. I don't own them but I've looked through them at a star party. The eye cups are hard plastic and not comfortable. The 18 mm eye relief is good for people with glasses but too much for me. If you hold them by the base of the barrels you can hand hold them very steady. I could control the aim and I nailed some deep sky objects I could barely see and easily miss in my 10x50. Andromeda looked much bigger. They are not a huge improvement over 10x50 but they definitely make it easier to see some objects. I read many people say they can see the rings of Saturn in these things.I'm buying the Nikon Aculon 16x50 for $106 because I want the smaller size for daytime use. I looked at the Pleiades through several scopes of different sizes and I think the 10x50 gave the best view.
5,After reading many of the reviews here these sounded like a good deal but given the negative reviews from folks who got bad copies I decided it would be best to buy them in person. I did that and tried them before I walked out with them. After getting them home and trying them out on a tripod for about 2 hours in daylight I have to say that the quality of the optics is amazing for this price. Center sharpness is just phenomenal and doesn't really degrade much until you look towards the edges. But if you demand edge-to-edge sharpness then you need to start spending the bucks to get it. For most of the field of view these are more than sharp enough.One small negative - the included tripod mount is way too wobbly. I reinforced it by bolting two thin metal plates to it and that helped a great deal. Someone else mentioned that they filled it with epoxy (it's an i-beam type of construction). That seems like a good idea also.But for this kind of money this is an insanely good pair of binoculars.
5,While these have some of the chromatic error one would expect from binoculars with a pricetag in the low three figure range they are of unparalleled quality for the price. The light-gathering capability of these binoculars make it unwise to look at the moon when your eyes are adjusted to the dark especially if you have sensitive eyes because you're tired.One thing I noticed for the first time (my previous binoculars were only 10x50) was that you would be well-advised to use a tripod and the included tripod adapter is functional thank goodness; I used it multiple times a week and without it my viewing experience would definitely be hampered. The magnification is high enough you definitely want to use a tripod (or lie flat on your back if you have rock-steady arms) unless you're bracing them against something. The only way around that is to buy Image Stabilization binoculars for a four-figure price tag.The quality of the lenses & coatings is superior to my previous 10x50 binoculars; they're of good quality. Really for the price and the quality level there's nothing a rational objective person has to complain about unless the delivery truck totally abused your pair. These are great high quality extremely useful binoculars from a name you can trust.And while you can't see the colors of Jupiter at this magnification you can identify the giant gas planet thanks to the moons (with a tripod or rock-steady hands). What a fun experience! Now my four and eight year old children ask me every night if Jupiter is visible just before they go to bed. :)
5,My husband and I have had these binoculars for two years now and we love them.  Our favorite use for them is looking at the night sky especially the moon and its craters.  Before we bought these binoculars we used a telescope.  The telescope was hard to use hard to focus and the view was not even close to the view with these binoculars.  We can now see the craters of the moon beautifully.We would definitely recommend these binoculars.  They are a little heavy so we just recently bought a tripod Vista Explorer 60-Inch Lightweight Tripod with Tripod Bag and it is well-worth the extra cost.
5,Great buy for stargazing living in the city it helps me see things I usually can't see with the unaided eye
5,I bought these to help ease me into the world of amateur astronomy after using my star chart and some books for a few months.  First let me recommend getting a tripod to use these for any kind of long term observations of celestial objects.  These binoculars are great for observing the moon some of the planets and binocular deep sky objects.  With these I can get great detail on the moon and have been able to use these in conjunction with my tripod to make sketches and begin to identify craters and seas on the moon.  I have been able to locate a few binary star systems with the binoculars as well as the galaxy Andromeda (M31) appears as hazy oval with a distinct galactic core appearing.  Jupiter though is my favorite target. It appears as bigger pale yellow ball.  Once focused properly the binoculars are able to pick up Galilean moons(Io Europa Ganymede and Callisto).I would high recommend this pair of binoculars to any amateur astronomer.  For those new to the hobby just remember that regardless of if you are using a telescope or binoculars you will not be getting Hubble telescope quality views.  And remember that aperture is the true judge of a good telescope not magnification.
5,I will admit this first: I did not buy these from amazon but from Adorama. However  I felt compelled to write this review because I know far more people will look for bino's on amazon than Adorama. If you are looking for a pair of astronomy binoculars with enough left over to get a tripod and not break $100 look no further. The weight of the bino's make steady viewing difficult without a tripod but thanks to the adapter that problem solves itself. The views of the moon Jupiter's moons Omega Centauri M13 the Dumbbell Nebula and even Saturn's rings (when the sky is clear and you are using a tripod) blew all my expectations out of the water. If you can afford a pair of $400 astrobinos by all means. But if you are on a strict budget like myself you can't do better.
3,I ordered this model primarily for close up views of planets & for spotting galaxies. However this model turned out to be a big disappointment for the intended purpose. One can see craters on the moon clearly but for planets or star gazing this model is a big No No. At best it can be used to spot smaller objects in space such as a group of stars very close to each other or stars invisible to naked eyes.I do not recommend this device if it is going to be your primary sky gazing device. Also this model is very heavy & cannot be used for more than 3-4 mins without a heavy duty tripod. The name skymaster is very misleading as this model is not suitable for sky gazing.However in spite of the initial disappointment I was happily surprised by the Terrestrial Land views. Land views are magnificent & this device is a definite Yes for long range Land Viewing. I could easily identify the gender of humans (:p) that were almost a km away from me & could clearly spot objects up to 3-4 kms.
5,What can I say that 283 people haven't already said?  These binoculars are a very good product.  My wife found them for $59 on Amazon.  I thought "I'm not sure I'd spend as little as $59 on a pair of 7x35's let alone a big pair of 15x70's....they're probably crap".  Well I was wrong.  Once in a while I can be surprised and this was one of those times...and I'm a discerning amateur astronomer.It's true that they are NOT "edge to edge" pin point tack sharp at the edges as some higher end binos BUT they are darn good.  Contrast is good and the center 80% is razor sharp.  Color correction is good also.  There is a quality feel and a secure feel in your hands because of the rubberized outer coating.  Honestly I'd think they were a good deal at $189 let alone $59--they're that good.  The case and end caps are high quality too. Buy with absolute confidence as to the quality.  Just think if you're one of the 5% who could not be happy with these binoculars then they'll make a darn nice $59 gift for one of your less snobby friends :)Hand holding is still possible and enjoyable...but takes practice to be steady. ENJOY!
4,I looked at the moon and it was enjoying. When I first used it I thought I was watching a 3d movie. It was good. I found that it has a bit focus problem or I do not know how to use it yet.
4,Please be advised that while Amazon says this product weighs 1.5 lbs. the Celestron website lists it at 48 oz. (3 lbs.) Best to compare specs there. (I have not used this product. Ignore the rating.)
4,Service was great. Had some great evenings to observe the planets and moon. Jupiter was clear in the South East sky. The binoculars were able to see all four major moons of Jupiter. They allow you to see stars that you cannot see with the naked eye. Would recommend a steady service to brace your elbows for a more shakey free view. They are not heavy and very easy to hold for extended time. I am very happy with this purchase.
5,My brother and I were messing around with these last night and were able to see Jupiter and 4 of its moons
5,Great for the price. Tripod needed.
1,Totally bummed. My brother had brought these for me as a gift. Iâm a middle school science teacher and I was so excited to use them!  However they were never in stereo. By the time I found time to deal with them I no longer get had the original paperwork and they are out of warranty. So I took them to the repair shop $150 to get them working and they are unlikely to stay in stereo so... this brand is pretty crappy according to the repair shop and the ones that are decent have a lifetime warranty. A little sad actually. I just left them at the shop so they didnât end up in a dumpster. On a teacher budget I donât have the money to keep them in repair.
5,Had the opportunity to see the space station fly over recently. The view was amazing! I did however realize I need a tripod. The weight is a little too muchfor a woman of my age. I recommended them highly. Wish I had bought them sooner!
5,Excellent product! They were my Hubby's b-day gift and he just LOVES them! For me they are pretty heavy to hold but the view is great!
5,Awesome!  Definitely worth every penny!!!
5,I got these for my dad. He just moved to a condo on the water and had been wanting binoculars for a while. My step mom ended up getting him some the same time i did for his birthday but he told me he liked these more because they were more clear and he could see the cruise ships which were further away.
5,Great clarity can easily see a faint Andromeda and Orion's nebula clearly in South Jersey suburbia. This out performs my celestron powerseeker 70eq.Somewhat heavy but that's a good thing and bad thing. Good cause they are built like a tank. Could probably drop them off a cliff and still work but feel like I've lifted weights all day after holding it for an hour. Get it on a tripod.
5,I looked through them before giving them to my boyfriend for his birthday and I could see all the way to the trees about 2 miles off and had they not been there I could've seen farther. They are a bit heavy but overall I think they're good ones. Didn't get the chance to try them at night though.
5,We did a lot of research into various small telescopes and binoculars before deciding to buy the "Celestron SkyMaster Giant 15x70 Binoculars". We already own aÂ   Meade ETX90EC Telescope w/ UHTC Autostar Controller (497) and Tripod (884)         but find that setting it up can often become a time consuming production especially when we just want a quick view of something in the night sky. Sure our regular telescope is better for looking at planets and provides much higher magnification but there are times when we don't use it because of the hassle of transporting it and setting it up. With the Celestron SkyMasters and a good monopod we are now ready to view both terrestrial events and stargazing in just a few minutes.Here are my observations:Pros:Very Clear OpticsCrisp Focusing (no "bounce" or drift at all)Built In Tripod Mount and Included Adapter (must use with binoculars this powerful)Very Inexpensive For Binoculars of This QualityCons:HUGE Size (these are BIG you will need a tripod/monopod for extended use)Overall the Celestron SkyMaster is a great pair of binoculars for the price Highly Recommended! You might also want to considerÂ   Galileo 20x60 Binoculars
4,My wife and I recently purchased the Celestron Sky Master 15 x 70 binoculars and have been totally happy with them.  We live on the prarie in WY and have miles upon miles of uninterupted view and these binoculars bring it all with in an arms reach (or so it feels).  We have used them for hunting and even just sight seeing.  We love these bino's.  The only draw back is that they are too heavy for hiking or long backpacking trips other than that they are wonderful.  I would recomend getting a more durable case for them though the one that comes with them is no better than a dust cover.
5,Bought for my son. He is very careful to research a purchase and he was happy to see that I followed his choice.
5,very good clarity from maui to molokai and lanai and all the boats and whales inbetween
4,I bought it last month and used it for both landview and star observation.Luckly I did not meet the alignment problem desicribed before by other users. And it gives very nice color when observing mountain/city in the sun shine/cloudy situation as well as the almost maxium magnification for binoculars.However it is relatively weak for star observation. the weight is not so heavy but still hard to stabilize the vibration even with my $40 tripod used for my Fz20 camera the 15* amplification is far from enough to have a clear view of any astronomic objectives except the moon.
5,Wow never would I have imagined a pair of binoculars could be this fantastic for this price. There's enough on here to learn the details I am just writing to add the WOW for the reviews. WOW. I can see details on the moon!! No kidding!!
5,Purchased these for my hubby's birthday. He is very pleased with them :)
5,Nice quality good price.  As they are quite large use with recommended tripod. Perfect for watching the abundant wildlife in our area.
5,Was able to see the last blood moon as if I was looking through a telescope!  This thing allows you to see the craters on the moon!
5,My binoculars were perfectly collimated and the quality is amazing at the price but factor in the $15-$20 additional expenditure for a different heavy duty adapter.These binos require use of a tripod for any extended usage but you must also purchase a more substantial L adapter than the one provided.  There considerable play in the screw at the end of the provided adapter which makes for a shaky view.  In addition due to the fact that it is merely molded plastic with little cross bracing the adapter flexes and vibrates given the leverage of the binoculars and will not steady with your eyes pressed against the binoculars.  I bought an oberwerk heavy duty adapter instead and the difference in build quality and strength was immediately obvious as it is metal cast has a rubber foot and the screw is far tighter.  The provided adapter simply wasn't meant to be used with binoculars of this size.I'm using them with a manfrotto/bogen tripod and head which is 4x the price of the binocular but enables rock solid viewing and no stooping even when viewing the zenith.
5,I want to know that can I use this for bird watching too iam a casual lover of watching birds and sometimes sky during the night  so do you think this product will help me for both purposes I am not expecting too much  If I find more interest than I will go for some more expensive products. Please.
1,To many negatives. No self respecting company would sell defective products  regardless of price.
3,Can these be used as regular binoculars or do they only work well at night?
2,I use these for antelope hunting in Wyoming. There very good to use at dusk you can see animals in the dark! However they only lasted 2 years. A piece on the inside came off and glue is all over the lense.
1,Horrible double image. Completely useless. Spend $30 more and get one of the Nikon Aculon models you will be MUCH happier.
5,These are the best! You can see wonderful detail on the moon and they are also great for general use.
5,GLASSES OR JUST GREAT THE CLARITY IS SO GOOD AT THOSE LONG DISTANCES GLAD I GOT THEM... DON'T MIND THE WEIGHT THATS TO BE EXPECTED ANYWAY.
5,I could never expect to see what I did the first clear night I took these out. Having little to no experience viewing the night sky the result is inspiring. My first object was the Pleiades cluster. After some other views of stars and the moon (which is amazing) I turned to find the Orion Nebula. A faint glow of pale green can be seen emitting from the center but make sure to try and stay steady. Being that the magnification is so high steadiness becomes a problem. Its ok for clusters stars etc. but if you want to focus on any faint objects or even catch a good look at the moon and planets a tripod is essential. Trying to view Jupiter using only my hands produced a small dot of light shaking around violently in my view. As soon as I put them on a tripod not only could I see a steady ball of light (no bands or anything like that) but to my surprise I was able to make out at least 3 of the moons. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to anyone looking for a good way to enter the hobby.
5,I like the way the binocs  vision can be set individually for each eye.  I am enjoying viewing stars that I ordinarily would not be able to see without some sort of enlargement!
5,they work good and can see far.
5,Got it  Tx
2,They work great!... but for me it was only for about 2 months after that the focus wheel just stopped working so...
5,I looked around for a while before settling on the Celestron SkyMaster binoculars.  While I enjoy looking at the stars my main focus (no pun intended) was finding something more powerful than my pocket binoculars for backyard bird watching.  I have several feeders set up about 60 feet from the house and I was worried that these might be overkill.I shouldn't have been worried!  Not only do I have a great view of the birds at the feeders but I can now see farther back into the woods to watch the non-feeder birds looking for insects in an old fence post.  I can't wait to use these to keep an eye out for the deer family that passes through every evening.  I haven't had a chance to do much stargazing but I was able to get a great view of the moon and I was thrilled to be able to see craters along the edge.These are HUGE binoculars (so big that friends have said they look like something out of Inspector Gadget) but surprisingly they aren't that heavy for short-term viewing.  You will definitely want to make use of the tripod adapter if you're planning to use the binoculars for extended viewing and I agree with the reviewer who recommended finding another case since the one that comes with the binoculars is basically good only for carrying them not protecting them.
5,This binocular for astro-viewing is an excellent piece of equipment priced very low. The weight of the binocular is not very high and if you are star-gazing continuously for a long time you may take short breaks after 10 or 15 minutes to rest your hands.This binocular is easy to use that small kids can take a peep into the celestial spectacles and get interested in astronomy. For those in the 7th decade of their lives--seniors like me--this giant bino is a good alternative for telescopes which are tedious and tiring for long gazing though of course no bino can replace a telescope fully for serious study of deep-sky objects.
4,These are a very good pair of binoculars foir this price. One tip: wash your hands after use. The outside coating seems to rub off a bitter tasting material that sticks to your hands after use.
1,These have already broken (worked less than 60 days). ð¥ only 30 day return ploicy.  They were cool when they worked.
5,Review history is really significant-very helpful. This is all  I want to say. This is all  I want to say
1,I had to return this product because it was out of collimation. I'm sure the product in itself is good but if you can go to the store to check that the pair you're buying is good then do so.  BTW Amazon was great in taking the return at no cost for me and refunding the money but why go through the process if you can get very similar prices at your local store.
3,Bulky and heavy.
5,I am very pleased with this purchase and it arrived fast and in one piece.  I was not sure what to expect  but these binos really blew me away.  I love stargazing and nature watching.  These binos are perfect for me.
4,Got tired of lugging my 8" Schmidt-Cass out so me and my daughter could look at Jupiter etc.  Worked great out of the box no issues with focus or anything like that all was good.  A bit bulky to hold still when looking at planets or smaller objects especially for a youngster like my daughter (7 y/o) but mounts fine on tripod.  Very pleased so far.  Good bang for the buck.  Now I can save the scope for the really special things.
4,I use these binoculars for birdwatching from my windows. There's nothing like getting a good closeup view of a bird that's 50 yards away. The field of view is wide enough that I can usually keep a flying bird in focus. That's a lot of fun! Since it is rubberized I can rest the front on the window to steady it and rest my arms. Plus now when I'm in the field my 10x50s seem feather light.These binoculars are not fully multi-coated like my 10x50s. I am saving 5 stars for fully multi-coated. If you can afford more than one pair of binoculars you should get these.
4,These are great for stellar/lunar viewing especially for kid usage however a solid sturdy tripod is a MUST.  Also the eyepiece covers don't stay on too well when stored.  All-in-all a great buy!
5,Found the Skymaster 15X70 Binoculars good astronomical investment when you don't want to pull a telescope outside.  The price is right.
5,It is unbelieveble to get this great magnify binocular with the cheap price. The only fault is the cap of eyepieces and objectives fall easily
4,I purchased this scope for a start in astronomy.  Previously I had owned Tasco which felt like plastic.  This feels solid but heavier.  This scope is somewhere between a low power telescope and binocular.  It's high maginiciation makes it impossible for studying constellations but it's bigger lenses gather more light.  I can actually tell the craters on the moon.One word of caution the tripod adapter is on the front not on the back so don't try to tear that rubber seal apart.  it wasn't clear in the instruction it came with.
5,a very good piece of equipment for hunting clear and will buy another one later on for my son soon
5,My daughter loves them!!!  We can see craters in the moon!  Excellent fun learning toy. I would recommend them for sure.
4,had no problems with purchacing or shipping havnt had a chance to really try them out yet but for the money you cant beat them
4,Very good optics.  A bit heavy but worth every extra ounce.  The tripod adapter is pretty cheesy but does work.Recommend for anyone looking toward the heavens.
5,Great quality and great value.  I love these binoculars for night sky gazing and i am confidemnt you will too.  Well  made sturdy and powerful.  They really make the night sky pop for what they are.  Considering the price these are absolutely ideal for someone like myself beginning to explore the wonders of the universe.  They come with a convenient carrying case and a tripod mount attachment.  I highly recommend these binoculars.
5,perfecto....
5,I'm new to star glazing and I always thought that I should get a telescope in order to see anything up there.  But I was wrong.  BTW I also wanted to introduce my 3 yr old kid to this hobby...  After doing some research I decided to buy Celestron SkyMaster 15x70 instead.  I was amazed by so many stars I could see through this binocular.  The place I live has lots of light pollution but I can see hundreds more already.  I also like the tripod mount a lot.  I was able to set up a simple station in my room point to some interesting places and let my 3 yr old daughter see something.  It only took me 10 minutes to setup with lots of "help" from my daughter.  I'm glad that both she and I could use this binocular and explore the great sky.
3,Los binoculares excelentes cuando le iba instalar el trÃ­pode  los lentes se desajustaron . Y como estoy en Colombia la garantÃ­a no me la cubre
1,Rubber grips started cracking about 2 months after I started using them.  The warantee covers it but you have to send a $25 check with them for them to fix it and you have to pay to send them back also ~$25 it's not worth it.
4,I would of gave it 5 stars if the eye piece cover would fit better. That is the only thing I have a problem with.These are an excellent pair of binoculars. I can not compare them with more expensive ones since I have not used more expensive ones. You can see all 4 moons of Jupiter I couldn't of been more pleased with these. I recommend a tri-pod though.
5,I am very happy with this purchase. The binocs are comfortable to use and adjust and I did not have any collimination issues. The tripod adaptor works well - the cap screws off and the instructions do not tell you this so I have pry scatches on it from failed attempts. There is a lot of light coming into these things but the 15X (as reviewed by others) is hard to stabilize. The tripod does not allow you to really get your eyes up tight to the binocs without shaking. I found that you can hold the binocs while on the tripod and this gives good stability. You do need a tripod about 1' taller than you to look at most overhead objects. Very good for watching elk at dusk as well.
5,I bought these instead of a small telescope and I'm very happy with them. The optics are very clear. The build quality seems very good. And the price is right. I can't really ask for much more. If I could maybe that they be water-proof instead of 'water-resistant'. I've been using them for some basic stargazing and sightseeing etc. I'm steady enough to use them without a tripod but one is recommended for any serious astronomy use. ..One tip if you're not using a tripod. Hold the binoculars at the end of the lenses not in the middle. They'll be much more steady.
1,Seem to work well but the handle on the tripod mount broke upon first use.  I guess they were trying to save money because the plastic is cheap.
5,I won't babble on about optics b/c I don't know much about them but in good seeing conditions you can distinguish some great star clusters through these (my first Messier objects) Jupiter's disk and moons (very small but it's unmistakably a planetary disk and several tiny moons) and though you can tell Saturn's shape it's not a great view. Because you get such a view through these images do wobble massively so it's hard to make out the finer details as when viewing small objects or trying to see lunar craters (which are gorgeous through these). Training your hands to be more still will go a long way though and I have so far not attempted to use a tripod. Maybe I'll post another review when I do. All in all I highly recommend these for someone just starting out viewing solar system and deep sky objects.
1,You would think that Celestron would recall this Junk!! I am a road warrior so I bought the junk and waited until I return home in 3-4 months. (After the warranty ran out of course) When I open up the junk and try the junk out you guess this out of COLLIMATION. I am really piss at Celestron For the fact when I call them up about the warranty they gave me the most stupid suggestion I have ever heard. In order for me to get the junk fix. 1. For me to not only pay for the return postage. 2. Pay to get the junk fix. 3. Also it going to take about 4 to 5 months to fix the junk (WTF) Well this is the worse purchase I have ever purchase on the internet. They got me I was rip off for $70. Notice that in this paragraph I did not ever use the word binoculars I use the word junk. I might as well bought this junk from Fred G. Sanford because I felt like the dummy Lamont for buying this piece of JUNK.
5,I'v been loking at thies binoculars for some time and this is by far the best deal i'v seen. Orion telescop sell them for over 120$ amazon had them for 74$ I curently use a 8inch dob telescope and sometimes its hard to find the things im looking for but w/ the binoculars it make it easy w/ the big field of view. Andromida is a breez to find. I would recomend this product to any one in to astromony just keep em in the car for a quick view. thank you so much amazon..... jonathan in ohio
1,I purchased a pair of Celestron binoculars approximately 20 years ago. Recently the finish started coming off on my hands leaving a sticky black residue. I contacted Celestron by e-mail and after several e-mail exchanges they took no responsibility. They claimed it was the result of oxidation and stated they had seen it before. Granted the binoculars are 20 years old but I have another pair of binoculars that are well over 50 years old that have been stored with the Celestron binoculars and were identically pampered. The finish is fine. Also as I pointed out to Celestron binoculars are not automobiles or dishwashers with limited life cycles. With proper care it seems they could last indefinitely. My Celestron binoculars are now wrapped in duct tape to avoid the residue on my hands. Celestron's Technical Support person Alex Cave essentially responded "Sorry. It happens. Thank you." I would encourage those in the market for new binoculars to find a provider with a quality product that the company is willing to stand behind.
2,Binoculars seemed great but when I looked through the eye pieces the view was not synchronized I saw two uncorrelated views.Returned and Amazon credited me the day I sent back the package.
5,I purchased these binoculars mainly for astronomy observations. They excell at it. The collimation was spot on right from the start . They focus stars to perfect pin points. They have a pretty wide field of view and enough power to show you the orion nebula jupiter and its moons as well as a dim m31(andromeda galaxy. They are even better if mounted to a tripod. They  are also excellent for terrestial viewing as well. Both day and night they are sharp thropughout th whole field of view. Very minor chromatic abberation on the moon. For the price of these binoculars and them coming with a case and tripod adaptor you cannot go wrong. They have superb optics for the price. The optics are just as good if not better than many much more expensive binoculars.  A great buy!
3,These binoculars are big weigh 4 pounds have lots of magnification and a narrow field of view. They are not something to just carry with you to a football game. They are nice for astronomy giving good light grasp for very low cost.The main problem is the tripod adaptor which is plastic and has no lateral bracing.Binoculars with more than 10x magnification cannot be held steady by hand. You must have a tripod and attach them to it. Therefore the adaptor is CRITICAL and this one is all but useless. If I so much as touch my nose to the side of one of the eyepieces these binoculars begin to oscillate from side to side taking maybe 10 seconds to die out.I'm going to have to find an aftermarket adapter for this product.
5,I will def. recommend this product. It's been only 4 days but I really like this thing it has amazing clarity and not that bulky but for sure you will feel the weight within 10 seconds and thats the only issue.Still much better if you will compare to telescope. And again you need to compare the price with bulky telescopes as well. So by all means good enough for amateur astronomer like me.....
3,I purchased these as a gift for myself but I ended up returning them.  I was having problems focusing them.  They also were quite heavy to hold for more than 5 minutes and I was looking for something that I could really stargaze with for a longer length of time.  And I also returned them because they just didn't quite give the views/magnification I was looking for which I didn't realize until trying to use them.  That all being said they were clearly a good product and not a waste of money.  Just not what I was looking for.
4,I think this is a great pair of binoculars - only one draw-back and that is they are heavy - I appreciate the tripod adapter which helps.  I have a tripod and can really enjoy the birdsand wildlife.
5,If you are considering purchasing these binoculars all I can say is NOW! For the price these are the best investment you can make for amateur astronomy. I took these things outside the first chance I got and was blown away. On my first night with them I saw the orion nebula the beehive star cluster and four moons of jupiter. I took along with me my old pair of 7x35 and there is no comparison. Through the 15x70's the beehive cluster fills the view and at least 30 stars are visable through the 7x35's the beehive cluster could easily be mistaken for a smudge! Also some people might be leary of the 15x magnification as it makes the view wobbly but I have had no problem with shakiness and the scopes are light enough to be comfortable for half an hour of viewing. And I'm no muscle head just your average 90 pound science geek. These scopes are a great investment and more than fairly priced so don't think twice.
1,I don't think it's a good idea to order binocs this size with USPS. I bought mine from a store and there is negligible protection - no substantial styrofoam protection - not necessarily the fault of Celestron.You can put all the fragile stickers you want on a box and it will get tossed and thrown around like you wouldn't believe. I know I used to work in the post office.
5,EXCELLENT PRODUCTVERY GOOD
1,I went through two pair. The first pair that I recieved were broken. The left eye-piece was completely separated from the focuser. The replacement pair had a serious double imaging problem. At this point I plan to try a different brand. I won't go back to Celestron. I will say that the order handling was excellent. The first pair arrived early and the replacement pair was delivered two days after I requested them. It's too bad that such great service was ruined by such poor quality merchandise.
5,If you're getting started in Astronomy this is a great first step to seeing the universe in a way you might not have thought possible. Don't go the cheap telescope route. For the same money or less you can get a Celestron SkyMaster Giant and leap forward in your ability to see and identify stars and constellations. One word of caution however these are pretty heavy. If you're buying them for someone under the age of 14 get the tripod as well.
5,A very clear view and easy to adjust.  Viewing through these binoculars is best done using a heavy duty tripod due to the weight and the difficulty in holding them steady.
4,For only $60+ this bino can be effectively used for terrestrial n astronomy purposes although relatively sharp focus on objects is not acheiveable with the skymaster 15x70. But the overall quality:price = good:cheap.
1,I do not care what product you purchase from them if it has any sort of problem and you try to contact Celestron YOU WILL BE SORRY! They have put me on hold each time I have called to find out why they have had my C65 spotting scope for over two months and since they do not have an 800 number I gave up after waiting over an hour and had to pay that phone bill myself. Forget about email because when you try to send them one you type all of your information in and try to submit it and you are told that your email was not submitted and you are transfered to their knowledge base to try to find out an answer to your problem even though the company is the problem. I have tried to requeste that I have my scope returned so that I can send the piece of junk back to the comany I purchased it from for a refund but it is like trying to talk to CD player I can't get it back and they won't talk to me so it looks like I through away $70.00 + dollars on nothing.  Take my advice stay as far away form their merchandise as possible.
5,These are awesome binoculars!  Very clear images of planets and stars.  I looked at mars and I could clearly see the roundness of the planet just like the full moon.  The only thing is its hard to hold it steady with your hands.  If you want a perfectly still image you have to use a tripod of some kind.
5,Flawless -- worth twice the price.  Much lighter and more practical than the more expensive modelsNote: no instructions for the tripod mount; unscrew the cap on the front that has the Celestron logo on it. Or skip the tripod and just move your grip out to the front of the binoculars for more stability.
5,I used them last night to see sky at 20:00. I saw very clear Orion and its Nebula Pleiades star cluster saturn venus.Not very good to use holding them by hand. So make sure to use a heavy tripod.Next step: a reflector telescope.
5,I bought these for my boyfriend so that he could use them to watch everything from shore birds to stars and they are perfect. This is a great product you can see anything with these binoculars and focusing is very easy.  Does take a little getting used to the weight but they are a great much more flexible alternative to a telescope and so is the price.
5,I purchased these for my astronomy class in school and they turned out to be a great pair of binoculars. I could see all the constellations and the surface of the moon as though I was looking at my hand. Highly recommend
1,Glass is not bad for cheap Binoculars.Mine fell apart in my hands.real flimsy brass part  hold eye pieces together.was on lawn chair looking up and eye pieces fell off.I fixed them myself remove brass screw insert a metric bolt with a washer.cannot come apart againIf you pay junk prices expect junk. .
5,No long review needed here. These binoculars are a flat out steal for the price. I was amazed on what a great view of the moon and Mars I got with these even in the city! I can't wait to try them without the city glare and haze. Better than a $100 telescope! I will advise you to use a tripod though (shakes due to the wieght).  Buy them now they will make you happy!!!!
5,After shopping around I decided to buy the 15X70 Binocularsthey work great any where at night or daythey are a little heaver than a set of 10X50'but the view is worth it.It's a great buy for the price.
1,Don't recommend that brand!This product was not alighned and was not able to show clead object.I got it for astronomy observation so the stars were brurredWe also had telescope same brand. Never ever again!
5,I bought for general star/planet/moon gazing.  I could not be more pleased.  I also brought up to the lake this weekend.  Everyone was very impressed by the large clear bright image.  The tripod mount works well for longer viewing.I am so impressed I also bought my dad a pair.
5,Love the tripod mount.  Crystal clear viewing is terrific.  Better than most telescopes with twice the power and the price is right.
5,I purchase this on december 2006 i have other 10X50 binocular but when i look at sky through this binox..it's amazing!!! i recommend it for astronomy and birding trip...
3,I am pleased with these binoculars. I have been using them mainly for viewing astronomical objects such as double stars stellar clusters galaxies etc. For the price they have done what I wanted them to do. However the tripod adapter is made of plastic and oscillates whenever touched. This means that you cannot come into contact with the binoculars while viewing or you will have to wait until the oscillations are dampened over time. The adapter should have been made of metal.
5,I'm an avid backpacker and a novice bird observer and have found the SkyMaster binoculars to exceed my expectations especially given the price.  The night sky is yours to explore.
5,These binoculars are INCREDIBLE!!!  You can actually see the craters on the moon!!!  A bit heavy but with a heavy duty tripod it does the job!
5,Great magnification and large field of view. Very lightweight and the tripod adapter is a real plus for this fine optical gear.
1,This binocular is fine for a field scope at its lowest magnification but for stargazing unless you want a double image of everything forget it. No one in my family could adjust it to work at higher magnification.  I am familiar with adjusting optics as I once worked with a very high power zeiss microscope for a living. The left ocular was loose so we sent it back to celestron. They supposedly adjusted it and sent it back same problem. The left ocular was still loose. Still double images at higher power. By this time Amazon would no longer refund it.We will no longer purchase from Amazon. After several phone calls Celestron agreed to send a new set that an employee would make sure worked properly before sending. Well they were better now the double image was crystal clear but the left ocular still loose. Now we are stuck with them.
1,Not as expected weak optics
1,Nice views but the two views are out of alignment...  So pretty worthless for me.  Nice if you close an eye but they are binoculars.  So no good for me I'm afraid.
2,I'm not happy with mine.  They suffer from ghosting when I view planets.  Only the center 2/3ds of the field of view is relatively clear (except for the ghosting).  These are cheap binoculars and you would be better served spending a little more and getting a lot more binocular.
5,They work great
3,Edges are a bit fuzzy and optics are obviously not great quality but well worth the money for what you get.With a monopod you should have no trouble seeing 4 moons of Jupiter (has been cloudy so haven't been able to try yet).Collimation is slightly off but for this price I don't mind cutting the rubber and manually adjusting the prisms for a quick fix.
4,Muy buena calidad los binoculares pensÃ© que serÃ­a difÃ­cil utilizarlos sin trÃ­pode pero no fue asÃ­... sÃºper recomendables! Los accesorios muy mala calidad en comparaciÃ³n con los binoculares y el precio de estos.
5,crisp and clear Pleiades Andromeda just wonderful.
2,We bought this to see the moon and the stars. It is very hard to keep steady and thus very difficult to see the stars. We will be testing it for bird watching but I'm not very hopeful
5,Nice binoculars for bird watching and long distance viewing. Purchased Victiv T72 tripod which works well. Would not recommend the Celestron Smartphone adaptor. Had no luck in setting it up!
2,I could not hold it up to my eyes
5,We can see everything very clearly.  Purchased for wildlife and scenery viewing.
5,best binoculars i've ever had. no complaints. good focus resolution diopter that works for my poor eyesight.
4,what I dislike most is when magnification is set at max.  it is not crystal clear anything below works well. I did not attempt to hold the binoculars at all. The quality over all is four stars. All adjustment nobs are stiff out of the box which should be with higher power scopes/binoculars. These binoculars are on the heavy side which is also a good thing for stability. If you take care of these they should last a life time. P.S. Don't hang these around your neck.....
5,These astronomical binoculars are perfect for spotting objects of interest and useful for pointing my higher powered telescopes in the right direction.
5,I got these for stargazing 2 years ago but love them for daytime use as well. They feel sturdy and solid but not so heavy that you can't hold them steady. The optics  were sharp and collimated out of the box and these glasses do have that "wow" factor with the 4.4 degrees FOV. Scanning the milky way or looking down from a peak are a real pleasure with these especially for less then a note. After so many hikes and dirt roads they needed adjustment which was easy once finding the hidden prism set screws under the grips. The set screw is right behind the top edge of the grip recess on either tube if you peel the grips back a bit. The included manual has no mention of this.EDIT 6\21Thousands of miles. Dozens of trips. These big glasses have given so many memories. Monitoring\surveying over projects sites and properties. Clear moonless night skies in the Sierras and deserts. Checking out surf spots. Marine life\spotting in the Santa Barbara Channel. Target practice with the big 'uns. And especially the BIRDS.
5,These are a major upgrade over my other binoculars. Large but well balanced. Nice cushioned grip for extended viewing. Comes with a basic case. Optics seem good.
5,Better than I thought even better with a tripod
5,Muy bueno y poderoso
5,The 4.4 field of view is excellent for astronomy. I attached a monopod camera mount to it which makes it much easier to hold and maneuver while scanning the night sky.
5,Buena calidad de lentes y terminados
5,I wasn't sure what to expect from these binocs but last night I had my kids outside viewing the Orion Nebula with these. Such a neat experience as I'd never seen it (outside of a picture) before. I'm very happy with my purchase.
5,We've now bought both the 25x70 and 15x70 SkyMasters and here are some thougths (Under a Bortle-4 level sky):For long-term stargazing the 15x70 SkyMaster is by far the better one because of stability of the view. The 25x zoom shakes so much that it needs a tripod which often is a bit more hassle to set up.With the 15x70 you can still see Uranus and Neptune the moons of Jupiter clearly the shape of Saturn vaguely the shape of Andromeda clearly and gazing into the Pleiades or Milky Way in deep fascination and wonder. It's a good step up from standard 10x50 for more detail and discovery in the night sky while still having enough field of view to see the "bigger picture".Though;For stunning views the 25x is the better one - the mountain ranges on the moon the little gap between Saturn and the Rings or the bands and moons of Jupiter (not the red spot) are all breath-taking.
4,First of all i want to say that its a very good product for beginners who are interested in astronomy and telescopes are expensive for them.Very important note-YOU WILL NEED A TRIPOD AND A MOBILE MOUNT IF YOU WANT TO TAKE SOME GOOD PHOTOSAND TRIPOD IS NECESSARY EVEN IF U ONLY WANT TO OBSERVE AS THIS THING IS HEAVYY. AND HOLDING IT IN HAND IS NOT VERY COMFORTABLE AND VERY SHAKY.But its a nice product with great focus.You will see a little bit chromatic aberration but its okay.DON'T HAVE MUCH HIGH HOPES YOU CAN'T SEE THINGS LIKE SATURN'S RINGS AND JUPITERS SPOTS AND ITS NOT FOR DEEP SKY OBJECTS.I have attached some pics of moon and jupiter i captured through this.
4,I bought these binoculars after returning the Celestron 10X50 and Celestron PowerSeeker 60AZ Telescope. The reason I returned them was cause I didn't get the views I wanted and found them to be very basic though I was on a tight budget as well. Finally I saw the must spoken of 15X70 in the Amazon sale for 7979. I know reviewers here had got an even better prices but then unfortunately that was the lowest I could get! Here is my review as an astro-viewer more than a terrestrial viewer!Pro's:1. View and zoom is good if you are accepting it as a realistic person.2. Price was ok though lower prices are possible!3. Better than the equipment I have mentioned above. No science in figuring that out!4. Came we well packed though I am sure I got a used piece. Multiple tape marks confirmed this. The binos were clean though!Con's:1. Heavy blurring of stars and planets gives a frustrating experience!2. Heavy equipment which may benefit your muscles though! Long time use may surely do neck and back damage. Tripod is a must!3. Lighting around in a metro city messes the overall experienceSetting expectations in a polluted metro:1. Jupiter will be seen a bright white dot with 4 moons seen as fine and faint dots next to it it. Just like a thermocol ball.2. No you can't see the red spot on Jupiter!3. Saturn is the most sought after planet. However it looks white blurred elliptical and like an even smaller thermocol ball. Due to the blurring you have to conclude that the elliptical shape is because of the rings. And no you can't make out the rings clearly!4. The moon is bright as big as the new 10Rs coin. Craters are clear!5. I'm yet to see the galaxies and nebulae so can't comment on it yet.6. You can see other stars that you may not be able to see with the naked eye. In short you see more of the milky way!7. Terrestrial views are fine and you can see good amount of details. My house is 9kms from the airport runway (as-the-crow-flies) and the detailing on the airplane tail is just fine. Easy to make out the airline. Don't expect to see waving passengers at this distance though!What is a must:1. Tripod!!!!! Buy the Photron Stedy Pro 560 and it works like a charm. I got it at a reduced price of 1100 instead of 2950 on Amazon which was even more fantastic. The bino to tripod docking station is plastic but I think it does the job. Reviewers on Amazon USA have suggested a metal dock which would definitely be better than plastic. However you can stick to what you get.2. Google Sky Map on Android is brilliant! Can't track planets and stars without it.3. A good phone that you can focus on the eyepiece to click pictures. Makes silly pics but then can surely show people what you saw! I use the Note 5.4. Painkillers if you go without the tripod for extended viewing.5. Don't wear your cap the other way while viewing else you may be mistaken for a sniper!Pictures:Check the pictures to see how the planets look. Please excuse the blurred white circle (in between which should not be mistaken for some astro object) and also the quality! These pictures are very crude representations of what you see and the real view is slightly better. I still need to test these in a less polluted and lit area and I'm sure they will do their magic!Verdict: You may buy if1. Your expectations are not very high.2. You can wait for reduced prices if not in a hurry. As I type my review these binos are retailing for 10048.3. If you need to buy it Amazon it is!Finally I hope the review helps you make your choice!
5,ReciÃ©n comienzo en esta bonita actividad de ver a los cielos y al ser mi primera compra estoy muy satisfecho. En un viaje a Hidalgo pude ver sin problemas la Nebulosa de OriÃ³n y estrellas que a simple vista no se ven; el detalle de la Luna es muy bueno. Anexo una foto que logrÃ© con estos fantÃ¡sticos prismÃ¡ticos. Recomiendo observar con tripie o acostado en el suelo.
5,Always wanted a pair of really good binoculars but never could justify buying some. Then I saw these and saw their price. They are way higher powered than I ever thought I would buy but the price is really good for what you get. I was gonna get even higher powered ones to see really far but I think the 15x70 are the best as they can see things really far but still keep the weight down to use handheld. I have a tripod as well but only use it if I plan on looking at something for a long time. I suggest you buy one too as it will reduce any sort of shaking by a lot. I bought the Amazon 60 Basics Tripod and it works great and is super cheap yet strong. I also got a stronger L bracket to mount them. They come with one which is decent but a metal one is much better at reducing even more shake. Makes life a lot easier to focus on things when the image is almost totally stable.These can see for miles. Every time I use them it is exciting. It blows my mind just how sharp an image you can see even though it is literally miles away. Farthest thing I saw so far was over 400 million miles away which was Jupiter. It could easily be seen in the sky but the coolest part is you can even see its moons. I never thought I would be able to see either with just binoculars.Things at night are very bright. The large lens let in so much light. I saw a raccoon in a tree and could see he was looking at me. I couldn't even tell there was something there with my normal eyes but could see it in detail with these. They are not actual night vision like it says but they mean you can see much clearer at night than you can with your regular vision. I saw a city at night really far away that could not be seen with the human eye too. It was roughly 40miles away. It was not very clear at that distance and it was night but you could clearly see the lights and the buildings. Was pretty cool.Overall if you live in a place that allows you to see really far I would definitely get these. They are a lot of fun. Once you look out of them for a few minutes it is like another universe seeing so far once you put them down. You will be shocked every time that you could see so far. Really liking them and definitely recommend.
4,For the price this is a good deal but the view is a little more blurry that I would like more pronounced on the right  than the left even with the adjustment to the right eye piece. From the picture you can see the zoom level which is great for watching the boats. I use them at night to look at the stars and they work well. All in all for the price I am happy with the purchase. If you want great optics you will have to pay more but these get the job done.
5,Para alguien que se inicia en la observaciÃ³n del cielo y las estrellas es ADECUADO el aumento 15x70 tiene buen alcance y nitidez a unos 500-900 metros. Es buena para ver la luna las estellas. Yo me sorprendÃ­ que pese al aumento puedes ver aves y aviones en vuelo.Eso si son algo pesados para tenerlos en mano mas de 5min. Yo adquirÃ­ un TRIPODE Neewer de 1.77m yo mido 1.87 y me pareciÃ³ el adecuado para no sufrir del cuello y espalda y quedÃ© fascinado.100% recomendados!!!
3,I followed the instructions for adjustment/calibration both with and without glasses and even with the use of a quality tripod I could never seem to get a steady and clear viewing experience. I couldn't seem to eliminate the chromatic aberration problems no matter how I placed my eyes or adjusted the binoculars. Perhaps I was expecting too much but I just couldn't enjoy these at all. Others may have better luck.
5,No tengo ninguna experiencia en astronomÃ­a y estaba muy indeciso sobre cual telescopio comprar asÃ­ que mejor decidÃ­ adquirir los binoculares Celestron Skymaster 15x70 para empezar a conocer el cielo y estoy muy satisfecho con la elecciÃ³n. Desde la segunda noche pude observar a JÃºpiter con dos lunas y a Saturno. Hay que tener bien claro que los binoculares obviamente no tienen el mismo alcance que un telescopio por lo que los planetas aunque se alcanzan a distinguir solo se ven como puntos un poco mas grandes y brillantes que las estrellas. La luna si se ve con gran detalle y tambiÃ©n se pueden observar muchas estrellas que a simple vista no se ven parece magia.Los binoculares tambiÃ©n son muy disfrutables para observaciones terrestres ya que puedes observar montaÃ±as lejanas con gran detalle y muchas aves en vuelo.Creo que el tripie no es indispensable pero la experiencia de usar los binoculares aumenta MUCHO cuando usas uno. Yo adquirÃ­ el tripie de 60 pulgadas de AmazonBasics que fue recomendado por la misma pagina al momento de hacer la compra y creo que es ideal y a un precio muy razonable. La altura mÃ¡xima que da ya con los binoculares instalados es de aproximadamente 1.70m.  (yo mido 1.74 y me quedo perfecto)Sin duda voy a adquirir un telescopio de la marca Celestron en el futuro u otros binoculares!
5,La compra hecha a Amazon E.U fue excelente el producto llegÃ³ bien empacando y en buenas condiciones. Los vinoculares son muy buenos alcanza a visualizar con gran detalle objetos medianos a una gran distancia con una alta nitidez perfecto para distancias de 2 4 y un poco quiza hasta 6 kilometros obvio ajustando los a cada objeto a ver y de su distancia a que se encuentre. En ese rango logras ver con nitidez muy bien objetos medianos y grandes aunque objetos chicos si se ven bien pero un poquito difusos quiza por que yo siempre los he visualizado con un poco de niveles y un ambiente brumoso. Mi uso principal ha sido utilizarlo para seguir a mi Drone Phantom y entre esas distancias que lo he usado han sido los vinoculares de mucha ayuda para ver cÃ³mo vuela dicho Drone si lo alcanzÃ³ a ver pero sugiero utilizar un trÃ­pode o una base de sustentaciÃ³n por que hacerlo solo con las manos te va costar un poco de trabajo hacerlo se puede si pero cuenta un poco de trabajo.Con dichos vinoculares ajustando bien cada objeto que vas a ver logras hacer muy buenas vistas de objetos que literalmente con el ojo humano apenas los ves a la distancia pero ya con ayuda de dichos vinoculares logras verlos con detalle al igual que descubres cosas que no habÃ­as percibido. Para paisajes estupendos.Nota.Recomiendo usarlos con un trÃ­pode para sacarles mayor provecho para objetos a ver en especÃ­fico a una gran distancia.
4,Having read these reviews I knew there was a good chance my first pair would be out of collimation (ie: seeing double). Sure enough they were really bad. Even after adjusting them the double vision was unbearable. So I returned them and thankfully the second pair was well collimated.The lens quality seems very good - things look very sharp. The magnification is much more than I expected which I love. I think any more magnification and a tripod would be a must. Another thing that is very impressive is night time viewing. I can point the bins to a very dark area of the city and it lights up - I see all sorts of things that are completely invisible to the naked eye. The moon also looks absolutely amazing - it's bright and full of detail. For $115 these are so worth it. The case is flimsy and I would never trust the neck strap but that doesn't really bother me. They are quite heavy but I have no problem using them for minutes at a time without a tripod.
5,Aunque sufren un poco de aberraciÃ³n cromÃ¡tica obtienes un muy buen producto a un bajo precio. Los crÃ¡teres de la luna se ven a muy bien e incluso 2 de las lunas de jupiter aÃºn con la contaminaciÃ³n lumÃ­nica  de la ciudad. Aunque el trÃ­pode no es necesario definitivamente ayuda bastante. TambiÃ©n funcionan bien para ver aves.
5,very large relatively stable. best for distance with a tripod. get the metal adapter its better for stability than the plastic one that it comes with. case is flimsy and junky though.
5,The binocular is very good for the price I have just got it so I-didn't try it at night yet but in daylight its a superb magnification! Everything is well packaged it came with everything said it will all wrapped nicely delivery is super fast! You will have to have a tripod with it though because it is fairly big so you will not be able to hold it just in your hand. It came with the attachment to hook it to a tripod. I had 2 tripods so it  goes well without any problem. Now I hardly can wait the sky to clear so I can look at some stars with it.  Great buy!
5,These have been a fantastic investment. The moon is a neighbourhood favourite. Set up on a tripod in my driveway everyone stops by for a look at the beautiful lunar surface. It's astounding how bright and clear it is. Through winter I was lucky enough to catch 4 of Jupiters moons and I could even just make out Saturns rings. Buying these is just sparking the beginning of aided night-sky viewing - but the price was a perfect starting point and we'll use them for many years to come. I recommend a sturdy tripod although its not always necessary.
5,I bought these for stargazing using a tripod and they work very well particularly at this price point. The most obvious shortcoming of the optics is a definite softening of the focus at the edges of the field of view. I have used them during the day handheld and they are easier to handle than I had expected though I wouldnât want to carry them around for hours. The bright 15x image in daylight is impressive.
5,first pair of big binoculars - they are large and may be hard to hold with arms for a long period of time super good with a tripod. Have only had one good night of viewing due to inclement weather but I really enjoyed the brief time with these.
5,The optics seem good to me at this price point. I'm no expert but the alignment seems good as well. They are sufficiently bright with just slight chromatic aberration showing up as colour fringing. Comfort and weight comment is in reference to hand held use. At this power  either a brace against a fixed object or tripod would be advisable.  I'm pleased with them.A later note: Chromatic aberration has become more noticeable but that may have to do with particular light conditions.
2,These are good binoculars for looking at the Moon. You can see the four biggest moons of Jupiter as dots. You can see that Mars and Jupiter are disks not points of light. However that's it. Both Jupiter and Mars are smears of light. Chromatic aberration is a problem with all refracting telescopes but I was hoping for better.
4,Buy a tripod. Don't let anyone fool you into thinking you dont need one. I'm new at this and realize with the strength of the magnification i have to really let my eyes relax and take in what im looking at.  It hard to do that when trying to hold the binoculars steady.  I've been watching Jupitor... This binoculars it will show it as a bright star with a red hue (no details).  U can also spot 4 moons as smaller stars to the left and right.  Its still quite breath taking.  The moon looks phenomenal with all details but again... Without a tripod u cant focus ur eyes on the details.
1,Los binoculares se compraron en Amazon en 2015.El problema que tienen estos binoculares es que hacen un ruido de âcascabeleoâ indicando que hay algo suelto dentro de ellos.  Al apuntar hacia el cielo con ellos una especie de laminilla metÃ¡lica cae hacia uno de los lentes de 70mm por adentro del tubo.  Dicha laminilla golpea la cara interna de uno de los lentes de 70mm y no hay forma de evitar eso al usar los binocularesCabe mencionar que estos binoculares casi no se han usado debido que en la ciudad la contaminaciÃ³n lumÃ­nica es muy fuerte. Siempre se han mantenido protegidos en un estuche rÃ­gido âPelicanâ.  Lo Ãºnico que podrÃ­a explicar el problema es que su calidad de construcciÃ³n no es muy buena.Â¿Alguien sabe cÃ³mo hacer valida la garantÃ­a despuÃ©s del tiempo transcurrido desde su compra?
3,Good product but possibly a bit delicate. Dropped it a couple feet once and the lenses when out of whack. But with some twisting of the casing brought the lenses back in line and still use it. No vision issues. Good for the money. Brother has one with no issues. Reasonable pair of binoculars for the money.
5,Son unos prismÃ¡ticos de muy buena calidad y con gran alcance el costo me pareciÃ³ justo. SÃ³lo hay que tener en cuenta que es necesario un trÃ­pode que soporte sin problemas unos 3 kilos de peso ya que con uno que soporte menos las vibraciones son muy molestas.
4,These binoculars are great for astronomical viewing! I would reccomend these to anyone that needs a decent set of binoculars for viewing the Stars or for bird watching as well. The one complaint I have is that my binoculars came with the tripod mount but not the screw part of the mount that screws into the binoculars! I was dissapointed about that so i have to take one star away. But other then that these are great!
5,Si estÃ¡s iniciando en esto de ver las estrellas son los mejores prismÃ¡ticos que puedes comprar.EstÃ©ticos fÃ¡ciles de usar y muy resistentes de excelentes materiales.Es el tamaÃ±o perfecto para ver estrellas y portarlos a cualquier lugar fÃ¡cilmente.Aunque hay que mencionar que el trÃ­pode si es necesario para una mejor experiencia. Recomiendo el trÃ­pode de Amazon Basics.
4,happy with the purchase.  the binoculars give a decent view about 18km away ( ie you can see logos on buildings)have used it for birds.. havent used it for star gazing.bought the tripod for it as well.decent price for a good set of binoculars..
5,These were recommended by a member of my local astronomy club. I purchase these binoculars after a chance of using them on stargazing night. The view is crisp and clear. I would highly recommend a tripod if you are doing any extended stargazing it is a bit on the heavy side when it comes to the weight of these binoculars other than that I love this binoculars!
5,I'm very impressed at the clarity of the image. There are some purple/greenish fringe around shiny objects again plain sky backdrop probably due to the fact that they don't use aspherical lens on binoculars of this price but that doesn't bother me much. Overall I'm pleased with the purchase. Also I'm thinking of upgrading to the 25x100 soon.
5,Estoy muy contento con mi compra con los binoculares pude ver objetos terrestres hasta a 10 km de distancia y algunos aviones que pasan cerca de mi casa sin embargo por el tamaÃ±o y peso se requiere un tripode para poder observar mejor. TambiÃ©n los he usado para observaciÃ³n astronÃ³mica he visto varias constelaciones y cÃºmulos de estrellas asÃ­ como satÃ©lites orbitando. Los recomiendo ampliamente. Respecto al envÃ­o que fue por DHL me llegaron en 5 dÃ­as.
5,I use these binoculars for astronomy. They are the perfect size for viewing starfields and the moon. Not too heavy but a tripod makes longer viewing times more comfortable. They are great for bird watching and whale watching etc. Delivered promptly by Amazon. Great value for the price.
4,Its Good nothing wrong  nothing special eitherComes with a decent case and lens protecting caps.At times this is all you need in a product just works :)
2,Very first pair of binoculars Iâm hoping to get into astronomy but this pair arrived today and one side twisted off already... the glue on the screw was still gooey. Not sure if this is supposed to happen?Also the instruction manual says thereâs a zoom lever but itâs not actually on the binocular... considering a return/refund
1,No logro ajustarlos al 100% he tenido otros binoculares y estos son los menos ajustables incluso sospecho que tengan algÃºn tipo de imperfecciÃ³n de fÃ¡brica.
5,Lo que se puede ver es impresionante recomendable 100%. Se necesita trÃ­pode obligatoriamente para sacarle el mÃ¡ximo provecho. Vivo en una zona con mucha contaminaciÃ³n lumÃ­nica y aÃºn asÃ­ se pueden ver objetos muy difusos; quÃ© decir de la Luna que se nota con mucho detalle. Adjunto algunas fotos que he tomado. El de la nebulosa de Orion es lo que pude ver respecto a cÃ³mo es en realidad los colores se llegan a notar.
5,These are great I'm fairly new to this but amazing you can see the sky so clearly. Mounts on tripod which is great. Bit too heavy for me as a handheld. I might sell these and get smaller ones but it's great for tripod stargazing.
4,Purchased these for my husband to look at satellites and other celestial objects. They work well for the price. We attached a monopod to them to help steady the view. Very clear. I find them great to watch wild life.  The case is not the greatest but that is not important to us.  Ordered late Friday night received them first thing Monday morning.
1,Don't waste your time on these.  Yes you will get your money back from Amazon and all it will cost you is time.  But if you want a good set of binoculars they will cost more than 99.00 so think before you push the button.Or if you like double vision buy them.
5,Very clear and crisp binoculars for the price. The magnification is substantial and brings things much closer than most binoculars so great value for the money
5,nice and clear leave in side - side for hunting the magnification is what I need  for hunting moose here because of the size restriction on antlers also bets looking through spotting scope all day
4,Haven't had much  chance to use them at night yet but I'm happy with them so far. The only criticism I have is the eye piece cover didn't  come with a tethering strap.
4,No lo he utilizado ni he abierto la caja lo quiero para regalar en navidad lo conseguÃ­ a un excelente precio. LlegÃ³ 2 dias depues de la fecha programada quizÃ¡ por la temporada.Mas adelante cuando mis hijas lo usen actualizo este comentario
5,I haven't had much chance to use the binoculars.  They are definitely  front end heavy and need a rugged tripod.  Short period of ha don't held I watched an eagle soaring looking for fish. They allowed me to see windmills across  water 20 miles away which were not visible with the  naked eye.
4,EstÃ¡n muy bien tienen muy buena calidad excepto por el soporte del tripiÃ© es de plÃ¡stico por ello una estrella menos el soporte hace que vibre y se mueve deberÃ­a ser de metal
5,These are amazing binocs!  Day or Night they bring the world into focus.  Affordable too!  Thank you Celestron.
3,The binoculars are quite heavy I could not hold them to my face for more than a few minutes at a time. The quality of focus was pretty decent for how much it cost.
4,These binoculars seem to be a good quality for the price. I wanted a set to look at the sky without paying out a lot of money.  I had bought a cheaper set of binoculars but was not happy with them and returned them. I ordered these instead which were more expensive but what a difference. I am happy with my purchase.
4,El producto es muy bueno con una excelente relacion calidad-precio. Lo que no me gusto fuÃ© que evidentemente no era un producto nuevo sino que es de los que regresan y ni siquiera venia bien empacado. Amazon deberia tener mas cuidado en estos detalles. Aun lo estoy probando.
5,I live on the 16th floor overlooking the river - it's constantly active and these binoculars are fantastic just what I needed.  They are very powerful and quite weighty - I mounted them on a full sized tripod and that's been great much easier to use and the performance is much better.  Awesome ;)
5,Me gustÃ³ mucho tiene imÃ¡genes muy nÃ­tidas y es muy Ãºtil para ver el cielo. No me gustÃ³ la calidad de la correa la mochilita que te agregan se agradece el adaptador para trÃ­pode se mueve un poco pero estÃ¡ bien. DespuÃ©s de un rato cansan debido al peso por lo que se recomienda el uso del trÃ­pode.
4,Fantastic binos. Very high end. MUST have tripod. The vision is strong you can't hold them in your hands because they rest to ANY movement. I should have done more research. Should have purchased lesser magnification.
5,Definitivamente lo mejor que he probado por ese precio. Yo lo agarrÃ© en oferta y vaya que he disfrutado observando el cielo con Ã©stos binoculares. Solo una cosa tienes que usar sÃ­ o sÃ­ un trÃ­pode.LogrÃ© fotos humildes usando un celular y los 15x70. Me parecen geniales.
5,Absolitely mazing binos. Clearly seen the moons of saturn with these.Advise. Do not drop
5,Llegaron antes de lo esperado y en perfectas condiciones con todos sus accesorios. Y son perfectos para el uso astronÃ³mico. Pueden verse objetos de espacio profundo como la galaxia de AndrÃ³meda o la nebulosa de OriÃ³n sin problemas e incluso es posible distinguir las lunas de JÃºpiter.
1,Super low contrast lots of chromatic aberration and not sharp. Honestly just not impressive at all.
3,3rd pair received first from hobby shop but first 2 WAY out of collimatiion 3rd set still out of collimatiion but havenât yet decided if return and try again or collimatebmyself which entails tearing off rubber grip to get to screws
4,They said it comes with a triopod mount and it did not.So far the moon is amazing! but you need a tripod if you want to look at the stars :) other wise it's to shaky and I dont have surgeon hand to keep that 7lb steady.But so far I'm very happy.
5,We are very happy with the clarity and ability to see stars.
4,Very Nice and Good Quality Build  Very Clear Great Product. Highly Recommend This Product
5,Los binoculares estÃ¡n padrÃ­simoson de gran tamaÃ±o y muy resistentes la luna se ve con gran detalle ciertamente  todo se ve con mucha claridad.
5,A pesar de ser algo pesados tienen muy buena calidad y buen zoom perfectos para astronomÃ­a. Son perfectos para ver la luna o la estaciÃ³n espacial con bastante detalle. Y aunque es posible ver JÃºpiter o Marte con ellos no lo recomendarÃ­a se ven muy pequeÃ±os
2,The magnification was good on these. But the focus was terrible. I have a pair of old Tasco 7x35 with much better focus . I'm not sure if it is just this particular pair or an inferior product. Regardless I am going to return them. I'm not sure if I am going to try another Celestron pair or not .
4,Pour tout les amateurs d'astronomie vous devez en premier lieux considÃ©rer un trÃ©pied et les jumelles doivent avoir une barre stabilisatrice au centre. Avec les 15x70 c'est tout simplement impossible de garder le focus.
4,The collimation was out when I received them but fortunately that can be adjusted via the two tiny screws underneath the right hand grip.These binoculars offer a terrific view of the moon the bright planets and the Galilean satellites.
5,No issues with usage and you ca see craters on the moon. I like it even thou it is heavy but surprisingly does not make my arms tired
5,eS UN producto que recomiendo ampliamente..los uso para ver la luna y el cielo y creanme que los disfruto cada que los uso..tienen muy  buen alcance y para iniciarse en el mundo de la astronomia son excelentes..mejor que algunos telescopios
4,It's fine no assembly required.  The tripod adapter that came with it was inferior and put the binoculars at risk of falling off a tripod.
4,Excelente a producto. Se aprecian muy bien los paisajes lejanos volcanes plantas pÃ¡jaros...  Cabe destacar que la Luna se ve de gran calidad. Son unos excelente binoculares no te arrepentirÃ¡s.
5,Muy buena calidad de imagen lamentablemente el adaptador tiene Ã¡reas de oportunidad ya que el que viene con los binoculares es de plÃ¡stico y el que adquieres adicional auqnue es metÃ¡lico el ajuste del tornillo es muy incÃ³modo.
5,Donne de belles vues et câest encore plus vrai avec un tripied surtout pour observer les Ã©toiles
5,Investigue varios modelos de binoculares al final este modelo lo seleccione por sus caracterÃ­sticas. Me gusta como se ve la luna con ellos.
5,Fue un regalo me dicen que esta excelente y les encanto
4,Great value. Does not auto-focus of course. A little chunky but great optics. Can recommend!
5,The focus works very well and doesn't wander just by holding them to your face like my last set of binoculars with the rocker style focus "knob".
5,Binoculares potentes  buena calidad por el costo el detalle es que si es necesario un trÃ­pode por que con el pulso tiembla la imagen y por el tAmaÃ±o ocupa casi toda la mochila
2,Bought for stargazing. First one wouldnât focus correctly replacement came fast but ultimately too hard to hold still (even with lightweight tripod) so I returned it and bought ânormal lookingâ 10x50s that are much more versatile.
5,Excellent binos exactly as advertised. They have a good weight to them and are great for stargazing or for nature watching. Would buy again.
5,Extremely happy! Very good quality for the price! Was a gift and the person is a bird watcher and lives it. Thank you!
5,TrÃ¨s bonne jumelle quand mÃªme assez lÃ©ger et confortable vu la dimension et les lentille sont de bonne qualitÃ©
5,Very powerfulIts more than a bargain at that price.
5,EL PRODUCTO VIENE EMPACADO CUIDADOSAMENTE LA ENTREGA FUE ANTES DE LO ESPERADO Y ESTOY SATISFECHA CON LOS BINOCULARES TIENE EXCELENTE CALIDAD EN LOS ACABADOS ES UNA MARCA TOTALMENTE RECOMENDABLE.
4,Only knock on the product would be the large heavy size but for the money works nice...and durable.
5,Excellent long range heavy duty binoculars.Not intended for walk around casual viewing unless you have rock steady heavy duty arms.
5,Excelentes binoculares puedes observar la luna y las estrellas sin problemas siempre y cuando no haya nubes claro estÃ¡ pero son una muy buena adquisiciÃ³n
1,It is too heavytoo bulky and the quality is not great. There were some dents on the strap clip just like somebody used it before. I don't like the  exprience at all. I am going to return it today.
5,Very solid construction. Very good vision with high definition. Amazingly good for the price.
5,Good quality. A little heavy but what do you expect for this size. Comes with a nice case.
5,Using these binoculars to check out the skyline and birds - great product for that.
1,Took it on an Alaska cruise and an inside lens popped out. Can't return so I'm out $125. Should have bought at a store where I could take it back for exchange or refund.
5,ComprÃ© unos binoculares celestron para un regalo y estoy satisfecho por el tiempo de entrega y el producto venÃ­a muy bien embalado completamente nuevo y funcionan muy bien.
5,Estos 15X70 son mas que excelentes por el precio en el comparativo con los de 25x70 no le piden nada estos 15X70 y si me ahorre una buenas suma y son un poco mas ligeros.
4,Excellent optics good finish the strap is very cheap. It cheapens the whole item. I wish they offered an optional better more comfortable strap..after all this monsters are heavy!!!!!
5,My son is very pleased with the binoculars
1,Cancelaron mi pedido despuÃ©s de 15 dÃ­as de haberlo hecho explicando que el provedor no lo surtiÃ³ me devolvieron el pago sin problema pero si estuve esperando en vano...
5,They are bigger than I expected.Work perfectly and clarity is pretty good.
5,El producto llegÃ³ muy rÃ¡pido y en excelente estado muy contento con el servicio se ve muy nÃ­tido y el peso no es mucho problema.Buena forma de iniciar el aÃ±o :)
5,Bought for my husband.  They are a little heavy but to be expected.  Arrived on time and great viewing pleasure.
5,Great product. I ended up using a tripod and purchasing a phone adapter. Kids are loving it.
3,Fulfills the requirements that I have. A tad heavy best to use it with a tripod when using continuously for more than a few minutes
5,Awesome unit for watching the night sky or even the birds across the field in trees.A little on the heavy side but I expected that.
4,Llegaron con los sellos de Amazon violados y con una cinta transparente sobrepuesta para que no luzca abierto.Lo chequÃ© a detalle y afortunadamente llegaron completos y sin daÃ±os.SÃ³lo fue un susto que no pasÃ³ a mayores.
5,I gave this as a gift to my son - who loves it !!!  He did say it was a wee bit heavy - but not a real issue.
5,Second pair now. Too heavy to carry all day but great for in the blind or similar permanent set up. more versatile than a spotting scope.
4,Comfortable on eyes even with prescription eyeglasses
5,Excelente producto muy buena calidad  tiene unas Ã³pticas excelentes
5,Perfectamente conforme los uso para observacion del cielo y para cielo profundo en campo amplio son geniales!
5,very good productat a good price.With them we can see much more then 5 stars.
1,No llego completo falta la cinta para colgar el tapon para cubrir el tornillo del tripiÃ© la tela para limpiar y no puedo asegurar que sea completamente nuevo.
5,Love it. Great for stargazing and moon observing. I live in very light poluted city and I am still able to see a lot of stars.
5,Es una gran compra si lo utilizan para observar en lapsos lados de tiempo serÃ¡ necesario un tripie. Estoy muy satisfecho con la compra.
5,Excelente opciÃ³n para astronomÃ­a que es para lo que los adquirÃ­ estoy muy satisfecho con la compra...
4,These are awesome binoculars! I love them!  My only complaint is the adapter. You will need to purchase better tripod adapter to stabilize them as they are quite heavy. The plastic one supplied is just too weak.
5,Great distance
5,Excelente producto llego a tiempo sumamente importante usar Tripie (trÃ­pode) de lo contrario es imposible ver algo con claridad
5,best
5,my First Celeston it looks like a pretty well built stuff. I am learning more about binoculars and I think this would is a good choice.
4,Es un muy buen producto ahora esperar unas noche despejada para usarlos como se debe A y solo unos detalles estÃ©ticos pero nada grave. Respecto al enviÃ³ muy bueno llego una semana antes de lo pactado
5,For the price they worked great easy zoom in and out
5,Excelente producto en realidad si se puede ver todo sin ningÃºn problema son grandes y un poco pesados pero no es nada vale la pena.
5,With this magnification a tripod is a must.  While sky viewing I was able to catch 3 of Jupiter's moons
1,Good Binoculars but it does not include the tripod adapter.
5,Not as heavy as I expected them to be.
4,Works better than I expected.Now able to get some great views across the water looking at the cruise ships as they pass by.
4,Seems to be a good product. Clear view shipped quickly. Way better price than I could get locally.
4,Un beau cadeau ...
5,Great for viewing birds and the moon.
5,Fantastic. Works much better than anticipated.
4,Solidly made well packaged works very well and impressive for the cost!
5,Very good product. Clear view not to heavy. Easy to use. Very good product for the price.
5,Llegaron a tiempo y en forma muy buenos para iniciarse en el mundo de la astronomÃ­a.
2,They were not manufactured  properly like my previous same binoculats so almost impossible to focus.
5,I can see into the future with these. They are awesome. Shipped so quickly and not as heavy as the reviews of it suggest. They are HUGE though.
4,pretty big and heavy
5,These bin are very powerful just what i wanted for my night sky use.a little heavy though!Dave
5,These are great nocs for the money. Very hardy and nice accesories
5,perfect for price!

5,AchetÃ© pour regarder les animaux dans la nature.
4,Vision is little blury..other wise fine
5,Son muy buenos  binoculares no soy profesional y he hecho algunas fotos muy buenas.
4,Larger than I expected but does the job.  Glad I've got a tripod.
5,Great product for the price.
3,I don't have money for high end optics but these do nicely for seeing more stars and scanning river valleys for wildlife
5,Me han gustado mucho muy recomendables y buen precio. Son todo lo q esperaba!!
5,Buena claridad y peso para manejar en trÃ­pode. La construcciÃ³n lo hace Ãºtil en todos los climas.
3,Thought distance would be closer but good vision works well at night. Big and bulky.
5,Entrega rÃ¡pida y bien protegida todo en orden y se ven excelente.Totalmente satisfecha.
2,The binoculars zoom dial broke after few weeks of use I am disappointed
4,Great inexpensive alternative to a telescope and one thing you should like purchase prior to a scope.  The tri-pod adapter is a bit weak but with a bit of epoxy in the hollows to tighten up the mount is enough to make it worthwhile.
5,muy buena calidad a un bajo costo los recomiendo ampliamente.
5,thanks
5,Was what I ordered
5,excellent and great value
5,What a great deal for theses binoculars!  They are fantastic!  The range and clarity are really good for a set of binoculars that are under $100!!

5,Great product.
4,I like the fact that Celestron goes the extra mile to ensure their product arrives in one piece these bino's were well packaged. I did a fair amount of review reading before purchasing these as I was moving up from an older pair of Tasco Zip fully coated10x50  and I wanted to make sure I was going to be happy with the purchase as I hate sending anything back. Well as luck would have it these bino's were out of collimation and that was a definite bummer but a quick check on the net produced several vids on what to do to fix the problem. Now I was a little hesitant to pry up the rubber to get at the adjustment screws but the rubber coating came up simply enough and gave full access to the screw that I need to adjust. I only had to adjust the screw a 1/4 turn to get the images back into alignment if you turn the screw the wrong way and look through the bino's it will be very evident it needs to be turned in the opposite direction.In my case the screw that needed adjustment was just above the "M" in the name SkyMaster on the left side of the bino under the rubber it is a common"flathead" screw you will need a small precision screwdriver to fit and it may possibly help you to use a set of vice-grips on the screwdriver to get a good enough grip to be able to turn the screw.Once I had the bino's back in collimation the view was excellent and a nice improvement over my 10x50's. Having the 70mm lenses helps bring in additional light for viewing early morn or later in the evening. As you can imagine they are a bit heavier but not bad for holding for short periods.
4,It must be said from the start that these are specialist binoculars and are  aimed at astronomical and long range terrestrial use. Using them mounted in some way is a must or it is pointless owning them. I will assume the user is familiar with setting up the right-hand  dioptre eyepiece.Optical Quality:For Â£75 these are excellent optical quality. Obviously because of the high power and price paid you cannot expect pin-sharp images and with most binoculars in this price range there is some chromatic aberration (coloured edges around bright images) and a little distortion at the edges of the field of view. However this in no way detracts from the pleasure of using them.  Full correction of this would take us into professional prices i.e. thousands. The 15x70 specification is ideal for stars. Remember image brightness is (exit pupil diameter)^2 . That is (70/15)^2. The exit pupil diameter of these is large and also permits the use of prescription glasses if you fold down the rubber eye cups. That is the reason I chose 15x70 and not the 20x80 model.Mechanical Quality:The focus is smooth and the mechanical design allows plenty of thumb wheel movement throughout the focus. A great help.I would have  liked to have seen a ridged stabilising bridge across the ends of the objective barrels. The collimation of my pair was slightly out causing me to see two slightly over lapping images of the Moon for example. This is the risk of long focal length binoculars with long barrels. Any slight knock will de-collimate them particularly during manual handling and mounting. Lucky for me I found I could correct for this by folding a clean kitchen sponge and squeezing it between the ends of the object barrels. That just shows how sensitive the collimation is. But once corrected the Moon and its craters leaped out at me as almost 3D!The binoculars  do come with a soft carrying case but I would recommend purchasing an aluminium instrument carrying case with foam inserts. This can also be used for safe storage. Personally I would not risk walking about with them in the softcase.Using:I would recommend experience with small and lower powered binoculars before deciding to purchase these. Although they are actually quite light for their size they are bulky. Using them hand-held is a sad waste of their potential. Hand-holding also raises the risk of knocks. The binoculars do come with a tripod adapter. However I found a standard camera tripod hopeless. The binoculars are too heavy and because their centre of gravity is beyond the tripod pivot point and towards the objectives they will crash downwards at the slightest loosing of the tripod pan head. There is also a risk of the whole tripod falling over. I suggest you use a heavy-duty telescope type tripod and NOT one for digital cameras. Or I found I could get away with a heavy-duty mono pod though not ideal.Remember if using a tripod think how you are going to view the sky overhead. Standard heavy-duty tripod mounting is great for terrestrial use but breaks your neck looking upwards.The tripod adapter itself will not clamp the binoculars securely enough. The screw of the adapter  is the standard tripod 1/4" UNC and is not of sufficient diameter to clamp securely enough to prevent the weight of the binoculars twisting and yawing while in use. Also the height of the adapter causes the binoculars to vibrate. Personally I have decided to make my own cantilever mount via a heavy-duty telescope tripod. There are many designs out there on the internet. However deciding to purchase one will set you back about 3x the cost the binoculars.Remember the more comfortable you are the more you will see. Standing while viewing is not comfortable long term so a lounger or deck chair is a good idea. Also that way the tripod does not have to be fully extended and so is more stable.SummaryThe views of the Milky Way with these binoculars are breathtaking. In this they exceed the views from my large expensive telescope which cannot be used with low magnifications. Such a telescope will no where will match the field of view of these binoculars or the feeling of actually being out there amongst the stars that these binoculars give you. Overall I am very pleased with my purchase. I will update tis with a photo of my DIY mount when complete.
4,Great binoculars! They take a while to get used to with such high magnification. They aren't overly heavy as some people have mentioned. A tripod helps to steady your view but it isn't necessary. Simply brace yourself against and object and enjoy staring out across the country or up into the night sky. This won't make celestial objects appear at an incredible size but it makes the moon look bigger for sure. Guests love them as well and are impressed with the view. They are fun but if you plan on stargazing get a telescope.
5,Donât expect wonders of clarity but considering the price itâs a very decent bino.
2,Update June 2020These binoculars are out of culmination again. They have been in a drawer sitting largely unused. They seem to be very delicate and easy to knock out of focus. Iâve not dropped them or bumped them in any serious sense rumbling along in a back pack or a bumpy road seems to be all it takes.Iâm really disappointed in these and how delicate they are. I have an old pair of Bushnell binoculars that have been through the ringer and are still spot on. Waiting for Celestron customer support to call me back.*******These are great! My first pair came out of culmination but Amazon made it an easy return. My new pair are working great.The moon is amazing with these and you can easily see the shape and rings of other planets.Like others have mentioned they are a little heavy so a tripod is a must.One negative is the tripod attachment is cheap and mine has already broken. First the knob for screwing it on and off broke then finally the whole screw assembley feel out. Frustrating but not a deal breaker. I mcgyvered a solution and it works. (I haven't contacted Celestron about this issue maybe they would replace it)All in all a really great product.
5,These binoculars are amazing!  Everyone wanted to try them out - they couldn't wait for the view!  The reviews that were posted for these binoculars definitely were accurate.
5,So glad I finally made this purchase...wish I had done it long time ago.  These binoculars are "stellar"  The clarity is brilliant.  Shipping was quick and item was well packaged.  Really...everything good to say.  If you are considering them I say...go for it.  Very happy with this purchase.
5,These were a birthday gift for my husband. We're both very happy with these binoculars. It was a simple task to attach them to an existing tripod with the enclosed attachment. Now we're waiting for a clear night!
5,These are the first set of Binoculars I've owned for looking at the night sky and I can't believe how clear objects are in this. Looking at the moon with this is amazing. The fact it also has a tripod adaptor included in the purchase makes this an incredible value.
5,Everything you'd hope for.  White they're a tad heavy what would you expect from large binoculars.  They won't focus out till about 20 meters so if you want to look at close up you'll need something with less magnification
5,Mein erste Fernglas fÃ¼r himmel beobachtung und ich hatte glÃ¼ck sowas geiles ich dÃ¼rfte in der erste nacht mit eigene Augen jupliters drei monde sehen ich war kurz vor weinen bei saturn erkennt man sogar leicht die ring und mars als rote scheibe und zum schluss andromeda m31 galaxy war als leichte elipse formige wolken fleck zu sehen .Ich bin in der praktisch anfÃ¤nger aber ich sag mal als einsteiger richtung teleskop um die preis richtig super teil ich hatte immer richtig schÃ¶ne glas klare blick ohne irgendwelche farb oder schÃ¤rfe fehler nur was ihr unbedingt mit haben must ist ein stativ in sehr gute qualitÃ¤t.
5,It is clear and useful.
4,Mine was in collmination when ti arrives. Time will tell if it stays that way.I like it so I'll give it 4 stars. Don't expect APO color correction you will get CA with bright objects like Jupiter. For the price these are good for grab and go.
1,Terrible quality.  Eye piece falls off.  Celestron used to be a top brand and now is just a poor excuse for another "has been" company.  Shame on Celestron for destroying a great brand with poor quality.
5,Great bino' sand great experience with the purchase. Came 3 days before the initial expected date
5,nice quality
5,Love them
5,These are great large binoculars.
3,The lens are not very clear. Charges are very high compare to product.
5,Cheap and nasty solution but works fine.
5,Works great can't get anything better for that price and didn't take long to get to me
3,Teil drei:Heute nun kam das Fernglas vom Baader Service zurÃ¼ck. In der E-Mail dazu steht dann:"Die Reparatur war eine Standartprozedur .... (hier stand etwas zur Ursachenvermutung)..... Jedoch zeigt nun das Glas keine Doppelbilder."Ich finde den Baader Service ganz exzellent und die E-Mail Bearbeitung - wie bei Amazon- lobend erwÃ¤hnenswert!Heute werden wir versuchen das Glas zu testen und dann schnellstmÃ¶glich die Bewertung der derzeitigen RealtitÃ¤t anzupassen.Weiter in KÃ¼rze ....Als wir nun das Glas einige Monate in unterschiedlichsten Situationen testen konnten haben wir unseren Eindruck etwas revidieren kÃ¶nnen.Bei guten LichtverhÃ¤ltnissen ist es gut zur ornitologischen Nutzung geeignet.Leider sind ab dem halben Durchmesser der Linsen starke SchÃ¤rfeabnahme und teilweise sogar eine gewisse UnschÃ¤rfe zu beobachten.Also kein Vergleich zu GlÃ¤sern aus der ehemaligen DDR und heutigen GlÃ¤sern der Mittelklasse.Aber es kostet ja auch nur ca. 1/3 des Preises. Die DDR GlÃ¤ser ab Baujahr 1982/83 sind diesem Glas ganz eindeutig weit Ã¼berlegen.Selbst der kleinere Durchmesser von "nur" 50mm schmÃ¤lert diesen Eindruck nicht.Als wir nachts zum Starhopping zogen nahmen wir es ebenfalls mit. Wie schon gesagt im Kernbereich (ca.1/3tel des Durchmessers) sind recht anstÃ¤ndige SchÃ¤rfeleistungen zu erhalten. GroÃe Objekte wie der Mond und Planeten usw. sind damit durchaus ein sehr lohnendes Ziel.Und vielleicht kommt ja mal ein neuer Hale-Bopp vorbei ....  ;o)Aber ab der GrÃ¶Ãe von Kugelsternhaufen ist das AuflÃ¶sungsverhalten an seine Grenzen gestoÃen. Aber zB. M13 als hellster Kugelsternhaufen des Nordhimmels (Sternbild Herkules) ist noch "ansehnlich" !Wenn man an einem Ort mit sehr! geringer Lichtverschmutzung beobachten darf so ist es dennoch ein Erlebnis. Am besten IMMER mit Stativ oder mit einer astronomischen Fernglashalterung.(http://www.amazon.de/Orion-Paragon-Plus-Halterung--Stativ-f%C3%BCr-Ferngl%C3%A4ser/dp/B003YJPDN8/ref=sr_1_4?s=ce-de&ie=UTF8&qid=1392065922&sr=1-4&keywords=Fernglashalterungg)Bei der Jagd ist es auch ein nettes Glas und beim ruhigen Beobachten beim angeln von Land aus mit Bruststativ ein nettes Erlebnis! (http://www.amazon.de/Cullmann-Magic-Chestpod-Videostativ-Schnellkupplungseinheit/dp/B0045HNL14/ref=sr_1_2?s=ce-de&ie=UTF8&qid=1392065868&sr=1-2&keywords=Bruststativ)Diese Halterung sollte man auch unbedingt dazu kaufen. Sie ist aus Metall und ausreichend stabil!(http://www.amazon.de/Seben-Fernglas-Stativ-Adapter-Version/dp/B00693ARYQ/ref=cm_cr-mr-title)Also ich habe den Kauf nicht bereut und kann es dem Beobachter mit schmalem Geldbeutel durchaus empfehlen!Nur sollte man bei Amazon etwas mehr Wert auf Kontrolle UND den eigenen QualitÃ¤tsanspruch lenken !!!!-----------------------------------Teil zwei:Nachdem wir das Glas als dejustiert bemÃ¤ngelten baten wir Amazon um ein NEUES Glas welches in einem 1a Neu-Zustand ist. DafÃ¼r bezahle ich ja ein NeugerÃ¤t.Also sendete Amazon uns wie gewohnt in Windeseile ein Austauschglas.Mit viel Enthusiasmus Ã¶ffneten wir das Paket und sahen beim auspacken ... es ist scheinbar ein RÃ¼cklÃ¤ufer an dem zu unserem Erstaunen schon jemand selbst âprobiertâ hatte. Das sah man an der FarbabschÃ¼rfung an der rechten oberen Glasseite. Dort wo wohl die Einstellschrauben (laut Rezensionsbeitrag von Uwe Pilz) zu finden sind und an der Einpackung des Glases. Wir wuÃten ja wie das Glas originalverpackt war aus der ersten Zusendung.Das grÃ¤mte mich natÃ¼rlich schon ein wenig. Wir hatten ja explizit ein NEUES Glas erwartet! Nun ja da es ja auch gut nachjustiert sein konnte nahmen wir es mit und das 9x63 sowie das Zeiss Glas ebenso.Wir testeten es zunÃ¤chst an einem Vogelschwarm und mussten leider sehen dass es komplett verstellt und nicht scharf zu stellen war. Egal was wir versuchten es war nicht zu gebrauchen.Das Zeiss und das 9x63 lieÃ uns den Abend ertragen. Der eine oder andere Kaffee und die mitgebrachten WÃ¼rstchen sowie die nette Unterhaltung retteten die Stimmung noch ein wenig. Gegen 23 Uhr bezog sich der Himmel dann endgÃ¼ltig und wir fuhren wieder gen Heimat.Scheinbar versucht die Logistikabteilung von Amazon die unbrauchbaren Artikel so lange an den Mann respektive die Frau zu bringen bis ein Unkundiger sagt naja so schlecht sind die Dinger ja auch wieder nicht. Und fÃ¼r den Preis ...Das halten wir fÃ¼r sehr unschÃ¶n von Amazon (zumal wir per Mail extra auf die Zusendung eines Neuexemplars gedrungen haben) und werden das unbrauchbare Zweitexemplar wieder zurÃ¼ck senden.Wir haben schon mit Celestron Deutschland (Baader) vereinbart dass das neue aber dejustierte Exemplar der ersten Zusendung einzusenden ist und dort instandgesetzt werden soll.Eine erneute Bestellung bei Amazon scheint uns doch zu riskant zu sein. Dort gibt es ja auch kein richtiges Fachpersonal fÃ¼r die Instandsetzung der optischen GerÃ¤tschaften und sie schicken es ein. Das kÃ¶nnen wir auch selbst.Die Kosten werden hoffentlich von Amazon Ã¼bernommen bzw. erstattet.(Nachtrag: Die Versandkosten zum Baader-Service bekamen wir sofort von Amazon erstattet! Vorbildlich wie wir finden.)Als Fazit des zweiten Teils der Rezension mÃ¶chten wir nun schreiben dass man es sich gerade bei den schon geschriebenen negativen Rezensionen Ã¼berlegen sollte ob man (wie wir) auf das GlÃ¼ck hofft ein gutes Exemplar zu erhalten oder doch besser die optischen GerÃ¤tschaften beim Fachhandel kauft.Sehr schade dass wir uns dazu entschieden haben aber scheinbar ist es nicht anders mÃ¶glich SICHER QualitÃ¤t zu bekommen.Und wir sind eher nicht die KÃ¤ufer die auf gut GlÃ¼ck kaufen! Dazu wird das Geld einfach zu schwer verdient als dass man es unnÃ¼tz ausgeben sollte.Auch wenn es keine VermÃ¶gen sind um die es hier geht.------------------------------------Teil eins:Nach dem ich die vielen Rezensionen durchgearbeitet hatte beschloss ich fÃ¼r den Urlaub als Zweitglas ein Celestron 15x70 zu bestellen. Ãber Amazon Prime kam es auch heute an. Super Versand durch Amazon wie immer! Ein Grund warum ich hier einkaufe!Ich muss dazu sagen dass ich gleich mit der Bestellung eine Mail an Amazon gesendet hatte in der ich um die Zusendung eines NEUEN Glases bat. Das wurde mir auch durch die sehr nette Mitarbeiterin von Amazon zugesichert und dem war dann auch so.Also gleich einmal ausgepackt und in Augenschein genommen.Griffig und im Gebrauch wie ein normales Fernglas von heute. Nichts AuÃergewÃ¶hnliches und andererseits auch keine Billigvariante die nach Weichmachern riecht.Gut Verpackt und nagelneu dem Anschein nach.Also meine VergleichsglÃ¤ser 7x50 9x63 10x50 und meinen Refraktor 102x1000 samt der guten alten Vixen GP-DX und ein paar Okulare (25mm bis 40mm) eingepackt und auf`s Feld. Weit raus vor die Tore der hellen Stadt.Keine signifikante Lichtverschmutzung und klarer Himmel ohne Wolken. Temperatur ca. 24Â°C.Also zuerst das Teleskop aufgebaut justiert und ein paar Augenblicke in der Milchstrasse "umhergehoppt". Dann ein Blick durch das CarlZeiss Dekarem 10x50 (Mittelantrieb). Herrlich diese Ansicht! Und nun wollte ich meine Neuerwerbung genieÃen.Auf den Stuhl das Stativ (Berlebach) bestÃ¼ckt und los geht es hin zur Wega. Upps vertan dachte ich denn ich hatte dort einen Doppelstern im Blick. Der hat dort doch eigentlich nichts zu suchen?!Ein kurzer Blick am Glas vorbei und neu angepeilt. Nein es war die Wega. Als ich wieder durch das Glas sah und mir die Leier etwas hereinholte hatte ich alles doppelt im Blick. Ca. 1/3 nach "links oben" verschobenIch dachte ich bekomme einen Anfall. Ein NEUES Glas so dermaÃen dejustiert grenzt schon an eine bodenlose Frechheit des Herstellers!Selbst das kleine Kaufhaus Fernglas 10x25 aus dem Auto hatte nicht ansatzweise eine UnschÃ¤rfe geschweige denn einen "Doppelstern" Wega!!!Wie soll man da die Perseiden vernÃ¼nftig beobachten !?!Mit etwas Galgenhumor kÃ¶nnte man sich auf die doppelte Anzahl freuen  ~:o(Da war fÃ¼r mich natÃ¼rlich der Abend zu Ende und ich packte zusammen.DAS hÃ¤tte ich niemals erwartet. Selbst als ich zu Hause mein Billigglas 7x50 von Bilora (Bilogon Sport) herausholte und es kurz mit auf den Parkplatz nahm hatte es dem 15x70 gegenÃ¼ber eine exakte Darstellung!Ich werde gleich morgen ein exakt justiertes Glas einfordern.Ich kann es nicht verstehen dass es im Produktionsprozess solche Schlampereien gibt. Dass muÃ doch ein AnfÃ¤nger sehen dass es so dermaÃen dejustiert ist.Diese GlÃ¤ser werden meinem Eindruck nach nicht in Chinas Industrie sondern irgendwo in den HinterhÃ¶fen produziert.Ich hatte schon zwei Celestron Reflektoren aber NIE auch nur Ansatzweise Kritikpunkte daran! Nicht bei der Spiegeloptik und nicht bei den Okularen.Ich habe Celestron bereits angeschrieben und werde Amazon ebenso informieren.Sobald es erledigt ist folgt Teil zwei der Rezension.
5,great product at a great price!
5,Upgraded from an old pair of 16 x 50 mm binoculars. In comparison these 15 x 70mms are far superior I'm amazed at how much larger the field of view is. The magnification may not be greater than my old binoculars but because the objective diameter is much bigger (70 rather than 50) a lot more light is collected and the images are so much clearer. Not as heavy as I was expecting and once focused they can be pretty much held steady by each hand being placed at the very end of the housing.
5,Ich gucke gerne in den Sternenhimmel und ich muss sagen dieses 15x70 von Celestron ist fÃ¼r den Preis echt der Hammer. Ich habe auch ein paar Teleskope von klein bis groÃ aber dieses Teil ist echt eine Bereicherung. Eindeutige Kaufempfehlung meinerseits
1,Llegaron daÃ±ados y tuve muchos problemas para devolverlos pues los llevÃ© personalmente a DHL y la ficha de envÃ­o que Amazon proporciona estaba mal hecha.Como consejo mejor esperar a que DHL recolecte el paquete en su domicilio.Me parece que los binoculares tienen una excelente relaciÃ³n calidad-precio; definitivamente no hay otros similares en el mercado aunque nunca pude usarlos apropiadamente.Por Ãºltimo necesitarÃ¡s un trÃ­pode para sacarles provecho.
4,I bought these to supplement my 8" newtonian which is pretty difficult to lug about and you can't just pop out and do a bit of stargazing with it which you can with binos. Reading other reviews I kept my fingers crossed that I would get a pair which didn't need collimating although I did find a couple of Youtube videos that show you how to do it should the need arise - it seems pretty simple. Luckily mine were fine. For the money you pay there will be compromises and there is a bit of flare with bright objects but overall these are pretty good for the price. Don't expect to handhold them for any length of time so you will need a steady tripod or you might get away with a monopod if you're seated and can brace yourself. Now for the bad news given that you will need a tripod or monopod the mount to attach the binoculars to either is shockingly bad. Although it is chunky and has flanges in all the right places to prevent flexing forward/backward and side to side it TWISTS given the slightest excuse and the image darts to and fro like a demented ferret ! It takes a good few seconds to settle after each tiny knock/focus readjustment/object tracking so you spend a good deal of your overall observing time waiting for the binos to stop wobbling. I was fortunate enough to purchase mine on a Prime day and saved enough to buy the Celestron 82030 Heavy Duty RSR Binocular Tripod Adapter at Â£24. There are other cheaper adapters but I can't vouch for them. There must be an awful lot of the original plastic mounts in landfill or recycled as something else. Celestron would be doing  the world a favour if they simply supplied the bins without a binocular mount or better still supplied the hevay duty mount instead. So overall good value for money even factoring in the essential extra cost of a usable mount but remember these are budget binos and won't perform as well as those costing many times more.
5,Den Fernglas ist einfach Klasse und entspricht meine Erwartungen. Top.
4,I have been on the lookout for a pair of bins with relatively high magnification since buying a telescope a few years ago. I use these bins for both terrestrial and astronomical viewing and overall find them very very good - Why you may ask did I buy these if I already have a telescope - The main reason is that the telescope can be a drag to get out and set up - taking about 15 mins to get the settings correct - these bins give me adequate magnification for most astronomical views - from lunar viewing and planetary spotting - Jupiter can be seen along with four of its moons - and when used with a tripod Saturn and its general shape with the rings can be just made out - you wont see any of the planets crystal clear like in pictures in books if you expect to see this you will be disappointed - Jupiter for example is a non discernible blob with four other very faint blobs beside it - but if your into astronomy you wont mind this.Terrestrial viewing however is another thing entirely - excellent clear views over seas mountains and bird watching you will be amazed with how much clarity the images appear - this is due to the 70mm lenses and their light gathering ability - excellent.The weight issue mentioned in a few other reviews is not a major issue in my case but when my partner uses them after a couple of minutes she has to put them down - so the inclusion of a tripod adapter is a necessary one - but I would recommend purchasing a metal one for about Â£10 as in any slight breeze the bins sway a little and that defeats the object of using them on a tripod.In conclusion as I use these bins for mainly astronomical viewing in retrospect I should have purchased the more expensive 25x70mm ones as there is only about Â£20 different in the price - but I was put off these after reading the reviews of them being too heavy - so my advice would be if your the average 40 something male (which I am) and are looking for primarily astronomical binoculars then I'd suggest the more expensive ones but if weight bearing on your arms is an issue then these are the ones for you - honestly a very very good quality product at a reasonable price - if your in the market for a new pair of binoculars - go buy these you won't be disappointed.
4,I bought my 15x70's a couple of years ago as a back-up to my Telescopes for star-gazing! Sometimes the weather doesn't give much time to set-up a scope whereas the binoculars are ready to use at any time: only problem is the weight! After a few minutes the arm strain becomes unpleasant!Using a tripod and adapter does over-come this problem but defeats my original reason for buying them in the first place! However I have found that lying in a deckchair or leaning back against a wall with elbows resting on chest I can support the binoculars for much longer periods without discomfort.While not ideal for viewing planets; Jupiter can be resolved with the 4 Gallilean moons Saturn can be seen with its rings but little detail the moon provides endless fascination but can leave you with "Snow-blindness" near to full-moon.Where these binoculars excell is in finding star clusters the Pleiades look quite stunning!Nebulae and some of the larger galaxies are visible as smudges some structure can be seen in some and a hint of colour in others.Where my binoculars have come into their own is on holiday: I frequently sleep outside in hot climates and can view many of the sights that are hidden from northern latitudes. They are great for day time use also; whether spying out distant ruins whale or dolphin spotting or even just watching those huge cruise liners in the distance. (Note: take as hand luggage on a plane to prevent moisture forming inside!)When unpacking the binoculars for the first time you will find a strange lump of plastic described as a tripod mount: DISCARD THIS IMMEDIATELY: it's worse than useless! Camera tripods are generally too flimsy to take the weight of the 15x70's but with a good metal Adapter  Visionary Heavy Duty Black Metal Binocular Tripod Adaptor - Standard 1/4" Tripod Fitting On Underside - Fits Most 'Traditional' Style Binoculars - Ideal For Very Large Bulky Binoculars        Â and a good quality tripodÂ   ~ HALF PRICE ~ Tripod Universal Folding Good Quality Stand for Digital Camera Binoculars Telescope Spotting Scope SLR Camcorder Astronomy Stargazing & Photography Collapsable with Carry Bag 166cm Tall or 65" Inch High Pan Head Quick Release Fits all mak...        Â they become quite manageable.The lenses are coated for night time use which allows excellent light transission to the eyepieces meaning that they work very well in low light conditions: the lack of lens-front reflection means that highly reflective surfaces (e.g. the sea) can dazzle. It might sound daft but the eye-cups allow the user to view through sunglasses during the brighter parts of the day!Excellent introdution to astronomy at a reasonable price yet versatile enough to be used else-where. Lens quality is good and construction solid: I've now had 2 years of use in all conditions from -30c to +45C sea level to 3000 metres and it's never let me down; definitely money well spent!If you are looking to use this for astronomy I would suggest you add a PlanisphereÂ   Philip's Planisphere (Latitude 51.5 North): for Use in Britain and Ireland Northern Europe Northern USA and Canada         a red LED torchÂ   OVL Dual Beam Astronomers Torch        Â and a good reference bookÂ   Astronomy Manual: The Practical Guide to the Night Sky        Â orÂ   Binocular Astronomy (Patrick Moore's Practical Astronomy Series)
5,For the last 6 months my eyes have been tremendously sore squinting furiously into the darkness through my bedroom window to determine whether or not my neighbour Deidre is doing her ironing in a skin coloured jumper or is in fact topless. Now I have my trusty Celestron 71009 Skymaster 15x70 peeping goggles I can happily confirm she is not merely wearing a skin coloured jumper. Tripod is recommended with the product to enable free hands during usage.
4,DespuÃ©s de haber comprado otro prismÃ¡tico de otra marca (era un 10x50) que no me terminaba de convencer por verse unos reflejos en los objetos luminosos en las dos unidades que pedÃ­ los devolvÃ­ y despuÃ©s de darle muchas vueltas decidÃ­ ampliar a un 15x70 y me lancÃ© a por este. Las opiniones de descolimaciÃ³n y demÃ¡s me echaban para atrÃ¡s pero era cuestiÃ³n de intentarlo. En todo caso serÃ­a el tercer prismÃ¡tico que devolviese je. Pero he tenido suerte.VenÃ­a super bien empaquetado. Me sorprendiÃ³ mucho porque los que devolvÃ­ llegaron en su caja dentro de la de Amazon y poco mÃ¡s de seguridad. Pero este venÃ­a la caja de Amazon; dentro de esta otra caja de Celestron; dentro de esta la caja de los prismÃ¡ticos en papel burbuja; dentro de esta los prismÃ¡ticos dentro de su funda tambiÃ©n envueltos... vamos super seguro todo. Han venido colimados afortunadamente y no se ven "reflejos fantasma" como con los que devolvÃ­.  Eso sÃ­ la aberraciÃ³n cromÃ¡tica se nota un poquito pero dado que no son unos super prismÃ¡ticos de gama alta prefiero esa pequeÃ±a aberraciÃ³n a una descolimaciÃ³n o reflejos donde no tiene que haberlos.Pesan un poco pero en un trÃ­pode van perfectos porque lÃ³gicamente no son para mantenerlos a pulso (tengo un Super Zenith 20x50 de la Ã©poca de los dinosaurios y el peso es muy similar solo un poco mÃ¡s). La cinta para engancharlos sÃ­ es un poco ridÃ­cula tras ver el peso que tienen pero como yo los tengo siempre en el trÃ­pode no me importa tanto. Y por un pero mÃ¡s la gamuza de mis gafas es mÃ¡s consistente que la que trae pero eso ya son nimiedades.Por ahora muy contenta sobre todo despuÃ©s de la desilusiÃ³n de los primeros prismÃ¡ticos pero ahora poder ver la luna tan inmensa y con tanto detalle JÃºpiter y sus cuatro lunas (es impresionante saber que estÃ¡ tan lejos y que puedes verlo tan bien) Saturno (aunque no los anillos claro) Antares Altair... Ahora se ven tantas estrellas y constelaciones que no sabes a cuÃ¡l mirar jaja. Deseando salir a espacio mÃ¡s abierto y aprovecharlos bien.
4,Excellent binoculars but I couldn't get used to the weight. Returned which was easy enough.Using monocular instead. Suits my purpose. Wildlife viewing.
5,I will caveat my five stars to say that I think these bins deserve that rating in the Â£50-Â£250.00 price bracket.When I choose bins I rarely go for anything where the focus doesn't divide into the object lens size by at least five times (just my estimate). These are 15 x 70 so just under that BUT the exit pupil is large so you get lots of light through. They are never going to be as bright as my 7x42 bushnell of course but nor will my bushnell get the distant these give! All the same at 15 x 70 the image is still nice and clear. I can't really see why you would go for 20x or more because of the loss of light unless you get an object lens of 100 or more which would be really big!Anyway I bought mine mostly for watching the killer whales and harbour porpoise that swim along the coast near my house and maybe to see what more distant neighbours are up to sorry I mean stars and stuff. Trying them today they have been perfect. I have actually NOT tried these for astronomy as yet but I'm sure I will.Weight wise they are heavy and they are big in length the main body is pretty much in keeping with a 10x50 pair of traditional bins. Though using them mostly for watching sea life and birds means that I scan the ocean with my eyes and then use these to focus in on detail. If I was to keep them at eye level all the time it would be a real test of strength! So I've no doubt I will look at a tripod.So Tripod? Yes if you are going to use these for extensive periods of time and something good not your standard Â£9.99 aldi type. The adapter that comes with it as already been said by others is pointless. Get another one they are pretty cheap anyway. I really wish they would just drop that in the package and improve the case or use the saving on some other area of the bins.Technically I guess I'm lucky I have had NO collimation issues from the box they were perfectly aligned. Overland viewing gives no fringe not sure with astronomy stuff as that is not really my field.Focusing is a little stiff at the moment though I'm used to that with new bins so I expect they will loosen up.The carrying case is pretty basic no the carrying case is very basic and will offer no protection from bumps whatsoever. I guess when you make a decent pair of bins you have to cut costs elsewhere; celestron have done the cost cutting with a naff neck strap near to useless carry case and a very useless tripod adapter. BUT don't let that put you off. The binoculars themselves are excellent.So in short large but bright and a great price for a decent set of binoculars. Very pleased with the purchase.
4,Pros: 70mm absorbs enough light you can see moon jupitar and it's 4 moons(but don't expect wonders). Pleidas star cluster Himalayan peaks (depends on where you are) and moreCons: chromatic aberration is visible especially in nightsky objects heavy will need a tripod for prolonged usage.Overall if you are a beginner you will enjoy it just find a place with clear sky and less light pollution (nightsky). But don't think about capturing photos with it. You won't get expected results. If you really want to take pictures than invest in a telescope or DSLR.This should be used to experience things with your own eyes.
5,I had been using a nice 12x40 Binos for general viewing and nigh sky viewing - sometimes it took a little while to find Andromeda.Waited 4 nights for a clear sky since these arrived and last night was the night -Not too heavy but you do feel it after prolonged useVery clear and crystal clarityGood rubber eye pads and can be folded down twice for different IPD settingsFound Andromeda within Seconds with these and the vision and size was almost double that of 12x40Managed to see quite a few rocket boosters and sattelites just scanning the sky that could not be seen with naked eye.The binary star in big dipper is really clear.I think there is a tiny collimation issue - which can easily be fixed by turning tiny screws under the rubber grip.Will be setting up on my tripod over weekend for some nice stable views and will connected to small camera and automatic tripod movement and take some fab picturesFor the price and who makes them - very very good purchase - I am very happy
3,I had noticed a lot of comments regards collimation before I purchased  and didnât really expect to have any issues with a hopeful factory ready to view settingâ¦ I was so wrongâ¦ after 3 days of trying to align  Iâve simply buggered these beyond beliefâ¦ far from easy to do as a novice  no instructions for doing this  YouTube videos make it seem simpleâ¦ itâs notâ¦other than thatâ¦ buy a tripod  as they become heavy to hold after a few minutesâ¦ ended up with screwdriver marks torn rubber guard  a cracked prism and a very silly waste of money to myselfâ¦ didnât expect this saga at all !!!
5,Received them yesterday clear night sky first sighting of M31 Andromeda Galaxy - Great!Really pleased with these binos they provide long eye relief (I read somewhere 18mm) which surprised me given that they have powerful 15x magnification. I guess it's helped by the large 70mm objective lens.The image is very good no doubt down to the BAK-4 porro prisms and multi-coated lens.  They focus well and keep focus (left and right) when moving from distant to near objects (and back again).I am pleasantly surprised how easy they are too handle despite their size they can be kept as steady as a pair of 10 x 50s that I tested (but returned due to poor eye relief).  I suspect that this is mainly because one tends to hold them by the narrow part of the barrels as opposed to the main body (prism chamber).  Adopting this method means that the weight of those long barrels is better distributed and less likely to wobble.  However one must be very careful not to bump those long barrels else the optics might be significantly effected.A plastic mount is supplied to attach to a tripod but I bought a more substantial Opticron L mount to use with a monopod or tripod when I want to some support.  A more relaxed and comfortable viewing position which causes less neck strain is to lay on a reclining garden chair.The binos are excellent for the night sky far better than the 10 x 50 Olympus binos that I tried out.  I would highly recommend their use especially as they enable you to quickly navigate the night sky in a way that is not viable using a cumbersome telescope.  Having said that I will occasionally haul out my telescope to look at some objects in more detail. I think these binos offer the best value for money and ease of use say compared to the 20 x 80mm binos by Celestron; those are twice the cost look rather cumbersome and probably difficult to keep steady (although more sturdy due to its central strengthening bar).The package would benefit from a few inexpensive improvements: 1. More substantial neck strap 2. More substantial case 3. Better lens caps on the large objective lens.  The lens caps seem to be soft [silicone?] rubber which can press upon the objective lens and they exude a horrible oily substance that is truely aweful to remove from the lens.  The single 'cyclops' lens hood that fits over the eye piece fits if the eye cups are folded down (for spectacle wearers) otherwise it is too loose a fit.To get the best use of the binos for the night sky purchase the Planishere by Philip's also available on Amazon.
4,I ordered these binoculars just the other week. However when they arrived there was an issue of double-vision. I quickly realised it was a collimation issue i.e. they needed recollimating. Instead of tinkering with the binoculars myself which might have caused permanent damage I decided to contact the seller; they promised to send out a new pair pre-tested for correct vision and subsequently issued me with a return slip to a free post address which means I didn't have to pay any postage return costs.The new binoculars arrived in perfect working order. They're heavy (and I'm someone who does weight-training at least three days a week) but the vision they give - at least during the daytime - is excellent. Quite fabulous for observing birds wildlife etc - and I'm not even a birdwatcher (although I might turn into one now!). In fact I took them with me up a hill in the Pennines earlier in the week and I could see for miles at the top.However I originally got these for observing the night sky which was a bit risky as most astronomy buffs don't recommend anything above 10 x 50 for handheld devices. However having previously owned a pair of very good 10 x 50 binoculars these are a tad better. I've been pleasantly surprised with the results. They're more than decent for tracking stars (on a clear night you'll see more than 10 x the number of stars you'd normally see with the naked eye alone) and the moon is very crisp and clear (I've just spent the last two nights observing this month's full harvest moon).Overall a good product with equally decent vision and build quality. A tripod might be a good accessory especially for nature lovers on a day out in the countryside. For star-watchers I would use these as an ancillary to a more powerful telescope (which is exactly what I plan on doing next).
4,With this pair of binoculars you should get some great views of the moon and should be able to see plenty of stars though when I tried them I couldn't see many for the full moon and clouds it's been cloudy every night since!  For the price you get a remarkably sharp image focusing is easy and attaching the mount is a doddle (the front cap of the central pivot unscrews) but that flimsy plastic mount is the only let-down really; it needs to be made of sturdy metal to be of any use otherwise it just gets the wobbles.  The mount can be re-enforced by glueing metal rods into the grooves on either side; I can't help thinking that if these grooves were full of plastic then the wobble wouldn't be nearly so bad if there at all so filling them with some kind of resin is also an option.The construction seems very solid rubber armour all over with plenty of grippy surfaces to get hold of.  The fabric bag they come with isn't up to much would have preferred a hard case but I suppose it would be serviceable for carrying them and protecting them from some light rain.  Probably better off attaching a proper wide camera strap than the thin one that comes with these.I repeat what others have said - these are too heavy to hold up by hand without some sort of support either rest your elbows on something or (preferably) use a tripod or pole.One word of caution for anyone buying binoculars for the first time - get some expert advice in a camera shop that has a good selection of binoculars or try a friend's pair.  Make sure that you have the eyes for binoculars as some people (myself included) simply cannot look through them without seeing two images due to irregular eye sight; I wear glasses and although they are weak it is enough to make binocular viewing impossible for me.I will be returning my pair for this reason only using the excellent Amazon returns facility and purchasing a monocular instead.
5,I don't intend to get technical with optical performance figures. All I will say is that for the price I paid  these are an excellent pair of binoculars. My main concern was how heavy would they be as once you go beyond the common 10x50 range weight can come into the equation and unless you pump iron a tripod stand or similar is often needed!  Pleasantly surprised this binocular is not heavy and in fact does not weigh much more than a 10x50 pair I have. The field of view is good and I have used the binoculars for astronomy/aviation and general views across the countryside all of which impressed me. I was surprised at the difference a magnification of 15x gives in comparison to 10x.  If you want the very best in optics it will cost you several hundreds of pounds but if you want something that is very good for all round purpose I cannot recommend enough.
4,UtilisÃ©e principalement en observation du ciel profond et lunaire et peu en journÃ©e.Bon rapport qualitÃ© prix permet de belles observations avec grossissement et champ bien adaptÃ©.Support de fixation moyen.
5,These binos are substantial in fact larger than I imagined they would be. They're also fairly heavy so only suited for short viewing sessions but still quite manageable. Any bigger would be too big IMHO. Leaning against a wall helps a lot as does supporting the weight of the binos. The binoculars come with a tripod mount adapter which looks a little flimsy and might produce some vibration but would still be better than freeholding.The quality of the glass and optics seem good. There's a green tint to the glass showing some sort of anti-reflective coating has been applied. I'm not an expert in binoculars but I'm guessing Sky at Night are more so and they gave the optical qualities of the lenses a very positive review. So it's good to know that where it really matters (optical quality) hasn't been budgeted too much.The binos are covered in rubber and the grip is good they're selling for Â£60 right now which is a lot of glass and optics for the money. Especially when you consider you can easily pay this for a single eye piece!Last night I got first light with my new Celestron Skymaster 15x70 Binoculars I've never used binos for astronomy before so I can only compare my view to my scope. However I can describe how a few common sky objects appeared last night from my light polluted home location.Jupiter - The four Galilean moons were easily resolved as four dotted points around Jupiter. The planet itself appeared as a small very bright white ball. No colour or surface detail was viewable. Around the edges of Jupiter I could see red/green. I was surprised by just how bright Jupiter appeared blowing out any hint of colour.Andromeda - Easily located and looked like a little smudge which to be fair is exactly how it looks through my scope from my location.Orions Neb - The binos resolved a lot of stars around the Nebula area but there was no 'nebulosity' apparent. This is mostly due to being in a light polluted location.Stars/Clusters - Where you see one star with the naked eye you see 20 through the binos. They remain sharp and without noticeable CA. Stars also keep their colour well red stars stay red blue stars blue etc (unlike my finder scope where every star looks the same..) Star clusters looked great filling the view with stars.Very Good 61 quids worth especially as they can double up to make excellent long range terrestrial viewing as well.Dave.
5,Arrived from Amazon well-packaged.  Upon testing these bino's with my own Swift Newport 10 x 50's  I had to say that the image quality (sharpness) was pretty much the same. I had in the past checked my Swift  with previously owned (stolen by a burglar) Leitz Trinovad  10 X 25's  and they were quite amazingly about the same sharpness........so that's where these Celestron bino's are at.  I really don't find them heavy as other reviews state.....in fact upon weighing them with my Swift  bino's the weight is just about the same.  In fact that was the first impression I got that they aren't heavy at all.  They are well made feel good in the hands diopter setting is good balancing the lens out as required by the user.  I would say that 15 x 70 is about where you should be--Celestron do a 25 X 70 but you can bet the brightness drops.  Out of the box I expected to find some flaw or other--I usually do---But no I just can't knock something that is as right as feasibility will allow.  I paid Â£62 for mine which basically was a gift.....they really are worth double!  So to sum up:  Good clear lens good brightness well-made a well-balanced feel and quite light considering the large size.  I would finally say due to this size that a good heavy tripod with a screw-top  (not a quick release plate) is an absolute.
5,El Ãºnico inconveniente es que venÃ­an descolimados es decir visiÃ³n doble pero tal como ya me habÃ­an hablado mis compaÃ±eros de la AgrupaciÃ³n AstronÃ³mica colimarlos es muy fÃ¡cil por la buena accesibilidad a sus tornillos de ajuste lo arreglÃ© en 5 minutos. Todo lo demÃ¡s es excelente para astronomÃ­a es ideal su peso por el tamaÃ±o es insuperable la calidad Ã³ptica no se puede pedir mÃ¡s por el precio mÃ¡s que suficiente las estrellas se ven muy puntuales con un buen enfoque estoy deseando que pase la Luna para apuntar a la VÃ­a LÃ¡ctea pero ya puedo notar que me va a alegrar mucho la vista. LlegÃ³ sin retraso el pedido. Para uso a luz de dÃ­a van perfectos tambiÃ©n aunque no es necesario tanta entrada de luz. Estoy muy satisfecho con la compra es un aparato esteticamente agradable y su tacto tambiÃ©n al parecer estÃ¡n fabricados de manera que no es necesario acercar los ojos mucho a los oculares y las gomas evitan esa proximidad esto hace que las lentes de los oculares no se manchen con los parpados como me pasaba con los anteriores y permanecen limpios durante mÃ¡s tiempo. Viene con adaptador para tripode no me arece muy practico para apuntar al cielo porque sufre mucho el cuello pero es un plus que no viene nada mal tenerlo son de plastico y hacen que vibre un poco pero no tiene demasiada importancia tambiÃ©n incluye bolsa de transporte tapas para las lentes y correa para colgar al cuello. Lo pedÃ­ con el seguro de accidentes por lo que pueda pasar muy buen precio tambiÃ©n el seguro. Es un producto que recomiendo sobre todo para uso de rastreo del cielo nocturno aunque ya tengas un telescopio como es mi caso me parece un complemento casi imprescindible.
4,Ich habe dieses Fernglas von einem Amazon-Partner fÃ¼r unglaubliche 70 gekauft. Die Ware war als gebrauch-praktisch neu ausgezeichnet: Also ein RÃ¼cksendung. Ich rechnete damit dass das Glas dejustiert war dies ist ein hÃ¤ufiges Problem (insbesondere aus den Bewertungen aus amazon.com erkennbar). Das Glas hat Justageschrauben deshalb habe ich es bestellt. RÃ¼cksenden wÃ¤re auch mÃ¶glich gewesen.Es war genau wie ich erwartete: Die Verpackung war beschÃ¤digt also ein RÃ¼cklÃ¤ufer. Das Glas schielte extrem.Justieren ist einfach. Es gibt dabei zwei Fehlstellungen: 1) Die Bilder sind ungleich hoch 2) Das Glas schielt nach innen oder nach auÃen. 1) ist sehr stÃ¶ren 2) gleicht das Auge meist aus. Ich beschreibe hier wie man 1) wegjustiert.Unter der Gummiabdeckung des PrismengehÃ¤uses ist auf jeder Seite eine Justierschraube: Oben zum Okular zu ziemlich in der Mitte. Einfach den Gummi mit einem Uhrmacherschraubenzieher anheben er ist dort nicht geklebt. Dann setzt man das Glas auf ein Stativ (wobei der mitgelieferte Adapter nahezu unbrauchbar ist) stellt ein mÃ¶glichst weit entfernte Ziel ein (Mast Turmspitze) und stellt beide Okulare scharf. Dann blickt man aus einer kurzen Entfernung so etwa 15 cm in die Okulare und stellt ein Detail in einem der Seiten in die Mitte. Durch diesen Blick wird das Auge davon abgehalten sich an die schiefen Bilder anzupassen. Man sieht sehr genau ob eines der Bilder hÃ¶her ist als das andere. Das bringt man jetzt mit den Justageschrauben in Deckung. Das war`s meist.Auf der Innenseite zum Mitteltrieb hin befinden sich weitere Schrauben die das Schielen ausgleichen. Das ist aber nicht so wichtig.Jetzt zur QualitÃ¤t (des justierten Glases): Ich mÃ¶chte das Instrument fÃ¼r Astronomie benutzen dafÃ¼r ist es auch gedacht. Ein leichtes 15x70 ist das grÃ¶Ãte Glas an dessen freihÃ¤ndige Benutzung man noch denken kann. Ruhige Bilder bekommt man bei dieser VergrÃ¶Ãerung nur durch Anwendung aller Tricks Kopf anlehnen Arme oder Ellbogen abstÃ¼tzen usw. Aber man bekommt halbwegs ruhige Bilder ohne Stativ hin jedenfalls ich. Das Celesstron-Instrument ist unglaublich leicht mein 20x80 wiegt fast das Doppelte. Wenn man es vorn anfasst und alle MÃ¶glichkeiten ausnutzt kann man es freihÃ¤ndig wirklich benutzen. Das Instrument hat Weitwinkelokulare und zeigt nach Datenblatt 44Â° Feld. Exakt habe ich es nicht gemessen aber so ungefÃ¤hr stimmt es. Damit kann man sehr viel Himmel gleichzeitig im Blick haben das Aufsuchen wird zum Kinderspiel.Die BildschÃ¤rfe in der Mitte des Gesichtsfeldes ist ausreichend. NatÃ¼rlich ist ein 10- oder 20-mal teureres Glas ein wenig schÃ¤rfer aber groÃe Aberrationen konnte ich nicht feststellen. BlausÃ¤ume an kontrastreichen Kanten sind gerade eben erkennbar und stÃ¶ren kaum. Die StreulichtunterdrÃ¼ckung ist vernÃ¼nftig (aber nicht exquisit da muss man in andere Preisregionen gehen).Auch fÃ¼r den nicht reduzierten ein wirklich praxisgerechtes GerÃ¤t was man Ã¼berall mit hinnehmen kann. MarkenglÃ¤ser dieser Ãffnung sind so teuer dass man stÃ¤ndig Angst vor BeschÃ¤digung oder Diebstahl haben mÃ¼sste. Die EinschrÃ¤nkungen die man dafÃ¼r hinnehmen muss sind erstaunlich gering.Ich gebe dennoch nur vier Punkte weila) man die GlÃ¤ser werkseitig justieren kÃ¶nnteb) der Stativadapter unbrauchbar ist. Zum GlÃ¼ck hat der Anschluss ein Standardgewinde so dass man andere Fabrikate einsetzen kann. Der meines 20x80 passte z.B.Nachtrag nach einiger Zeit Benutzung: Ich habe die HohlrÃ¤ume des Stativadapters mit Zweikomponentenkleber (Epoxidharz) ausgegossen. Die Steifigkeit hat sich dadurch erheblich erhÃ¶ht und er ist gut verwendbar. Ich rate zu dieser Modifikation.
4,A Little bit heavy but must buy it will amazing you really
5,Der Versand war wie gewohnt reibungslos und schnell.Ich habe mir das Fernglas bestellt um eine Alternative zu meinem Teleskop zu finden. Nach langem Lesen und Suchen im Internet habe ic mich fÃ¼r dieses Fernglas entschieden. Es gibt bei allen FernglÃ¤sern in dieser Preisklasse immer positive und negative Punkte.Als ich das Paket erhielt pakte ich ein wirklich groÃes Fernglas aus und konnte es kaum erwarten zum ersten mal den Nachthimmel damit zu erkunden. Ich hatte mir gleich eine Handyhalterung dazu gekauft um das gesehene auch gleich fotografisch fest zu halten.Zur QualitÃ¤t des Fernglases:Ich bin absoluter Laie in Sachen Optik.Das GerÃ¤t ist Bauartbedingt recht schwer aber liegt gut in der Hand. Die Augenmuscheln sind angenehm weich und lassen sich hervorragend umklappen. Das Fokussierrad lÃ¤sst sich relativ schwer drehen was Vorteile mit sich bringt. Das erst mal am Tage durchsehen lÃ¤sst einen schon erahnen das man ein Fernglas gekauft hat was wesentlich mehr freude am Himmel bringt als ein "Hosentaschenfernglas".Frei Hand muss man eine extrem ruhige Hand beweisen was mir persÃ¶nlich nicht auf Dauer gelingt.Die Stativhalterung gehÃ¶rt fÃ¼r mich auf ein hochwertiges Stativ bzw. sollte man eine Parallelogrammmontierung nutzen.Die Handyhalterung ist Ã¤uÃerst stabil und einfach zu bedienen.Man sollte beachten das man beim Fotografieren ein gutes bis sehr gutes Stativ benutzt weil das Fernglas mit dem Stativhalter enorm schwingt.First light:Zum ersten Mal in den Nachthimmel geschaut habe ich ein paar Tage nach Erhalt des Fernglases.Erstes Objekt war der Mond. Man kann viele Details sehr gut erkennen aber er ist schon ziemlich hell im Auge.Zweites Objekt waren die Plejaden. Da kann das Fernglas mit dem recht groÃen Gesichtsfeld seine StÃ¤rke zeigen. Es lohnt sich sich etwas Zeit zu nehmen und einfach mal das Objekt wirken zu lassen. Ein wirklich schÃ¶ner Anblick durch dieses Fernglas.Nachdem ich dann zwei verschiedene Objekte aufgesucht hatte wollte ich einfach mal den Nachthimmel abscannen und mal gucken was so geht.Und es geht so Einiges.Offene Sternhaufen sind eine wahre Freude mit diesem Fernglas.Also ich als Laie wÃ¼rde dieses Fernglas einem interessierten AnfÃ¤ngerastronom empfehlen und falls es dann doch nicht mit dem Hobby klappt ist es nicht so viel Geld was man falsch angelegt hat.
4,Best product but very heavy.....
4,Without tripod please donât use it.. it needs strong hold and support. Definitely not for beginners. Worth the money you spend if you donât want to buy telescope.
5,Amazon Warehouse purchase saved me Â£30 which is not a bad thing to start with. A rather scruffy box but contents look perfect.These Binoculars are very powerful and really do need a Tripod or at the least a monopod even your heartbeat will make the image shake.Once you have them held firmly they are absolutely brilliant especially at night they certainly give the night sky a whole new dimension.The Moon is a real treat to view with these and are well suited for Star gazing.If this is to be your first purchase to start looking at the night sky whatever you do do not waste your money buying any cheaper brands I promise you will regret it and they could potentially put you off looking at Astronomy as a hobby all together.All in all an excellent pair of Binoculars from Celestron who have been around for many years and come highly recommended by astronomical societies all over the country.
5,Das Fazit vorweg Interessierte kÃ¶nnen dann ja weiterlesen:Das 15x70 ist eher der Allrounder das 20x80 ist mehr fÃ¼r Astrologie geeignet und zeigt wesentlich mehr Details auf dem Mond.Sowohl das 15x70 wie auch das 20x80 von Skymaster sind solide GerÃ¤te. Das 15x70 kann man noch fÃ¼r mobile TÃ¤tigkeiten wie Segeln oder fÃ¼r Naturbeobachtung benutzen bei dem 20x80 empfehle ich schwerstens den Griff zum Stativ. Allerdings war bei meinem alten Stativ der Halt des 20x80 eher suboptimal. Kann aber auch am Stativ liegen!Jetzt der lange Text:Ich hatte mir das 15x70 und das 20x80 von Skymaster gekauft um erst einmal zu "Testen" ob mich das Thema Astrologie weiter Interessieren wÃ¼rde.In vielen Internetforen wurde von den sogenannten "Einsteigerset Teleskopen" abgeraten also entschied ich mich fÃ¼r die Fernglas Variante.Erster Eindruck:Beide GerÃ¤te machten einen soliden guten ersten Eindruck auf mich. Sie erfÃ¼llen vollkommen das was man fÃ¼r den Preis erwarten kann. Gutes Arbeitsmaterial aber halt nicht die Luxusklasse. FÃ¼r die darf man aber auch Faktor 10 Drauflegen :)Die Nutzung:Das 15x70 kann man mit ruhigen HÃ¤nden noch ohne Stativ fÃ¼r die nÃ¤here Umgebung benutzen. Es empfiehlt sich also auch fÃ¼r andere Einsatzbereiche als Astrologie. Ich hatte es zum Segeln mit und konnte dort Prima Bojen etc. mit ausmachen. FÃ¼r Sternenbeobachtung sollte man sich trotzdem ein Stativ zulegen.Das 20x80 ist schon ein schwereres GerÃ¤t. Aufgrund der VergrÃ¶Ãerung und des Gewichts kann ich nur wÃ¤rmstens ein gescheites Stativ empfehlen!Auf meinem alten Stativ aus den 80ern ist die Anbindung des 15x70 Sehr gut die des 20x80 ist etwas wackeliger aber nicht schlecht.Die Interessante Frage fÃ¼r die meisten ist ja: Was sehe ich Ã¼berhaupt dadurch?Durch das 15x70 konnte ich gut den Mond sehen die Krater zeichnen sich schon ab und lassen mehr erahnen.Durch das 20x80 sieht der Mond noch viel besser aus! Man erkennt auch feinere Krater Strukturen. Ich bilde mir ein 3 Jupiter Monde in StecknadelkopfgrÃ¶Ãe gesehen zu haben. Die Planeten wie Mars Jupiter und Saturn lassen sich schon gut ausmachen und erkennen.
5,DIe positiven Rezensionen brachten mich dazu das Glas zu kaufen obwohl ich fÃ¼rchtete dass man bei dem Preis und dem Objektivdurchmesser schlechte QualitÃ¤t erhalten wÃ¼rde. Denn groÃe Objektivdurchmesser sind nunmal teuer zu fertigen.POSITIV:+Die Leistung ist gut sie entspricht dem was ich als einfacher Naturfreund brauche. Das heisst: ich bin kein passionierter Vogelbeobachter oder Ã¤hnliches troptzdem schau ich mir gerne mal einen Vogel an jedoch ohne maximale BildqualitÃ¤t zu benÃ¶tigen.+DÃ¤mmerungssehen ist klasse! Darum wollte ich ein groÃes Objektiv. Mit einem billigen Glas bin ich bereits auf die Nase gefallen (unter 30 Euro) dieses Glas jetzt ist hingegen nicht billig sondern preiswert.+Gummiert (ich lehne das Glas ohne zu zÃ¶gern an Mauerkanten und Ã¤hnlichem an gefÃ¤llt mir sehr gut).+Winkeladapter liegt bei sodass man das Fernglas auf einem Fotostativ befestigen kann (klar der Adapter ist von schlechter QualitÃ¤t: das Glas schwingt hin und her wenn man es nicht sehr vorsichtig handhabt. Aber man hat immerhin grundsÃ¤tzlich die MÃ¶glichkeit ohne ExtrazubehÃ¶r kaufen zu mÃ¼ssen. Bei hÃ¶heren AnsprÃ¼chen muss man einen besseren Adapter kaufen).NEGATIV:-Der Blick zum Himmel ist halbwegs okay. Mehr aber nicht. Wer wirklich Himmelsbeobachtungen machen will ist meines Erachtens mit diesem Glas nicht gut beraten. Es ist mir nicht gelungen einen Stern scharf zu stellen. Auch nicht bei Nutzung nur eines Okulars sprich: ein Auge geschlossen.-ZubehÃ¶rqualitÃ¤t ist schlecht. Klar viel erwarten darf man nicht bei dem Preis denn bei dem Preis wÃ¤re es gerechtfertigt wenn KEIN ZubehÃ¶r dabei wÃ¤re. Aber man sollte halt nicht zuviel erwarten. Mir ist eine KunsstoffÃ¶se der Tragetasche gebrochen. Habe den Gurt jetzt selber auf andere Art befestigt. Wenn man durchs GelÃ¤nde robben will ist die Tragetasche jedenfalls nix- es sei denn man geht mit Nadel und Faden ran und verbessert ein wenig.-Der UmhÃ¤ngegurt ist viel zu schmal fÃ¼r das Gewicht des Glases es ist also auf Dauer unbequem. Ich habe das Band eines alten Glases daran befestigt jetzt passt's.FÃ¼r Leute die keine speziellen hohen AnsprÃ¼che haben ist es ein tolles Glas!
5,Las primera unidad llegÃ³ descolimada y se ha devuelto gracias a Amazon. La segunda parece que todo esta correcto. Se ha vuelto a montar como se puede ver en un trÃ­pode Hama Star 61 con el adaptador de MÃ³vil Pro de Slokey(que es perfecto) y con su telÃ©fono preparado.  Se echa de menos un trÃ­pode mÃ¡s estable pero por el precio no se puede pedir mÃ¡s. De hecho los Celestron SkyMaster Giant 15x70 no son tan pesados. Lo puede soportar perfectamente. Incluso a pulso. AdemÃ¡s se agradece que lleve un soporte incluido con mejor base. Y serÃ­a mejor todavÃ­a si fuese de metal.  El ajuste de las Ã³pticas van muy finas y se ajusta perfectamente. La visiÃ³n es perfecta como debe ser. Por fin se ve como debe el cielo nocturno y no hay imÃ¡genes dobles. Ahora sÃ­ que cumple. Lo Ãºnico que falla es el trapito que lleva para limpiar las lentes. No sirve para nada. Una buena gamuza de optica y asunto resuelto.
4,The product is good and value for money. But the neck strap is not worth and total waste. It cannot hold the binoculars at all.
5,Very nice easy to use with good view
5,Halloich mÃ¶chte hier kurz den Celestron Skymaster 15x70 bewerten.Viel habe ich fÃ¼r den Preis von etwas Ã¼ber 80 Euro inkl.Versand nicht erwartet wurde jedoch vom Gegenteil Ã¼berzeugt.Gleich nach Ankunft des Paketes ging es ans auspacken. Das Fernglas kam ordentlich und doppelt verpackt bei mir an.Der Lieferumfang beinhaltet das Fernglas eine Schutztasche ein Reinigungstuch einen Stativadapter und eine Bedienungsanleitung. Die Bedienungsanleitung das Putztuch und den Stativadapter kann man vergessen und gehÃ¶ren in die Tonne. Das Fernglas ist jedoch sehr gut verarbeitet wenn man den geringen Preis nicht vergisst. Die Gummiarmierung macht einen guten und griffigen Eindruck. Ein wenig riecht das Gummi jedoch. Die Fokussierung und die Dioptrieneinstellung laufen satt und feinfÃ¼hlig. Die VergÃ¼tungen auf den optischen FlÃ¤chen sehen sehr ordentlich aus (BlauvergÃ¼tung).Am Tage richtete ich das Fernglas zu Testzwecken auf einen waldbedeckten HÃ¼gel und auf die Dachpfannen unseres Nachbarn um einen ersten Eindruck von der optischen Leistung zu bekommen. Es gab nichts zu meckern. Farben wurden sehr gut und naturgetreu wiedergegeben. Das Bild hell klar und sehr scharf.Am Abend (bis spÃ¤t in die Nacht hinein) richtete ich das Fernglas an den Sternenhimmel um die Justage der Optik zu kontrollieren. Das GerÃ¤t war super kolliminiert und bedarf keiner weiteren Nachjustierung. Schwein gehabt!!!??? Sterne werden sehr gut abgebildet bis auf die letzten ca.10% des Gesichtfeldes wo die Sterne etwas unschÃ¤rfer und ungenauer abgebildet werden.An diesem klaren Abend sah ich eine ganze Reihe von DeepSky-Objekten in den Sternbildern SchÃ¼tze Skorpion und Leier. Angefangen bei M4 der direkt und eindeutig als nebeliger Ball zu sehen war Ã¼ber M22 (groÃ sehr hell rund mit deutlichem Lichtanstieg zum Zentrum hin) NGC6642 (sehr schwach aber sichtbar) M28 M18 M21 M17 (mit Andeutung der Nebelform) M24 (Sterne ohne Ende!!!) M16 (Sternhaufen mit deutlichem Nebelhintergrund) M57 (hebt sich deutlich als kleines Scheibchen von den vielen Sternen in der Umgebung ab).An diesem Abend war auch der Planet Saturn auf der Beobachtungsliste. Hier erkennt man deutlich den Ring und auch die Planetenscheibe jedoch nicht wirklich getrennt voneinander.Das Fernglas ist sein Geld mehr als wert.Viele GrÃ¼Ãe und klare NÃ¤chteTorsten
5,Das GerÃ¤t war optisch perfekt justiert und ich bin mit dem Preis/LeistungsverhÃ¤ltnis sehr sehr zufrieden.Verpackung:GlÃ¼ck gehabt trotz sehr mangelhafter Verpackung: der Umkarton war praktisch genauso gross wie die OVP und diese nur durch ein StÃ¼ck Papier gegen das Verrutschen gesichert. Das kann gut gehen muss aber nicht. SchlieÃlich handelt es sich um ein optisches Instrument!Stativadapter:Kurze Version:  FÃ¼r Dreibeinstativ gleich einen aus Metall (hier fÃ¼r ca.  10 â¬ diverse erhÃ¤ltlich) kaufen.Lange Version: Der Stativadapter ist horizontal nicht sehr verwindungssteiff um es mal vorsichtig auszudrÃ¼cken und wackelt wie eine Gurke. Der Kuststoff ist sehrweich. Wen dass nicht stÃ¶rt: OK. FÃ¼r die reine Freihandbeobachtung z. B. mit einem Schulterstativ ist das in Ordnung.Leider ist aber die Einstellschraube ist schon beim ersten Anschrauben abgebrochen. Gut: ein 6er-GabelschlÃ¼ssel fÃ¼r ein paar Cent tuts auch ... ich habe die Schraube mit UHU-Plus wieder zusammengefÃ¼gen kÃ¶nnen.  Ich habe zusÃ¤tzlich noch je eine Metallschraube seitlich in den Adapter eingelegt und mit verklebt. Nun ist der Adapter leidlich verwindungsstabil.Ich verwende ihn mit einem kombiniertes Tisch/Schulterstativ "Cross Cruiser" von Cullmann. Dieses Stativ kann man auch auf eine Ebene stellen (oder den Boden wie z. B. ein Feld einen Stein oder Ã¤hnliches).ABER: wenn mann ein Stativ verwendet ist der mitgelieferte Stativadapter absolut UNBRAUCHBAR. Er ist einfach nicht verwindungssteiff genug( Hier sieht man das ganz gut: [...] ) um das Objekt gezielt einzustellen.Fazit:Sehr gutes GerÃ¤t sowohl fÃ¼r z. B. die Tierbeobachtung (VÃ¶gel insbesondere Vogelgruppen) als auch die Astronomie. Bei der Tierbeobachtung sollte man aber bedenken dass die Naheinstellgrenze 13 Meter (!) betrÃ¤gt. Da kommen auch wirklich entfernte Ziele in Frage. Einen Vogel Ã¼ber sich im Baum wird man nicht scharfstellen kÃ¶nnen selbst wenn der Baum sehr hoch ist!Bildfehler am Bildrand sind in dieser Preisklasse vÃ¶llig normal - selbst bei teureren Optiken!  Wichtiger fÃ¼r mich ist z. B. die Ausleuchtung und der wirklich beeindruckende Seheindruck durch die groÃe Austrittspupille. Auch die Gegenlichteigenschaften und der Kontrast im Bild waren fÃ¼r mich visuell vÃ¶llig in Ordnung. FÃ¼r BrillentrÃ¤ger lassen sich auch die Muscheln gut umklappen und die Dioptrienkorrektur ist ausreichend (schÃ¤tze mal etwa +/- 3).
5,Wasn`t sure what to expect since they were such an apparently low price. Obviously have some weight to them which surely can`t be a bad thing. They have plenty of adjustment for differing eye distances in people even get to fit nicely for my young grandson to use them suppose there is a special term for that but no idea what. I was amazed at the brilliant 3d effect that can be seen when viewing landscapes so I can assume that the collimation is perfect on these I have. Images are good and clear and very sharp indeed matching the brilliant Olympus DPS-1 8 x 40 ones sold on here. I didn`t expect much when viewing the heavens so wasn`t disappointed when looking at Venus and Jupiter all I could see was a bit bigger bright ball of light. I did though get a friendly wave from the co-pilot in a police helicopter overhead whom I could see very clearly probably looking for some scrote who stole a bicycle from someone. I was peeping on some large flower tubs about 200 yards away and was gobsmacked that I could count the stamens on a dying tulip and the amazing 3d effect I was viewing across the various plants.Without these binoculars I could barely make the flower out at that distance. I would sure recommend these but do not expect too much looking up at the heavens if that is your thing get a decent telescope. I hate using one so I`m stuck with binoculars I guess.
4,Good product
3,The product is heavy for beginners and stedy pro 550 tripod is unable to take its weight I bought tripod separately. The name skymaster is a misnomer we can see the birds etc but night sky not any clear than naked eye. Only moon seems brighter. I bought this by reading reviews that one can see andromeda galaxy also but NO. None of that is possible. Buy for bird watching it's heavy though and shakes and you can't focus moving objects faster. So you miss the moving animals from being watched. Only sitting birds 15magnified.
5,Bought on Amazons OCT. 20 prime  lightning offer. I had toy"d  with this idea for several months before buying as I  have a 4" refractor  T/ scope and an old but excellent pair of Vesper 10x50 x 7.5 wide view Binos.Having read good and not so good comments about various  large binos.  I am extremely pleased with my choice they are truly excellent for price paid and with a newly aquired Edsi ball mount 2mt +tripod a steady view no more neck ache strain.These Binos present a good daytime view of landscape /seascape almost rival that of my 4" refractor T/scope however due to  high cloud conditions have not used for Mars/Saturn/Jupiter/Venus etc viewing but impatient to try ! even tho will not match t/scope with multiple lenses. For ease of set up and quick scanning pleasantly work for me so far.
4,Its a great pair of binoculars. Little heavy so try getting a tripod. You can see the craters on moon !! Its amazing. However planets are only seen as tiny dots. Although u can clearly differentiate between a star and a planet but u wont be able to see details of the planets !! If u r a beginner and ur budget is kinda low go for it. When its clear sky u can see tiny stars which are naked to eye in clusters and that view is to die for. Overall a great product.
5,Ich hatte mir schon immer mal ein "groÃes" Fernglas fÃ¼r gelegentliche Natur- und Schiffsbeobachtungen (hauptsÃ¤chlich im Urlaub) gewÃ¼nscht war aber bisher der Ansicht dass man fÃ¼r ein gutes Glas - ich bin Hobby-Fotograf und habe in diesem Bereich durchaus hohe Anforderungen an die Optiken - mehrere Hundert Euro ausgeben mÃ¼sse. Das war es mir fÃ¼r die seltene Nutzung nicht wert.Im Rahmen der Blitzangebote bin ich auf das Skymaster 15x70 aufmerksam geworden und beschloss es einfach mal auszuprobieren. Die existierenden Rezensionen zeichnen ja eigentlich ein sehr positives Bild; die grÃ¶Ãte Gefahr scheint zu sein ein vÃ¶llig dejustiertes Exemplar zu erhalten aber selbst dann hat man ja - siehe die Rezension von Uwe Pilz - noch MÃ¶glichkeiten die schlimmsten Fehler selbst zu korrigieren.Meine Erwartungshaltung war also nicht sehr hoch. Was kann man bei einem Preis von nicht einmal 70 Euro fÃ¼r ein solches Fernglas dessen Konkurrenten schnell ein Vielfaches kosten schon erwarten? Im schlimmsten Fall eine Ã¼beraus mÃ¤Ãige Verarbeitung unscharfe und kontrastarme Optik obendrein vielleicht noch schlechte Justage ...Ich wurde jedoch eines Besseren belehrt: Schon nach dem Auspacken war ich positiv Ã¼berrascht. Gute Verarbeitung (sicher nicht auf Top-Niveau aber fÃ¼r die Preisklasse deutlich mehr als angemessen) vollstÃ¤ndiges ZubehÃ¶r (Linsen- und Okularabdeckungen Trageriemen Tasche Stativ-Adapter). Auch die Optik Ã¼berzeugt: Scharfe und kontrastreiche Darstellung. Optische Fehler sind mir nicht aufgefallen also habe ich wohl auch ein gut justiertes Exemplar erwischt.Den Stativ-Adapter habe ich noch nicht ausprobiert aber der Rest des Glases erfÃ¼llt meine persÃ¶nlichen AnsprÃ¼che voll so dass ich restlos zufrieden bin. Angesichts des gÃ¼nstigen Preises verwundert das eigentlich denn mehr kann man fÃ¼r das Geld wirklich nicht erwarten. UnabhÃ¤ngig vom Preis betrachtet wÃ¼rde ich dem Skymaster vielleicht drei bis vier Sterne geben aber angesichts des exzellenten Preis-/LeistungsverhÃ¤ltnisses hat sich das Glas fÃ¼nf Sterne redlich verdient.
5,La verdad es que tenÃ­a serias dudas sobre si comprarlo o no debido a algunos comentarios. Finalmente me decidÃ­ y la verdad es que ha sido un acierto total. Estoy empezando en el mundo de la astronomÃ­a y me recomendaron antes unos binoculares que un telescopio. AsÃ­ fue como los comprÃ© y en tan solo una semana estoy completamente fascinado con ellos. He visto jupiter junto a sus cuatro lunas mÃ¡s importantes que se ven como un gran punto de luz y cuatro puntitos mÃ¡s pequeÃ±os y tenues alineados. TambiÃ©n vi saturno donde se intuÃ­a bastante bien los aros y la luna se ve ESPECTACULAR.No espereis que sea como un telescopio ves los puntos pero en el caso de los planetas no ves las lÃ­neas ni las diferentes pigmentaciones. Pero es una verdadera pasada.Los prismÃ¡ticos 15x70 se ven genial muy buena calidad de imagen y poco peso en comparaciÃ³n con el tamaÃ±o. Una muy buena elecciÃ³n!!!!La imagen tiembla un poco pero si se agarra por el extremo de las lentes se disminuye el movimiento un montÃ³n. Lo Ãºnico que en mi caja no venÃ­a el adaptador para el trÃ­pode pero en todo caso se lo recoamare ahora al vendedor. En cuanto a que estÃ©n descolimados que era lo que muchos decÃ­an al principio me rallÃ© pq me lo pareciÃ³ pero tras ajustarlos y colocarlos de forma que viera una sola imagen quedÃ³ todo perfecto.Muy buena compra!
4,A very good product for biginners and if u are in place where light pollution is less . U can spot and see so many night objects..
4,Yes you can see stars which you can't see with you naked eyes.  It's a good binoculars for long distance subjects even on land.You should have a good tripod with a load capacity 3kgs and above.  At its 1.5kgs And bulky don't expect to take it for long treks.  If you don't have a tripod you can have recklining chair to have a proper sky view for star gazing. Yes you will enjoy the view of Moon.In ground Objects I can see Colours on the edge of the objects on bright light situation.
4,Como llegaba la hora de jubilar mis antiguos 10x60 y no me apetecÃ­a gastar mucho dinero me decidÃ­ por Ã©ste modelo en cuestiÃ³n.La verdad es que en Ã³ptica lo barato suele salir caro motivo por el cual me temÃ­a que me iba comprar una "patata" pero bueno decidÃ­ arriesgarme influenciado en parte por opiniones que habÃ­a leido sobre el artÃ­culo en cuestiÃ³n a pesar de que no les voy dar uso astronÃ³mico sino terrestre.Debo decir tras llevar unos dÃ­as con ellos que me he quedado gratamente sorprendido. El agarre resulta muy agradable pues estÃ¡n recubiertos en goma y a pesar del peso y tamaÃ±o a mÃ­ personalmente me resultan bastante cÃ³modos de usar a pulso.Obviamente no tienen la nitidez de unos prismÃ¡ticos de gama alta pero para quien no sea muy exigente con Ã©ste punto son mÃ¡s que suficientes. De hecho desde la terraza de mi piso consigo leer una seÃ±al indicadora de un pueblo a unos 500-600 metros de distancia o distinguir el para rayos de una iglesia a mÃ¡s de 1 km. (y no estoy exagerando)En resumen no me arrepiento nada de haberlos comprado pues debo decir que he manejado prismÃ¡ticos mÃ¡s caros que Ã©ste y cuya calidad de imagen era bastante inferior (de hecho mis antiguos 10x60 me habÃ­an costado casi 150 euros y no conseguÃ­a distinguir las letras de dicha seÃ±al)Dudo que en relaciÃ³n calidad precio haya muchos artilugios de Ã©ste tipo que puedan superarlo.Asimismo el envÃ­o una vez mÃ¡s muy puntual.
5,El pedido llegÃ³ antes de lo previsto. Con las ganas que tenÃ­a de probarlo esto sube una estrella.Mi nivel astronÃ³mico es alto pero solo querÃ­a disfrutar del cielo sin mÃ¡s complicaciones. Esta opiniÃ³n es para eso.Los prismÃ¡ticos:Son elegantes viene con una funda para guardarlo. Los protectores no son nada del otro mundo pero cumplen su funciÃ³n.De primeras no pesa pero si te vas a poner a mirar las estrellas o planetas ponte cÃ³modo que en breve el brazo se te cansa.Para ver cosas de la tierra generales no te va a hacer alta un trÃ­pode pero al intentar ver cosas del cielo tipo JÃºpiter se movÃ­a demasiado ( y yo tengo buen pulso).Sobre el uso:Tiene un poco de aberraciÃ³n cromÃ¡tica (esto es que las luces de las estrellas o planetas tienden a ser como rojas o verdes en los bordes). Si solo quieres disfrutar no te molesta.La luna se ve increÃ­ble.Los planetas cuesta un poco mÃ¡s por el tema del trÃ­pode y que se ve bastante pequeÃ±os. JÃºpiter es el que mejor se ve (incluso algunos de sus satÃ©lites) pero sin llegar a definirse su manchas. (Al menos desde mi posiciÃ³n).Se puede ver cÃºmulos de estrellas y me llama la atenciÃ³n que mires donde mires (al entrarle tanta luz) vas a ver una estrella que no veÃ­as a simple vista. Incluso vas a ver satÃ©lites artificiales desplazÃ¡ndose todo el rato.Si deseas ver con mucha mÃ¡s precisiÃ³n planetas etc..compra el 20x80 y un trÃ­pode.Mi idea era tener unos prismaticos para entretenerme viendo el cielo asÃ­ que para lo que cuesta estÃ¡n bastante bien.
4,El Sky master 15x70 es mejor que el 25x70 porque se ve con mejor nitidez que el de 25x70 y porque la salida de pupila es mas grande que la de 25x70. Esta Ãºltima tiene 17 si mal no recuerdo mientras que la de 15 tiene 44. en cuanto a los 10 aumentos mas que tiene el de 25 no se nota en absoluto lo eh probado a los dos hasta hice videos y les puedo asegurar que no hay diferencia alguna por tanto me parece una exageracion que estÃ©n cobrando unos 20 0 30 pavos mas por el de 25x70 que es peor que el de 15x70. Ahora no lo vuelvan a subir de precio; porque resulta que yo al principio comprÃ© los de 15 pero al ver que habÃ­an de 25 dije wooouuu si tiene 10 aumentos mas se tiene que ver mas lejos una mierda con perdon de la expresiÃ³n entonces a la hora de devolver los de 25 vuelvo a comprar los de 15 que en un principio me costaron 81 pavos con monedas pero ahora resulta que lo subieron a 103 pavos con monedas. AsÃ­ que solo por esa subida no les doy mis cinco estrellas solo 4. Y patatin patatero este cuento se ha acabero. Si me olvido de aÃ±adir algo mas luego reedito el cuento.
5,Fantastic binoculars despite being on the heavy side I got used to their weight to be honest and don't find them too heavy but for long use once on a tripod they are really wonderful. I've used them as much in the day as the night looking at the stars and moon I need to learn more about what I'm actually looking at but I've used them to watch ships out at sea in the daytime and bird watching. The attachment that comes with them to set them on a tripod is rather lightweight and you may want to pick a stronger more secure attachment. I'm really pleased with them and got them at a bargain too! They are large so be prepared if you haven't had a pair of these before I didn't really expect them to be so large and I laughed my head off when I took them out of the box. But they are great and I take them everywhere with me!
5,I'm not an expert in the field but what I can say is the binoculars themselves seem to work fine with good clarity and seem well made.  The lens caps and eyepice cap seem cheap and not a wonderful fit but serve the purpose.  Again the carry bag and binocular strap are of poor thin quality that  it seems a shame to use on such a good pair of binoculars.  They came with an adapter for a tripod which is made of plastic.  In conclusion for the price you probably won't get a better pair of binoculars however the accessories make it apparent how they can sell at this low point.  It is clearly where the savings were made although happy they are passed down too.
4,Ich hatte vorher ein Bresser 10x50 Fernglas doch davon war ich sehr enttÃ¤uscht. Nun wollte ich nicht noch einmal am falschen Ende sparen und dachte mir dass es nicht verkehrt sein kann etwas mehr zu investieren. So habe ich tagelang recherchiert und gesucht bis ich schlieÃlich auf dieses Celestron Fernglas gestoÃen bin. Die vielen positiven Rezensionen haben mich letztendlich dazu bewogen es mal damit zu probieren. Und was soll ich sagen? Das Celestron SkyMaster 15x70 ist da genau das wonach ich gesucht habe. QualitÃ¤t Leistung und Preis stimmen einfach. Das Fernglas an sich ist allerdings schon ein ordentlicher Brummer im Vergleich zu meinem alten Bresser. Dennoch liegt es gut in der Hand und ist nicht allzu schwer. Ein Stativ (ein Stativadapter ist Ã¼brigens mit dabei!) sollte man aber doch irgendwann dazu nehmen denn auf Dauer werden die Arme nÃ¤mlich etwas schwer. Die Sicht ist hervorragend klar und deutlich. Man kann damit wirklich sehr gut und sehr weit sehen. Meine regelmÃ¤Ãigen Mondbeobachtungen machen mir dabei am meisten SpaÃ. Vogelbeobachtungen sind aber auch sehr fein. Meine nÃ¤chste Anschaffung ist ein Adapter mit dem ich mein Smartphone an das Fernglas montieren kann. Darauf freue ich mich auch schon sehr. Ich bin mit diesem Fernglas sehr zufrieden und kann es ohne EinschrÃ¤nkungen weiter empfehlen. Einziger Kritikpunkt wenn man das Ã¼berhaupt so nennen kann ist die mitgelieferte Tasche und die Trageschlaufe. Hier ist die QualitÃ¤t etwas mau aus meiner Sicht. Aber vielleicht bin ich da schon zu verwÃ¶hnt ;-)
5,Arrived quick with no damage to packaging and collimation was good. Sharpness to visual viewing is very good aspecialy for the price and the eye relief on the 15x70 is also very good I've not had any eye strain using these binoculars. These are fine for beginners and do a good job for terrestrial viewing at distance  which is why I got them as I have hills and open fields near me cellestrial viewing is pretty good too' though I would recommend a good sturdy tripod for this. They can feel a little heavy after a while and field of view will wobble and become frustrating. Overall though they are a good buy and i would recommend the celestron 15x70s.
5,This is a brilliant pair of binoculars and I would highly recommend to anyone to purchase. I used this binoculars for the whole month of April 2015 to watch the International Space Station (ISS) passing over overhead nearly every night and got a great view of it. There is a mount that comes with it for use with a camera stand and I made use of this also and got brilliant close ups of the moon and other planets like Venus Mars and Saturn or Jupiter I think. While using the mount on the camera stand I also spotted objects flying overhead that were not planes I am assuming they were satellites or maybe spy planes? But that was exciting as well.The one negative I have is that if you are going to use these binoculars as a telescope like I have been using by mounting it on a camera stand then it's quiet hard to get the focusing correct as when you try and look through the view finder the slightest touch of it will cause the binoculars to shake and you have to step back and let it settle down before trying again. However it's a pair of binoculars and not a telescope so if you are going to use it as one then you just have to live with this.Overall I am delighted with these binoculars and I will be using it for a long long time!
4,Considering the price quality is excellent and afforded a detailed view of the moon at night and aircraft during the day. They work very well considering my myopia and astigmatism. A bit bulky for extended use but I expected this; they are now used on a sturdy mount fabri-cobbled  from a cheap bicycle work stand. The only criticism I have regarding their use for astronomy is the lack of a clear night sky since the purchase!
5,If you are starting your astronomy journey itâs good to start with the 15x70 binoculars (than a cheap under 15k telescope). Binocs are easier to use more portable than a telescope and offers a range of objects to observe in the night sky.On a clear night (bortle class 8-9/ i.e most metro cities) youâll be able to see1. A lotta stars (PS: try lying on a carpet and observing the night sky using your binocs.)2. Constellations3. Planets (and trace itâs movements)4. International Space Station and some other satellites5. Comets6. Nebulas & clustersWith a pair of binocs get a good stargazing app - Night Sky/Stellarium (even Celestron has one) and get started on your cosmic journey!
5,I bought the Skymaster 15x70 after days of watching/reading reviews. I was worried if the collimation would be right out of the box and thankfully it was. These binoculars have given me one surprise after another every day for the past couple of weeks ...I wish I had gone in for this earlier and not remained a naked eye/virtual stargazer so far. There isnât any vignetting and the resolution is great. Even for someone who lives in the city and is severely limited by light pollution I already feel that the binoculars have paid for themselves. I canât wait to get away from all the haze and head somewhere to soak in the experience of scanning clearer skies.
4,Voulant m'initier Ã  l'astronomie je me suis dirigÃ© assez naturellement vers cette paire au rapport Q/P plus quâintÃ©ressant. Pour une premiÃ¨re paire de jumelles c'est plutÃ´t bien fait mais assez imposant. Le poids est correct mais prÃ©voir trÃ©pied car Ã  x15 cela bouge bcp.L'image est bonne mais dÃ¨s qu'on compare avec la concurrence un peu plus cher on voit la diffÃ©rence: manque de contraste de luminositÃ© et de piquÃ©. A ce prix il ne faut pas demander de miracles. Mais elles font le job et en astro les 70mm (enfin plutot les 65mm) sont apprÃ©ciables.Bon rapport Q/P pour qui veut s'initier avec une paire abordable et de qualitÃ© correcte. Ah et avec les Åilletons ils ne sont pas simples Ã  replier
4,Lo comprÃ© con la intenciÃ³n de usarlo como complemento a la observaciÃ³n astronÃ³mica. En algunas ocasiones el uso de prismÃ¡ticos es mas adecuado que la utilizaciÃ³n de un telescopio debido a la amplitud de campo del primero.Este producto dispone de una luminosidad aceptable su construcciÃ³n es solida y en mi caso no he tenido que sufrir de aberraciones significativas. El mayor prblema que he tenido es con el accesorio para la sujeccion al tripode es muy endeble transmitiendo toda clase de temblores al prismÃ¡tico lo que hace muy incomoda la observaciÃ³n...y no no es el tripode ya que en mi caso utilizo un modelo manfrotto con unas caracteristicas muy por encima de las que serian precisas para aguantar el peso del prismÃ¡tico.RecomendarÃ­a buscar otra sujeccion tripode-prismatico al menos en lo tocante a la observaciÃ³n astronÃ³mica.Respecto a la visiÃ³n diurna no presenta este problema ya que no requiere tanta precision puntual Para estos casos se puede incluso usar "a pulso" siempre y cuando dispongamos de un buen apoyo.En general me parece un aparato recomendable atendiendo sobre todo a la relaciÃ³n apertura/precio.
5,Very pleased with my binoculars the moon has never looked so good and can see far more stars than I imagined. Also pleased that it comes with a very sturdy tripod mount that fits nicely in my camera tripod.  i am also getting a phone adapter so my 3 year old can also use them as he loves looking at the stars with me. My only grumble (and Iâm being picky) despite the great British weather is the lense cap that covers the eye piece comes off a little easy. Over all excellent purchase.
5,I am an amateur Astronomer and chose these over a telescope as my first purchase. WOW these are amazing...PROS.-Portable and easy to use without mount if you are reasonably strong better and less shaky with tripod-Viewing is excellent without a mount if a little shaky but that obviously depends on the individual-They come collimated (aligned) as long as they haven't been battered in transit-EXTREMELY easy to use-Here's the important bit WHAT CAN I THROUGH THEM?? During the last three nights I have viewed The Pleiades Hyades Saturn Mars Jupiter The Moon Aldabaran Castor & Pollux Milky Way Betelguese Sirius...... The list goes on.Planets are visible even they only appear as discs and looking at clusters in phenomenal (you won't believe it till you see it)* I am waiting for a contact lense fitting so what I have seen so far is without my eyes even being 100% can't wait to see what awaits.CON-The plastic mount that is supplied with the binoculars is garbage and should be replaced with the OPTICRON L MOUNT and twinned with the TAMA STAR 63 MOUNT- Not 100% sure but I don't think these can be used with glasses sadly :( Update ** You can use glasses with these however I find it easier withoutThese are the place to start in my opinion for the price you can't go wrong
5,Excellent product for stargazing!  Requires a tripod.Cons :Eye Relief is bad.Does tend to get foggyYou can notice Chromatic Aberration but it wont be a big dealMight come with Lens out of alignment and has to be collimated if your package had a rough ridePros :Build Quality is goodFocus is goodHas Dioptric correction I can use them without my glassesComfortable to hold and useComes with Tripod adapterWhat you can see :Really nice for Birding and terrestrial viewing.Moon with very good details.Moon/Moons of Jupiter not Jupiter itself.Saturn will be a small point.Orion Nebulae i was able to get good details for a binocular.Really good views of Pleiades star clusterAndromeda GalaxyTriangulum Galaxy in dark skies.Multiple other brighter deep sky objects.All these objects can be seen in a light polluted city so it was really worth it.Buy yourself a phone adapter and a tripod and you can take images of everything you see!
5,For what they are no complaints. What I mean is they are only 15 magnification. I have barely tested them out but they focus easily enough and the image is clear.They are however nicely made and not heavy for holding for a while when viewing nearer field. Like I was looking at a mast on the horizon and the shake was OK. Astronomical objects are harder to settle on and I will need a tripod. Since astronomical objects are so small and far away the tiniest movement sends the image whizzing about. In other words a tripod is necessary for astronomy and recommended for longer viewing of nearer field like bird watching.The 20x80 are about twice the weight.Mine arrived yesterday and came quicker than I expected. I think what made me post straight away is that they arrived working. Some people say their arrive out of collumation. I would have had to start googling if mine had.I saw these binoculars rated as good many years ago with BBC Sky at Night magazine. I am not dissapointed. I knew fifteen magnification wasn't going to be earth-shattering. Therefor I am happy to use them and their price was ideal. Plus I bought them on the day Amazon offered Â£10 off any purchase over Â£50. I paid Â£56.69 total. I feel attached to them already.
5,First of all this was my first professional binoculars after childhood toy binoculars....First impression was that I felt my money wasted because at that time I didn't have a tripod. After the arrival of tripod everything changed. Bit heavy for carrying around for a casual birdwatch. U have u set down entire setup. If u don't have tripod this is a waste....The tripod suggested with this photon i guess is crappy tripod. Don't buy it. I bought vanguard pan and tilt tripod which can be used for both binoculars and DSLR.Easy user interface. Bag provided looks cheap. Tripod mount is sturdy. Still it wobbles in wind.Stargazing is still not as expected may be due to light pollution in delhi. Even viewing angle is uncomfortable with this. If u r serious in astronomy better go for a telescope.Overall good binoculars for sitting down watching with a tripod.
4,Not have words to describe i felt its perfect
4,Evidentemente no son prismaticos de alta gama pero cumplen perfectamente obtienes imÃ¡genes impactantes. Por el peso y los aumentos necesitas un trÃ­pode bueno para disfrutarlos 100%
3,Good binacular but image is not so much clear.
5,Das Skymaster 15x70 Fernglas von Celestron habe ich mir in erster Linie fÃ¼r nÃ¤chtliche Himmelsbeobachtungen als ErgÃ¤nzung zu meinem Hobby-Astronomie-Equipement gekauft. Nachdem ich mir im Internet viele verschiedene Produkte angesehen und Kundenrezensionen gelesen habe entschied ich mich fÃ¼r das Celestron weil ein vernÃ¼nftiges Preis-LeistungsverhÃ¤ltnis versprochen wurde. In der Tat bin ich bis heute ca. ein Jahr nach dem Kauf und nach fast tÃ¤glichem Gebrauch absolut begeistert von der Leistung dieses GerÃ¤tes. Trotz des doch recht hohen Gewichts und der beeindruckenden GrÃ¶Ãe ist es zu meinem stÃ¤ndigen Begleiter bei SpaziergÃ¤ngen am Tag und bei Himmelsexkursionen in der Nacht geworden. AbbildungsschÃ¤rfe und Kontrast sind beeindruckend minimale kaum wahrnehmbare UnschÃ¤rfe am unmittelbaren Bildrand stÃ¶ren nicht. Als Hobbyastronom ist neben SchÃ¤rfe und Kontrast die LichtstÃ¤rke zur Beobachtung lichtschwacher Objekte am Nachthimmel entscheident. Hier liegen eindeutig die StÃ¤rken des Skymasters!  Eine Vielzahl von Deep-Space-Objekten wie  Nebel Galaxien und Sternhaufen die Ã¼blicherweise nur in Teleskopen sichtbar werden  lassen sich mit dem Skymaster entdecken. Allerdings sollte man hier ein Stativ verwenden um die nÃ¶tige Ruhe in das Glas zu bringen (Adapter im Lieferumfang enthalten). HÃ¤ufig verzichte ich auf den aufwÃ¤ndigen Aufbau meines Teleskopes und gehe nur mit meinem Skymaster auf Entdeckungstour am Himmel.Das Glas ist sauber verarbeitet liegt gut in der Hand macht einen soliden und robusten Eindruck. Ein breiterer Tragegurt wÃ¤re dem Komfort dienlich.Wer nicht die allerhÃ¶chsten professionellen Erwartungen an ein Fernglas stellt ist mit dem Skymaster bestens bedient. Unschlagbares Preis-LeistungsverhÃ¤ltnis! FÃ¼r vergleichbare Leistung und QualitÃ¤t kann man auch sehr viel mehr Geld ausgeben!
5,Lo hemos comprado como paso previo a la adquisiciÃ³n de un telescopio y aunque no es lo mismo estamos muy contentos como iniciaciÃ³n  / nivel principiante. La luna se ve muy bien se pueden apreciar ciertos detalles.
4,I purchased these for astronomical use (Â£30 second-hand via the Amazon platform). They are heavy. Fortunately I am reasonably well-built and after a while you can get a steady image without a tripod. They have a wonderful solid tactile feel which I really like. Optics are pretty good for stargazing. I now use them exclusively for plane spotting (from the back garden; not from airports). In that respect they really are first class. On a bright day you can spot aircraft liveries at 10000 feet. Fab.

4,Hola mi opiniÃ³n sobre los prismÃ¡ticos es muy buena en cuanto calidad precio son luminosos estÃ¡n bien colimados Y la sensaciÃ³n de calidad de materiales es la adecuada al precio.Son muy nÃ­tidos y al atardecer ofrecen buena luminosidad tambien para observaciÃ³n de cielo nocturno(Estrellas) son vÃ¡lidos CÃ³mo un 2Âº dispositivo de fÃ¡cil manejo y rÃ¡pido de usar.Estoy contento con la compra y recomiendo su adquisiciÃ³nAh tiene cromatismo un halo purpura en lineas o contornos muy Contratados algo desdeÃ±able desde mi punto de vista y Normal en esa gama de calidades. Me costaron entre 80 y 90â¬.
4,I bought this bino for stargazing. Terrestrial viewing was very good but celestial viewing was not up to the mark. Distant point source or objects like a bright planet or stars could not converge in to single point but some spikes were observed. I wanted to see venus and jupiter but the image was not clear and spikes was observed around the corners that gives me disappointment but still I was able to see three of jupiter's moon and some satellites also like a small point. Moon was cristal clear. If you want to buy this for low light terrestrial viewing then this could be a perfect binocular for you. During night you can see through this binocular what is completely invisible to unaided eye because of its larger objective lens. Although this is a normal binocular and not having night vision or image stabilization.
4,On the whole these do what they need to do. They come in a useful carrying bag and have a plastic tripod mount which I have not yet tried but it seems sturdy enough although I would be inclined to be as gentle as possible with the whole setup (as with any optical equipment really!)There have been reports and reviews suggesting the âcollimationâ (I use the speech marks for a reason) is off and indeed my pair had the same issue. You can of course alter the conditional alignment screws which will in most cases sort the problem out. It is worth checking the exit pupil for circularity/âcatâs eyesâ.All in all these are excellent beginner astronomerâs binoculars. They will increase your interest and understanding of night skies and propel you into a new world of star gazing and astronomy. Be warned though youâll want a telescope next.
4,Bei dem Skymaster handelt es sich um ein preiswertes Glas im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes.Die SchÃ¤rfe ist gut. Das Bild ist auch gut wenn auch nicht Ã¼berragend.Die Frage die sich mir nach den ersten Tests allerdings aufdrÃ¤ngt ist wofÃ¼r will ich dieses Glas nutzen? Was kann dieses Glas was ein gutes 10x50 nicht kann?Ich habe es mit meinem Nikon Action 10x50 verglichen das ebenfalls sehr preiswert war/ist:Das Skymaster:+ vergrÃ¶Ãert etwas mehr- ist schwerer- ist weniger scharf- die Verwacklung ist deutlich grÃ¶Ãer (Kein Sternegucken ohne Stativ und gutem(!) Adapter - Der beiliegende ist Schrott)- die LichtstÃ¤rke ist etwas schwÃ¤cherFazit das Nikon macht deutlich mehr SpaÃ. Und die bessere SchÃ¤rfe und das knackigere Bild machen die geringere VergrÃ¶Ãerung m.E. mehr als wett.Allerdings liefert das Skymaster noch ein paar Gesellschaftsspiele mit:Mit dem beiliegenden Tuch kann man ausprobieren wer in kÃ¼rzester Zeit die meisten Fusseln auf die Linsen bekommt.Mit dem Stativadapter aus Plastik kann gewettet werden wer das Glas lÃ¤nger zum Schwingen bringt bei einmaligem Antippen.(Mein Rekord: 20sec)Und mit dem 8mm breiten Tragegurt weiÃ man bald wer am meisten Schmerzen aushalten kann.Mein Tipp: Wer unbedingt ein 15x70 sucht soll hier zugreifen. Wer ein gutes Allroundglas sucht dem empfehle ich einen Probeblick durchs Nikon Action 10x50.Frohes Binoculieren!!
4,Good for beginners
4,Ich kann mich dem VorgÃ¤nger anschlieÃen. Das GehÃ¤use ist etwas klobig wirkt auch optisch nicht wie ein solides Fernglas (SpaltmaÃ Verarbeitung) das Gummi drumherum muffelt leicht und nach Gebrauch fÃ¼hlen sich die HÃ¤nde an als ob Gummi daran haftet! Jedenfalls wasch ich meine HÃ¤nde anschlieÃend.Ich denke Wunder kann man fÃ¼r das Geld nicht erwarten.Nun zum Guten:Ich bin kein groÃer Kenner der Branche und werde es versuchen mit den Augen eines Amateurs zu beurteilen...als ich das erste mal durch das Objektiv geschaut habe war ich sehr angenehm Ã¼berrascht; kurz gesagt: es ist knackig scharf und das auch bei wenig Licht bzw. Nachts. Letztens habe ich den Mond betrachtet. Man kann zahlreiche Krater sowie die Mare gut erkennen. Zum Rand hin habe ich den Eindruck dass ich teils Geiterbilder sehe bzw. leicht milchig wird. Aber das ist ok fÃ¼r den Preis!Das Universum aus freier Hand zu beobachten ist nicht einfach. Ich helfe mir so aus dass ich die Arme an einen Tisch lehne...dann gehts ganz gut wobei man auch nicht lange schauen kann finde ich weil das GerÃ¤t schwer ist. NatÃ¼rlich kann man sich auch ein Stativ kaufen.Ich habe die Ware Ã¼ber Amazon bestellt und von Astroshop erhalten. Alles ging reibunglos Ã¼ber die BÃ¼hne und das Fernglas kam sogar 1 Woche frÃ¼her an wie angekÃ¼ndigt!Fazit:Insbesondere fÃ¼r Einsteiger empfehlenswert!
5,Used for wandering in the heavens for which it is perfect. It is a little on the heavy side and you need to work out how you are going to take some of the weight. I am using a tripod but need to look at some other alternatives like using mirrors or a counterweight.The quality of image is as expected. I can see a beautiful view of jupiter and at least four moons. The milky way lights up with stars. The seven sisters was a treat.Very happy with my purchase.
5,Great binoculars moon looks lovely nice weight lovely product highly recommended
5,Los comprÃ© para ver JÃºpiter y Saturno que estaban todas las noches del verano dominando el cielo. Y poco a poco empecÃ© a descubrir todo lo que hay sobre nuestras cabezas. En la terraza de mi casa un pueblo con poca contaminaciÃ³n lumÃ­nica la vÃ­a lÃ¡ctea se ve en las noches sin luna y es impresionante descubrir los detalles del universo. AndrÃ³meda la nebulosa de OriÃ³n PlÃ©yades Saturno no distingues los aÃ±illo aunque se intuye la forma ovalada y JÃºpiter si te permite ver las lunas minÃºsculos puntitos que estÃ¡n ahÃ­...Pesan mucho cuando llevas un rato y tienes que buscar puntos de apoyo o un trÃ­pode.TambiÃ©n he observado aves en una laguna y te puedes quedar horas.  Creo que he realizado una buena compra.
4,Als gelegentlich in die Ferne Guckerhatte ich bislang ein 10x50 Fernglas in gebrauch.In unserem letzten Urlaub war mir das aber zuwenigweil ich Schiffe auf der offenen See doch nur bedingt betrachten konnte. Daher habe ich mich fÃ¼r das 15x70 entschieden. Auch aufgrund der ganz guten Rezensionen hier.TagsÃ¼ber habe ich es schon ein paarmal benutzt und die VergrÃ¶sserung passt mir gut. Es lÃ¤sst sich ja auch noch ganz gut hÃ¤ndeln meist stÃ¼tze ich mich eh mit den Ellenbogen irgendwo ab.Heute war das Wetter mal gut und ich hab das Fernglas mal auf ein Stativ geschraubt und so Just for Fun mal in den Himmel geschaut.Der Hammer was da plÃ¶tzlich zu sehen ist. Habe glatt die Zeit vergessenSterne gucken ist toll und die Sateliten die da so rumfliegenganz schÃ¶n viele.Auch Flugzeuge sehen mit dem Fernglas in der Nacht very Nice aus.Also ob es fÃ¼r ernsthafte Benutzer gut ist mag ich nicht beurteilen.FÃ¼r mich als gelegenheits Nutzer ein tolles Glas zu einem tollen Preis. Habe den Kauf nicht bereut.
4,Good binocular.long use tripod must
5,a good set of binoculars flimsy bag not withstanding. after researching many and fixing on the next one up which was cheaper. reading all the comments changed my mind to this one. less magnification and a wider view which meant less wobble. having a tripod already is a boon
4,Ich nutze das Celestron SkyMaster 15x70 nun seit Ã¼ber einer Woche und bin immer noch begeistert von der fÃ¼r diesen Preis exzellenten Optik. NatÃ¼rlich darf man kein Nikon- Zeiss- oder Optolyth-Level erwarten aber die Ãffnung von 70mm macht einfach viele SchwÃ¤chen des Glases wieder wett.Mein "Hauptglas" ist ein 20 Jahre altes Optolyth Alpin 10x50 welches ich seinerzeit fÃ¼r ca. 700 DM gekauft habe. Das SkyMaster ist nun mein "Schreibtischglas" um schnell mal einen Finken- oder Drosselschwarm durchzumustern oder abends auf der Dachterasse mal einen Blick in die Sterne zu tun. Im Vergleich muss sich das Celestron nicht verstecken. NatÃ¼rlich ist der Trageriemen wie auch der Stativadapter fÃ¼r die Tonne aber irgendwo muÃ ja bei diesem Kampfpreis gespart werden und keiner dieser Nachteile ist ein echter Showstopper. Klar vor hellem Hintergrund zeigt das Glas deutliche FarbrÃ¤nder (chromatische Abberation) aber die sind wirklich zu verschmerzen.Das Gewicht ist ebenfalls durchaus o.k. das Alpin ist nicht wesentlich leichter und wenn man sich aufstÃ¼tzen kann sind durchaus auch lÃ¤ngere Freihand-Beobachtungen mÃ¶glich. Das GerÃ¤t liegt angenehm und bequem in den HÃ¤nden und ist gut austariert.Klasse ist auch die groÃe Ãffnungspupille von 25cm die BildschÃ¤rfe Ã¼ber das gesamte Blickfeld ist ebenfalls o.k.Fazit: FÃ¼r diesen Preis ein Top-Glas!
5,If you know how to hold properly. You don't need a tripod. Hold at the top. Your hands won't get shaky.
3,El producto cumple con las caracterÃ­sticas descritas el problema que hemos encontrado es que el "Adaptador de MÃ³vil Pro para PrismÃ¡ticos Monoculares Telescopios Terrestres Telescopios AstronÃ³micos Microscopios. Compatibles con Cualquier Smartphone." no lo envÃ­an a Canarias y los prismÃ¡ticos sÃ­ los enviaron asÃ­ que ahora los tenemos pero no les podemos adaptar el mÃ³vil y no entendemos porquÃ© ya que sÃ­ lo ofrecen al comprarlo junto con los prismÃ¡ticos y el trÃ­pode.Â  Una explicaciÃ³n por favor o mejor aun envÃ­enlos a Canarias tambiÃ©n. Gracias!
5,I bought the 15x70 version as I was worried about an unsteady (and dimmer ) image with the 25x70 version. These binoculars have excellent image quality for the price. Reading some other reviews I had been worried that the colimitation may be out but no issues for me. In terms of image quality: it is easy to see four of Jupiter's moons and just about possible to see Saturn's rings. Focusing is dead easy and the diopter adjustment is fine. My only minor gripe (and it is minor!) is that the rubber eyepiece cover is difficult to put back on easily.
5,These binoculars are very good when comparing them with the price of the competition. Bear in mind that you will have to spend another Â£10 or so for a better adaptor than the one supplied.  Focussing mechanism a little on the stiff side when new.  Larger than I expected but not as heavy as they look.  Can be hand held for short periods but need to be on a tripod for astronomy (e.g. making out the moons of Jupiter).  It's not so much the weight although that is a factor it's more the magnification.  The high magnification gives you a narrower field of view which accentuates any slight shaking.  With the higher magnification binocularsavailable in this range ( the '25 times 70' which are roughly the same weight ) this effect will be noticeably worse.  This is why some people think a pair of 8 times or 7 times binoculars are best for finding your way round the night sky.  The '15 times 70' are a good compromise at a very reasonable price.
3,I purchased these binoculars to observe the night sky and occasional birds and other sights. The first problem was with collimation which was set incorrectly or the package had received a blow which had affected the setting. However with minor adjustments the correct collimation was established and now eye drain is minimal. I cannot really comment on the quality of the lenses but it seems that for day use the quality is good and the picture is clear but for stargazing the quality could be better as the stars tend to excessively and unevenly "flare" if the focus is not set just right for both oculars. There is a small plastic mounting stand to assist in mounting on a tripod but this is slightly too flimsy for stargazing. The weight is not bad but I wouldn't call these "light" either but the weight helps with stability. The difference in light intensity is very evident between a 50mm and 70mm of Celestron especially in poor light conditions and I'm glad to have a 70mm set despite the bulkier size and more weight. For more serious stargazing I'd recommend 20 or 25 times of magnification though. Also the lens covers could have some kind of attachment lug to keep them safely on as they were pretty loose and tended to fall off easily. I put a strip of black insulation tape around the rim not tightly just so that it is there firmly and now the covers stay on very well. The 15x magnification is comfortable for me and I prefer these over my 8x50 set in everyday use.
5,These are the biggest binoculars you would want without a tripod. The magnification is enough for long distance landscape observing the moon in great detail in looks 3D and learn the stars. I have owned mine for over a year now and I still get excited using them to see at long distance the Chinese optics are of very high quality. The build quality could be better but for the casual observer they are fine. I would recommend putting them on a tripod for astronomy as they will give you arm ache after a while. We have seen Saturns rings just about and I have taken them on holiday to view the landscapes around studland. These are definitely not the hikers choice they are too bulky but if you have room in the car boot they can be a really good asset to observe what is on the horizon. Focusing works fine and they come with a case which is adequate and a cheap tripod holder which you can either throw away or strengthen somehow as it is plastic. Recommended.
5,I can honestly say I was worried about what I was buying simply because I haven't a baldy about this stuff!! But I need not have worried these bins are fantastic u can see loads. My son wanted to see Star constellations and the moon brighter & boy it's clear as anything!!!One thing I'd recommend is a stand as if u shake at all like I do it's harder work to see.But highly recommend this product!! 5stars x
3,If u r preparing to buy  order tripod too â¦ u cant lift it for long time this is too heavy
5,habe aus Italien bestellt ... artikel puenktlich angekommen .. Das Fernglas ist auÃergewÃ¶hnlich Ã¼ber meinen Erwartungen :) ich empfehle sehr!
5,Cuando me llegaron no era capaz de enfocar o configurar de ninguna manera los prismÃ¡ticos para no tener una visiÃ³n doble. A base de leer entendÃ­ que estaban descolimados y no es que no supiese utilizarlos.PedÃ­ el remplazo a Amazon con la suerte de que los de remplazo no tenÃ­an ese defecto. Quitando esa mala experiencia que gracias al excelente servicio de Amazon no fue un problema mayor los prismÃ¡ticos son una pasada me puedo pasar horas mirando constelaciones o la luna tambiÃ©n puedes ver y distinguir objetos en tierra a decenas de kilÃ³metros.Vivo en Madrid y la calidad del cielo es pÃ©sima: contaminaciÃ³n lumÃ­nica y contaminaciÃ³n en general pero aÃºn asÃ­ se distingue en dÃ­as claros cosas como la nebulosa de OriÃ³n. No he conseguido ver planetas mÃ¡s alla de Venus que es visible a simple vista.Otro tema es el peso para disfrutar de su uso hay que utilizar un trÃ­pode pero el soporte de trÃ­pode que se incluye al ser de plÃ¡stico provoca grandes vibraciones por lo que he comprado uno metÃ¡lico para que la experiencia de uso sea lo mÃ¡s satisfactoria posible.En resumen: Estoy contento con la compraComo contra: -Mal control de calidad ya que los primeros me llegaron descolimados. -Soporte/adaptador para trÃ­pode de plÃ¡stico que provoca muchas vibraciones.Si lo compras en Amazon (para poder remplazarlos sin pegas en caso de defecto) los recomiendo sin dudarlo.PD: en las fotos aparece un trÃ­pode que obviamente no estÃ¡ incluido con los prismÃ¡ticos.
5,Amazing binoculars. Idk what anybody expects from binoculars but if you know how powerful binoculars are and you can navigate in the darkness of the sky then these are an amazing pair of binoculars. Of course you have a trade off between weight and quality but it is worth it.The things you can see:-Orion nebulaStars of orion belt that you cannot see with naked eyes like tau orionisJupiter moons(galilean)Saturn ringsMars moons(extremely faint)Detailed moonAnd many more celestial bodies
5,Ein gutes Einsteiger Fernglas........ in Relation zum Preis bleibt dann eigentlich nur ein Sehr Gut.FÃ¼r knapp 85 â¬ kann und darf man kein High End erwarten. Weiterhin muss man wissen fÃ¼r welchen Einsatzzweck das Glas geeignet ist und wofÃ¼r eher nicht und wie man es dann benutzt.FÃ¼r einen Einsteiger zum Sterne gucken bestens geeignet. Auch als Fortgeschrittener als gÃ¼nstiges Zweitglas eine klasse Wahl.Gut verarbeitet die QualitÃ¤t der optischen Darstellung ist weit besser als der Preis vermuten lÃ¤sst und kann sogar locker mit Mittelklasse GerÃ¤ten der 300 â¬ Klasse mithalten. Auch diese teureren GerÃ¤te besitzen durch die Bank keine 100 %tige RandschÃ¤rfe und haben FarbverlÃ¤ufe viele sogar deutlich ausgeprÃ¤gter.Wenn man sich damit Ã¼berhaupt nicht abfinden kann darf man nicht bei solchen SchnÃ¤ppchen gucken und muss bereit sein fÃ¼r die bekannten QualitÃ¤tshersteller auch schon mal eine vierstellige Summe fÃ¼r so ein Glas hinzulegen.Und selbst wenn das GerÃ¤t auf Grund einer holprigen Lieferung mal dejustiert ankommt......Anleitungen zur Selbstjustage gibt es im Netz zur GenÃ¼ge. Gerade bei den Celestron Skymaster Modellen ist das kein Problem und lÃ¤sst sich von jedem ohne Probleme selbst durchfÃ¼hren.SpÃ¤testens danach erhÃ¤lt man ein Glas was vom Nutzwert den Gegenwert weit Ã¼bersteigt und bei sachgemÃ¤Ãer Nutzung  eine Menge SpaÃ bringen kann.
5,Very good product from Celestron.Pros: Clear image good fov for star gazing.Very big aperture for a bino meaning you can see darker objects in the night sky.Cons: It's heavy to hold by hand unless you have very strong arms. 15X zoom is great but when it comes to stability it's very hard to hold it without the image shaking a lot. A tripod is almost a must
5,Out of the box the lens caps fell off but then I don't them anyway.  The first sighting presented me with a double image but after adjusting the culminating screws (Youtube for instructions) the image was superb.Not as heavy as I'd expected but for a steadier picture it is best with a tripod but get a better adapter as the plastic one supplied flaps about like a flag in a thunder storm.Overall this is a really really good piece of kit which should easily satisfy the avid astronomer and nature watcher.
5,Top GerÃ¤t top Fernglas man kann das gut in der Hand halten die VergrÃ¶Ãerung mich auch gut man muss eine gute man muss sie ruhig halten kÃ¶nnen am besten wenn man sich hinsetzt und die am besten man setzt sich am besten man setzt sich auf einen Stuhl und beobachte die Natur ich bin zufrieden Wer gefolgt versuchen denke noch ein GerÃ¤t kaufen noch ein Fernglas mit 25 mal 70 Scharfeinstellung ist auch gut sehr gute Beobachtung bei Flugobjekten Entfernung bis zu 30 Kilometer und mehr bei guter Sicht top lebe auf der Alb sehr gut getestet spreche meinenEmpfehlung top
4,Attention l'adaptateur de trÃ©pied est fourni sur la 15 X 70 mais rien n'est prÃ©vu sur la lunette pour l'adapter. Est prÃ©vu pour les modÃ¨les plus puissants.Sinon satisfait.
5,balance between weight size and magnification
4,These are the first large zoom binoculars I have owned and I am extremely happy with them.  I had to send the first pair that arrived back because they were WAY out of collimation.  This replacement pair are spot on.  having tried them out this evening for the first time actually looking at the stars etc.  I am Delighted.As an absolute novice I easily found the Andromeda galaxy Orion nebula Saturn Jupiter and its moons and this was on an evening with a 99% full moon and only breaks in the clouds!  Roll on the end of the month and darker skies!!I think they are a great starting point just to familiarise myself with the night sky a Telescope will be purchaced in the near future!
3,I bought it a week ago and it was neither collimated at all nor aligned. I wrote to Celestron official. Meanwhile I studied a lot about it about different methods and tried to collimate but there was always some issue also image wasn't criap and it was very frustrating. After waiting I got reply from Celestron and asked me to return it. It should have collimated and aligned from the manufacturer. They have very fine and expensive instrument to collimate these huge Binos though I like the Binos but my experience was bad with this purchase. Sadly I returned it.
4,Lo he probado poco aÃºn pero parece que es lo que describe el fabricante. Buena imagen durante el dÃ­a y por la noche solo he podido observar la luna y es espectacular con el tiempo y un trÃ­pode intentare disfrutar mÃ¡s de la observaciÃ³n nocturna. La caja venÃ­a envuelta en plÃ¡stico transparente un poco raro se veÃ­a perfectamente lo que era y con golpes y araÃ±ados pero el interior de la caja bien.
4,Good for beginners
5,Great quality super worthy. What you can see: The moon looks fantastic! Mars and Venus looks like bigger bright stars you can't see textures though. Saturn looks like bright dot slightly elongated but I couldn't see rings. I could count 5 moons of Jupiter. You can see WAY MORE stars and some Messier objects like Andromeda and some Nebulas (keep in mind that in normal atmospheric situation they will look faded or blurred... not Hubble like full HD :D ).You will need a GOOD tripod the binocular is heavy. Get a good tripod stable that allows you to reach a good height otherwise your neck is going to suffer.
5,The binoculars arrived in good condition with undamaged packaging. All mentioned accessories were in the box. The quality of the optics is good and as expected at this price point. Please note that these are large sized binoculars and will require a tripod if used for extended period of time. The lense covers fit well. Image quality is good with no optical aberrations. Tripod adapter came in box. Overall quality is as expected. Please note that these are not zoom binoculars but have a fixed 15x magnification which is ideal for terrestrial viewing as well as for general astronomical use (in conjunction with a telescope). Operation is simple and can be used by beginners.
5,Nicely priced good value
3,Zwei Frage hÃ¤tte ich warum enthÃ¤lt keine Zoom-Hebel und wo hingehÃ¶rt diese Einzel StÃ¼ck?
5,Das Skymaster 15x70 Fernglas von Celestron wurde am 24.12.2014 bestellt und am 02.01.2015 (wegen des Feiertags einen Tag spÃ¤ter als von Amazon versprochen) ausgeliefert.Die Verpackung der Lieferung war OK alle Teile die zum Lieferumfang gehÃ¶ren d.h. Fernglas Trageriemen dÃ¼nne minimal gepolsterte Stofftasche Stativadapter aus Kunststoff und eine Gebrauchsanweisung in mehreren Sprachen darunter auch DE waren vorhanden.Nach dem Auspacken wurde das Fenrnglas sofort ausprobiert. Es liefert auch mit Brille ein scharfes und helles Bild entfernter Objekte. Leider erwies sich der mitgelieferte Adapter aus Kunststoff als wenig brauchbar. Baut man diesen Adapter auf ein Neigekopf-Fotostativ und montiert das Fernglas (Gewicht ca. 1360 g) auf KopfhÃ¶he oben darauf dann fÃ¼hrt jede VerÃ¤nderung der Position des Fernglases dazu dass das System "Adapter + Fernglas" deutlich nachschwingt. Man muss dann warten bis die Schwingungen nach 20 - 30 Sekunden aufhÃ¶ren um ein stabiles Bild des entfernten Objekts zu erhalten.BewÃ¤hrt hat sich die Montage unter Verwendung zweier kleiner Kugelkopf-Adapter aus Metall. Der erste Kugelkopf-Adapter der an das Anschlussgewinde in der MittelbrÃ¼cke des Fernglases aufgeschraubt wird wird dabei in der um 90Â° gekippten Postion starr verschraubt. Der zweite Kugelkopf dient zum Schwenken bzw. Arretieren des Systems "Fernglas + der um 90Â° gekippte erste Kugelkopf".
4,I purchased this item on 24 Dec 2014.  One of the best binoculars simply!!!!:-)I have been using it much for terrestrial view as I have to learn more about star gazing before using it much for astronomical purpose.Definitely the best for it's price ( I bought it for 6346.00 INR).  Based on the description about the product on internet reviews by users and my own experience I gave it 4 stars:-)I have photron tripod which I bought for the purpose of star gazing and taking snaps of the same.  Any one guide me how to get a connector to connect binos with mobile/dslr/digital camera for imaging purpose or how to prepare one by our own;-)Thank you!!!!:-)
4,Good sturdy heavyweight binoculars with a good field of view and excellent for stargazing.However1. They are quite heavy so a tripod is needed for a steady view2. The provided tripod mount is rubbish buy a metal one (for about a tenner)3. The collimation was out when delivered (a common issue I believe) although this was fixed in a couple of minutes using the adjustment screws under the rubber grips (dead simple adjusted with a small screwdriver while viewing a steady object until its the same height in both lenses)Overall I'm happy especially at this price and would have given 5 stars if there was a decent mount (and strap maybe) and they were in alignment when delivered.
4,It's perfect as described u can buy without hesitation
4,It is good but needs mounting on tripod...and not for rugged use. Will be very useful in smaller towns to watch the sky where ligh pollution is less.
5,After trying out the celestron skymaster 25x70 binoculars and not being impressed by them i returned them for the 20x80's which was a bad mistake they looked like they had been opened up and tampered with the screws on the left hand side of the eyepiece were damaged ie ruffed up plus the black paint was scuffed off plus no one in the family was able to focus the left eyepiece i am in the process of returning them in the meantime i ordered the 15x20's which arrived today well we all agree in our house hold these are the best ones yet crystal clear images plus the bonus of them being a little bit lighter to hold the tripod mount does wobble a little you just have to give it a second or two to settle down but over all i would recommend the 15x20 over the other two to be honest there is not much difference in what you can see out of all three
5,Es difÃ­cil de creer que unos prismÃ¡ticos como estos salgan por solo 61 euros transporte incluido. Las prestaciones son las de unos prismÃ¡ticos mucho mÃ¡s caros..La aberraciÃ³n cromÃ¡tica es casi despreciable para unos prismÃ¡ticos de esta apertura gran nitidez. El campo se ve un poco curvado pero eso no lo veo tan importante para un uso astronÃ³mico incluso para observaciÃ³n de naturaleza es perfectamente tolerable. Tengo los 20x80 tambiÃ©n los 15x70 son mÃ¡s luminosos y se pueden usar sin trÃ­pode por un tiempo suficiente para identificar un ave a gran distancia.Lo Ãºnico que quizÃ¡ sean un poco frÃ¡giles y no creo que toleren un gran golpe habrÃ¡ que manejarlos con cuidado.Muy contento con ellos les doy un 10 y espero que esta opiniÃ³n no les haga subir de precio. :)
5,sehr gut aber etwas schwer also mit stativ benÃ¼tzen ist lieber.
4,Not value for money.
5,Really pleased with bins they have  fantastic magnification
4,The celestron 15x70 skymaster are a cheap way of getting a good large aperture binoculars. Built quality is better than i expected.I had the luck of getting a faily decent pair but quality might vary a little bitThe included tripod adapter is very bad don't use it (it's all plastic and bumps a lot with binoculars of this weight).At this size binoculars are quite heavy so make sure you get a tripod/monopod and tripod adapter.I use them primarly for stargazing and found that they perform properly and the viewing experience is good enough.Pros:-Price-Quality better than expect at this price range (but it might vary a little)Cons:-Included tripod adapter not proper for this binoculars
4,Plastic looks as though it has a gap in the body work but product seems ok.
4,Wie bereits schon Ã¶fters hier erwÃ¤hnt kommt das Fernglas oft stark dejustiert (wobei man das manchmal fast nicht mehr so nennen kann).Habe meines justiert und nach 30 Minuten zwar deckungsgleiche Bilder erhalten aber die Austrittspupille war dann nicht mehr rund. Geholfen hat nur der tausch der beiden Tuben von links nach rechts und umgekehrt. Danach nochmal justieren.Nun habe ich ein Fernglas welches fÃ¼r den Preis ein helles und gutes Bild hat. Die SchÃ¤rfe ist in der Mitte des Gesichtsfeldes nicht ganz perfekt aber Gut. Die RandunschÃ¤rfe hÃ¤lt sich auch in Grenzen. Farbfehler sind sehr gering (wirklich gut). Die manchmal beschriebenen milchigen Bildbereiche kommen von zu extremen Justierversuchen - hatte ich anfangs auch.Der Stativhalter ist nicht brauchbar fÃ¼r FernglÃ¤ser Ã¼ber 1 Kg. Hier muss ein Metallhalter her. Nach anfÃ¤nglichem Frust bin ich nun doch sehr zufrieden mit der Sternabbildung und der terrestrischen Beobachtung. Trotzdem war der Auslieferungszustand bei mir eine einzige Frechheit.FAZIT: Wer sich mit Justage beschÃ¤ftigen will macht einen guten Kauf und erhÃ¤lt ein gutes aber nicht perfektes Fernglas mit unbrauchbarem Stativadapter.
5,Ich habe seither ein Bresser 10x50 Cobra genutzt und mir dieses Fernglas nun bestellt. Es wurde Super schnell geliefert war Gut verpackt. Es sieht SchÃ¶n und Wertig aus. Die Abbildungen sind Sehr Scharf und anders als in anderen Rezessionen hatte Ich keinerlei Probleme mit den Okularen. Ich musste garnix nachstellen oder gar justieren. Wer Ahnung hat wie man ein Fernglas richtig auf seine Augen einstellt der wird an diesem GerÃ¤t seine Freude haben. Allerdings muss gesagt werden daÃ man dieses GerÃ¤t wohl besser zumindest auf einem Einbein Stativ verwenden sollte da es einfach riesig ist und es aus der Hand schwer fallen wird ein Ruhiges verwackelungfreies Bild zu sehen auch der Trageriemen ist sehr schmal Ich habe Ihn gegen einen von meiner Spiegelreflex getauscht..FÃ¼r diesen Preis ist das GerÃ¤t absolut TOP.  Auch bei Mond und Sternbeobachtung ist dieses GerÃ¤t der Hammer... Ãberlege schon mir den GroÃen Bruder mit 25facher VergrÃ¶Ãerung zu holen..Alles in Allem wÃ¼rde Ich dieses Fernglas uneingeschrÃ¤nkt weiter empfehlen
4,Its an amazing Binoculars tells what it says it does. Great magnification power good build quality. I could see the four moons of Jupiter with this one even in city lights. Binoculars are good for bigger field of view hence help you search for astronomical objects easily. To see a particular night sky object clearly and more magnified I would recommend a telescope. Due to it high magnification power the Binoculars has to be held very stable otherwise the view keeps shaking a lot. For this price I am happy that it does not come with a internal stabilizer.This binoculars is not just for the night sky but also for terrestrial viewing. A good sturdy tripod with these binoculars would be a good purchase.
5,Satisfait de mon achat.Jumelles trÃ¨s lumineuse.Permet de voir des galaxies nÃ©buleuses et autres amas d'Ã©toiles.Vous verrez Ã©galement Ã©normÃ©ment de passage de satellites artificiel invisible Ã  l'Åil nu.Pour ce qui est du planÃ©taireLa lune est trÃ¨s belle dans ces jumelles On voit trÃ¨s bien Jupiter et 4 de ses lunes on devine les anneaux de Saturne. Le grossissement est insuffisant pour voir le dÃ©tails des planÃ¨tes mais cette parties de jumelles n'est pas faites pour Ã§a
4,Dieses Fernglas ist ein schÃ¶nes Mittelding zwischen groÃem Jagdglas und kleinem Astronomieglas.Es ist ordentlich verarbeitet.Lediglich der Kunststoffhalter fÃ¼rs Stativ wackelt wie ein LÃ¤mmerschwanz.BildschÃ¤rfe und Helligkeit sind fÃ¼r den Preis sehr ordentlich. Bei Sternbeobachtungen ergeben sich saubere Lichtpunkte ohne groÃe Fransen oder Strahlen. Vielleicht habe ich aber mit GlÃ¼ck ein sehr gutes Exemplar erwischt die QualitÃ¤t ist jedenfalls deutlich besser als es der Preis erwarten lieÃ.Das Fernglas ist schon ganz schÃ¶n schwer. Es lÃ¤sst sich gerade so noch aus der freien Hand benutzen igendwo anlehnen ist sehr hilfreich.Es eignet sich hervorragend zur schnellen astronomischen Beobachtung wenn ich  keine Zeit oder Lust habe mein Spiegelteleskop aufzubauen.Keine Sensation aber fÃ¼r Einsteiger sehr gut das Preis/LeistungverhÃ¤ltnis geht sehr in Ordnung."Nur" 4 Sterne da es auf dem Stativ doch ziemlich eiert durch den schlechten Adapter...Das erste gelieferte Fernglas war vÃ¶llig dejustiert beide Tuben zeigten in verschiedene Richtungen es war unbrauchbar. RÃ¼cksendung und Ersatz klappten superschnell der Postbote der die RÃ¼cksendung abholte brachte die Ersatzsendung bereits mit. Besser gehts nicht.5 Sterne fÃ¼r Amazon mal wieder.
4,Good but too heavy. Price is relatively genuine. I returned it only for heavy weight not easy to use. It has bak7 prism but image quality is neck to neck compare to nikon aculon 10-22/50
2,Optische QualitÃ¤t der Linsen lÃ¤sst zu WÃ¼nschen Ã¼brig. Wollte das Glas zur Beobachtung des Mondes in klaren NÃ¤chten nutzen. Im Randbereich des Sichtfeldes extrem schlechte Abbildungseigenschaften. Bin enttÃ¤uscht.
5,The binoculars are excellent best ever for terrestrial and sky gazing. I got a pitch black bino (not the colour represented in picture). Its performing really well I have been using it for past 3 months and found no issues with it. If you are going to closely observe stars then you will need a tripod (any standard tripod will do). The adapter for the tripod comes with the binos so not to worry. If you hold these for too long then you might get neck pain. So I seriously recommend using tripod. I basically use it to study night sky. So if you love watching the sky every night with naked eye then this would be a great addition to your star gazing. The moon looks pretty awesome through these binos. Just read throught the amazon.com reviews about this product and you will get to know everything.EDIT: I bought "Photron Stedy Pro 560" Tripod few months ago. It really helps keep the bino steady. I'm so amazed I could spot the Jupiter with its 4 large moons.
5,Very good for moon gazing any further would be a push. Definitely needs a tripod to keep images steady (or maybe thatâs just me). Amazing quality comes with a carry bag and the image is very crisp! Would recommend and would absolutely buy again.
5,I like the optical quality.  Good for Astronomical observation.  I was able to see clearly Jupiter moons and some deep sky objectsI don't like the holder bracket mount.  It's in plastic and wobble a lot sidelay which make the observation on tripod worse than by hand.  I had to buy a new bracket and can now enjoy the full potentiel of the Binocular
4,Good for beginners. Can see moon in greater details. But couldn't see much other than it....blame it on inexperienced eyes low power and shakiness of binoculars pollutants in air. However an overall good purchase at this price....it adds value to your travel and stargazing. Go for it..
5,Ich habe nicht viel Ahnung von FernglÃ¤sern und kann dieses hier mit keinem anderen vergleichen.Das Celestron nutze ich um sog. "Deep-Sky-Objekte" wie Galaxien Sternenhaufen oder Nebel ausfindig zu machen.Das funktioniert tatsÃ¤chlich und ich war erstaunt als ich plÃ¶tzlich die Andromeda Galaxie im View hatte.WOW!Mit diesem Fernglas sieht man Dinge am Nachthimmel die man niemals mit bloÃem Auge erkennen wÃ¼rdeund mit etwas Ãbung einer guten Skymap und einer guten Adaption der Augen erkennt man sogarNebel wie den Nordamerika- oder den Triflid-Nebel. Wirklich klasse!Wenn man das Fernglas dann noch auf ein Stativ  setzz  vereinfacht es das Aufsuchen erheblich denn es ist recht schwer und lÃ¤sst sich nicht lange mit freier Hand halten mal abgesehen davon dass man fast kein ruhiges Bild bekommt.Die Verarbeitung scheint mir sehr gut zu sein die Dioptrieeinstellungen funktionieren gut und ich freue michjedesmal wenn ich das Fernrohr einsetzen kann.Fazit: UneingeschrÃ¤nkt zu empfehlen!
5,A) El paquete llegÃ³ a casa unos dÃ­as antes de lo previsto (id revisando la localizaciÃ³n por si no les pilla en casa ese dÃ­a o lo que sea).B) Respecto a la imagen destacar la gran nitidez mejor de lo que esperaba. Evidentemente se trata de un binocular para la observaciÃ³n de grandes estructuras astronÃ³micas como nebulosas cÃºmulos etc. asÃ­ como para visualizar la luna y tambiÃ©n para la observaciÃ³n diurna de pÃ¡jaros paisajes etc. Si quieren ver los anillos a Saturno quizÃ¡s sea mejor pensar en un telescopio. Resaltar que al principio parecÃ­a no encajar bien lo que veÃ­a con cada ojo y me daba la sensaciÃ³n de tener estrabismo pero simplemente habÃ­a que ir calibrÃ¡ndolo con el "rodillo" del binocular mientras miras y ya (quizÃ¡ haya quien crea que les vinieron mal porque no lo calibraron).C) En cuanto al peso (aproximadamente 13 kg) no es un problema. Yo tengo un esguince en la muÃ±eca y pude usarlo mÃ¡s de 15 mins de corrido prÃ¡cticamente y sin darme ni cuenta.Recomendable!
5,Hace mÃ¡s de un aÃ±o que comprÃ© estos prismÃ¡ticos y no puedo estar mÃ¡s satisfecho con ellos.Para los que se inician en astronomÃ­a prismÃ¡ticos y telescopios resuelta difÃ­cil elegir entre tantas opciones... Pero con estos prismÃ¡ticos es casi imposible quedar decepcionado debido a todo lo que ofrecen por su precio.Se ha tener en cuenta que es casi obligatorio un trÃ­pode para observaciones cÃ³modas sobretodo para el cielo. Si los quieres para usar en campo a mano alzada y no vas a tener trÃ­pode creo de verdad (por muy fuertes que tengas los brazos :P ) que deberÃ­as valorar mejor unos 8x50 o similar.Para el trÃ­pode se hace necesario comprar un soporte metÃ¡lico (es barato) ya que el que viene es de plÃ¡stico y no tiene estabilidad.Por Ãºltimo unos prismÃ¡ticos potentes para disfrutarlos al mÃ¡ximo durante aÃ±os se deberÃ­a saber colimar. Esto es un proceso relativamente sencillo aunque al principio como todo lo que no se sabe hacer te pueda parecer complicado.  En Internet hay cientos de artÃ­culos y ejemplos de como ajustarlos.
4,These binoculars are very good value and I was undecided whether to give the full 5 stars. The weight and the need for a tripod makes it not a piece of equipment that you can take on a leisurely walk. If you are thinking about buying a pair you should make sure you have a tripod especially if you are wanting to view something for anything longer than a few seconds. There is an easy fitting included for the tripod. Also because they are quite big - just under 11 inches from eyepiece to objective lens cover they are also quite heavy - hence the use of the tripod. They come with a carrying bag which is soft not a hard case. Overall a good product and I would recommend it  Celestron SkyMaster Binoculars 15x70        .
5,If you temper your expectations and consider the price you are paying then these are pretty good. I've only tried them out for having a look from the garden at the hills across the water and the image is acceptable. If you want something perfect optically then you will have to spend a huge amount of money. The supplied tripod mount is a bit cheap and plastic will never be as good as a lump of metal but at least you can try it and see if you need to get something stronger. They are bulky so you are unlikely to travel to far with them around your neck. So far quite impressed with them.My main uses are going to be stargazing and some bird watching and I'll update once I have some more use of them.
5,The product is mind blowing !! Seriously we can see night vision also !
3,Disappointed... You can see moon in the sky other objects are too tiny to make any sense of. Terrestrial viewing is fine but if you wish to use it for sky watching better invest in a proper telescope.
1,Das von mir erworbene Celestron 15x70 mm Fernglas zeigte ein Doppelbild beim genaueren Nachschauenentdeckte ich ein zersprungenes Glasprisma im Innern ( Schrott / MÃ¼lltonne ) kein Fernglas mehr.MfG. L.Reddig
3,Lens of both eyepiece are not aligned
5,I was advised by an astronomy expert that these binoculars were an excellent place to start to start for a beginner in sky watching.... I've had so much fun over the last few months using them.  You definitely need a tripod though to keep a steady hand gazing at the sky as they are surprisingly heavy.... Couldn't give a higher recommendation.
5,Teniendo en cuenta que son unos prismÃ¡ticos no puedes pedir ver todo lo que se ve con un telescopio.para eso comprate un telescopio(ojoson tres veces mÃ¡s caros y tampoco ves mucho mas).pesan lo suyo asÃ­ que si no tienes buen pulso necesitas un trÃ­pode.yo estoy contento con la comprade echo me encantan
4,Having read conflicting reviews I cautiously purchased these binos they arrived and... Brilliant!Very robust good quality and well designed they look good too. I think the price is very good too. Crisp clear image and no problems with collimation as reported by a few reviews. Easy to perform the initial set-up and the tripod adapter works really well.Not as heavy as I was expecting although I brought a monopod in the end which gives me the perfect mix of stability and manouverability with less weight.What have I seen so far: Lots of clouds (I live in London) The Full Moon with such clear detail of craters and blemishes and all and Jupiter and 4 of its Moons (amazing to see sometinh so far away as almost pea-sized).
4,La calidad de la imagen es muy buena. Gran alcance para un uso astronÃ³mico. Tienen el inconveniente del peso. Recomendables de cualquier modo
4,Pensaba comprarme un telescopio ya que mi intenciÃ³n era observar el cielo sus estrellas y sus planetas. Pero tras consultar en varios foros de astronomÃ­a me decidÃ­ por unos binoculares astronÃ³micos ya que para un presupuesto bajo recomiendan comprar mejor unos binoculares astronÃ³micos que un telescopio.Y dentro del presupuesto que yo me querÃ­a gastar encontrÃ© estos binoculares.No son los mejores pero como digo por este precio merecen la pena. Tienen un objetivo amplio y por lo tanto captan bastante luz. Eso sÃ­ el problema es que son dificiles de manejar por su peso y por sus aumentos ya que resulta difÃ­cil al observar el cielo mantenerlos en un punto fijo sin que se te muevan. Se necesitarÃ­a un buen tripode. Pero de todas formas tampoco es imprescindible mÃ¡s o menos te puedes apaÃ±ar.Lo que digo una buena elecciÃ³n calidad-precio.
5,I bought these for my sons birthday as heâs very much into star gazing and he absolutely loved them. Although they are quite heavy for him to use unaided I also bought a tripod so he can be hands free when using. Very clear vision and easy to use I highly recommend these if you have a budding astronomer in the family!
5,Bought these for my wife to stargaze and watch the wildlife around our place great binoculars.Without a tripod these are the absolute maximum magnification I would go to otherwise youâll never keep it steady.I brace myself off something like a doorway or tree to steady the view.
4,Stand is a must buy..
4,This is a small sized telescope. Though a bit heavy to hold for a long time. It is advisable to buy a tripod stand along with it. The zoom is very good. Can see Orion Nebula 4 moons of Jupiter craters of moon far away objects like ships and boats on the horizon of the sea trekkers on a mountain etc. i bought this product because I wanted a binoculars which I can carry around anywhere and which is equivalent to a beginners telescope
4,La calidad de los prismÃ¡ticos es muy buena en general. El Ãºnico defecto es que tiene un adaptador para trÃ­pode bastante endeble y que conviene cambiar por otro mejor. Pero por todo lo demÃ¡s funcionan de maravilla.Eso sÃ­ hay que tener en cuenta de que estos ya son unos binoculares de un tamaÃ±o importante y el peso que tienen hace que tengas que usar trÃ­pode porque si no los brazos se te cansan enseguida.TambiÃ©n hay que considerar que al tener tantos aumentos las vibraciones son inevitables y muy molestas si no usas trÃ­pode.En resumidas cuentas con trÃ­pode son unos prismÃ¡ticos estupendos pero si no tienes pensado adquirir uno hazte con unos binoculares algo mÃ¡s pequeÃ±os por ejemplo de 10x50 que tambiÃ©n van muy bien.
3,I did the research before purchase and was generally satisfied these binoculars represented good value for the price - and for some people they are fine. I just wasn't satisfied with the overall quality and decided to return for a better quality binocular - but not to put people off these good value and they will do the job.. but not for me
5,Son buenos prismÃ¡ticos con mucha luz pero debido a su peso hay que usarlos con un trÃ­pode que les de estabilidad. Al tener muchos aumentos cualquier pequeÃ±o movimiento se nota mucho. Lo ideal ya puestos es acoplarles una cÃ¡mara CCD y asÃ­ no se tocan nada.
5,These binoculars were bought for stargazing and birding watching use and are great for both.  A little on the heavy side for general use but I am used to them now and very pleased with them.  I usually prop them up on whatever is available but they can be supported on a camera tripod.  I do not generally bother carrying one around with me.  I have a smaller pair of 10x50 for general use but always take my Skymasters with me too as there is a marked difference when looking at the night sky and over longer distances when birding.  Perhaps if I had to be a little critical the eye rubber could be just a little softer but I believe it is getting so with use.
4,Good for seeing the moon but not so good for planets. It does come with a mount for a tripod so not sure why Amazon often displays it with a separate tripod mount. It works well for looking at the ships leaving harbour.
5,Das Skymaster 15x70 ist wirklich ein gutes Fernglas. Es hat eine hohe LichtstÃ¤rke ist sehr robust gebaut nicht zu schwer und lÃ¤sst sich sehr bequem auch bei lÃ¤ngeren Wanderungen tragen. Durch die gummierte OberflÃ¤che liegt es sehr geschmeidig in der Hand und vertrÃ¤gt auch kleine StÃ¶Ãe und Rempler ganz gut. Man darf fÃ¼r diesen Preis allerdings keine optische HighendqualitÃ¤t erwarten. Leichte UnschÃ¤rfen im Randbereich sowie eine deutliche chromatische Aberration bei sehr starken Kontrasten muss man einfach in Kauf nehmen. Dennoch lassen sich anvisierte Objekte scharf darstellen und gut beobachten. Den im Lieferumfang befindlichen Stativadapter kann man allerdings komplett vergessen. Er ist aus Plastik und federt derart nach dass ein ruhiges Beobachten vom Stativ aus fast unmÃ¶glich wird. Der geringste Hauch am Stativ oder am Fernglas und das Herumgetanze geht los und kriegt sich fast nicht mehr ein. Ich hatte mir vorsorglich den "GALAXSTER extra stabiler Stativadapter aus Metall" fÃ¼r knapp 15-EUR gekauft und bin in dieser Kombination sehr zufrieden.
5,I use a Celestron 8SE telescope and this binocular really complements it very nicely. The build quality if excellent the optics are up to mark. I use it to watch the night sky and have been watching the orion nebula with ease.They are a bit heavy and without a tripod your hands tire out for long term watching. Also the shake factor multiplies manifold. Use this with a good tirpod to really enjoy the full potential of this binocular.I used it for terrestrial deer watching and it was well worth carrying this big binocular.
5,After owning a couple of telescopes and getting these for portability I can't fault the quality of these. VERY solid construction feel very nice in the hands and the clarity of the moon and constellations is unbelievable. I didn't think binoculars could give such impressive views!
4,We bought these binoculars to look at the night sky whilst on holiday. Unfortunately it was too cloudy however they are quite heavy and hard to navigate to what you want to look at. We primarily use these for looking at the moon/clouds/landscape but feel that a tripod would really help primarily to stop your arms aching and to also provide a non shaky view.
3,Man sollte bedenken dass es sich um ein Spezialglas zur Himmelsbeobachtung handelt. Es ist zwar auch tagsÃ¼ber eine Freude durchzuschauen aber die GrÃ¶Ãe und das Gewicht verhindern doch meist die Mitnahme auf Wanderungen.An sich hat das Glas gute bis sehr gute Helligkeit und SchÃ¤rfeleistung. UrsprÃ¼nglich wollte ich das Glas zurÃ¼ckschicken weil sich jedes mal beim an die Augen drÃ¼cken die SchÃ¤rfe Ã¤nderte. Das ist meist ein Problem von BilligglÃ¤sern mit PlastikbrÃ¼cken (das Teil dass die Okulare mit der Scharfstellachse verbindet). Diese BrÃ¼cken verbiegen sich einfach bei leichtem Druck und defokusieren deswegen.Dann habe ich aber die Okulare abgeschraubt und doch eine MetallbrÃ¼cke vorgefunden. Schrauben ordentlich festgezogen - und jetzt bleibt die SchÃ¤rfe gut erhalten. Die Okulare wackelten vorher einfach mit der BrÃ¼cke hin und her. Die Okulare sind Ã¼brigens 3-Linser aus Glas.Das Glas hat recht starke FarbsÃ¤ume. Wenn meine Frau (technischer Laie) durch das Glas den Mond anschaut ist sie wegen der Helligkeit SchÃ¤rfe und Details schwer begeistert. Aber Sie hat auch sofort gefragt warum der Mond oben und unten so farbige RÃ¤nder hat ;-) Auch Sterne sind nur im Zentrum unverfÃ¤lscht einfarbig.Man bekommt was man zahlt: Hell Scharf groÃes Sichtfeld aber auch schlechte Montage/Endkontrolle (man muss selbst justieren) und doch auch fÃ¼r Laien auffÃ¤llige FarbsÃ¤ume.Aber trotzdem schaue ich sehr gerne den Mond und die Sterne mit dem Glas. FÃ¼r den doppelten Preis hÃ¤tte ich mir wahrscheinlich nicht so ein Spezialglas zugelegt.
5,Can see moon craters Jupiter looking very prominent. Also can see few stars which not visible thru naked eye.
5,These binoculars are good value. They give a sharp image with only brighter stars causing any chromatic distortion (but that happens with more expensive products too). They are quite heavy necessarily to accommodate the large lens aperture. Because the magnification is x15 any slight movement of your hands holding them will be magnified and probably some sort of stabilising/tripod system would be ideal
5,I just bought this bino.i have so many doubts about transportation security.so many people says about the collimation problem due to transportation .so most of them are unwilling to buy these items through online.The fact is that u must expect a collimation problem.but the happy news is that it is a very easy  to correct collimation.there are lots of videos on YouTube.Yesi corrected collimation.Overall the product is superb and the packaging is good.What about tripod.every newcomer like me think that they can handle it without tripod.after a week they must search for a good tripod for nightsky observation.
5,Nach einigen schlechten Bewertungen und Infos dass man nachjustieren mÃ¼sse hatte ich mich bei der Bestellung darauf eingestellt und nicht allzu groÃe Erwartungen gehabt. Aber: Ich habe mir zwei Skymaster gekauft das 15x70 und das 25x70 beide fÃ¼r Plane Spotting und bisschen Sterne schauen und an beiden habe ich nichts auszusetzen. Sehr gute wirklich sehr gute SchÃ¤rfe bei beiden keine Notwendigkeit etwas nachzujustieren wobei ich aber beide auf einem Stativ nutze. Wenn ich mit anderen mehr als doppelt so teuren FernglÃ¤sern vergleiche die ich noch besitze dann bin ich umso mehr erstaunt Ã¼ber diese AbbildungsqualitÃ¤t der beiden GlÃ¤ser. Vielleicht habe ich mit meinen beiden Modellen GlÃ¼ck gehabt ich kann es nicht sagen aber so wie sie sind eine absolute Empfehlung. Die angegebenen Naheinstellgrenzen darf man allerdings nicht so ernst nehmen da muÃ man schon noch ein paar ordentliche Meter drauf packen.
5,SInce my wife died a few months ago I need a reason to go out. I drive either to woods and watch the wildlife or the coast to watch the ships etc. I use hese binoculars to do that. They are pretty good for moonwatching as well.
4,Received within 24 hours of ordering and after about 5 to 10 minutes of setting them up for the best focus I can happily say I can see the moon with great detail. Luckily tonight is pretty much a clear sky. Very happy I purchased these. Will be waiting for an hour prior to dawn to see other planets with better visibility.  Only negative they are quite heavy so if you do not have a tripod it would be best to invest in a sturdy one
5,Cannot fault these binos so far. I use them for stargazing and helping find objects for my telescope. Excellent clarity of view managed to find Orion Nebula Andromeda Galaxy and a few other Messier Objects (so far!). Excellent value for money for me.
3,Did not receive rain cover as mentioned in box..
5,Great bins for the money. I use mainly for astronomy and the extra wide objective lens bring in a lot of light. This coupled with a strong 15x magnification make the instrument very useful for stargazing. The views of the moon are very clear and sharp even at the edges. However they are large quite heavy and are best used with a tri-pod to get the best views. Alternatively the user should be sat down or even lying down and allow the weight to be taken on off the arms which can soon tire. For the money you would be hard pressed to get better. I also have a 20x80 pair same make and I can recommend these also.
4,Excelente relaÃ§Ã£o qualidade preÃ§o
5,First of all I don't give a flying f about celestial bodies . I bought this for other purposes . If you have other purposes too other than watching moon  surely go for it  u won't be disappointed . The only downside is that it's damn heave so biy a tripod too .
4,It is amazing what you can see with this bino. The moon is crisp and craters can be viewed beautifully. Jupiter is too bright so it's weather pattern cannot be seen it's moons are seen as dots but effortless. Orion nebula is breathtaking. In the end I would say that it is great purchase. Only con I would say is its weight.
5,You'll definitely need a tripod for it to be of any use. Collamation was perfect when received. I could see the radar on top of a light house rotating 15kms away.
5,My man loved these. They were bought as a Christmas present. He loves them he uses them to look at the stars can you believe it? Not just for birds and when we go on drives but the stars they are super powerful. Easier and quicker to use than the telescopes
4,RelaciÃ³n calidad-precio buena.
3,Did not perform to my expectations.  One of the lens was out of focus so I was seeing different focused views in either eyepiece ended up returning for a refund.  Overall it's not very good for viewing planets I could not get a good view of Jupiter it was tiny and I could just about make out the moons.  Orion nebula was OK but both Jupiter and Orion Nebula are better viewed from my Skywatcher 150p telescope.  The portability of the binoculars and lack of clarity and magnification of images doesn't justify the price for me to pay for these binoculars.  Handling wise I didn't find them heavy I could hold them without too much shaking although for longer viewing I would recommend a tripod.  If I was to buy another pair of binoculars I would buy some that have a higher magnification than 15x and perhaps more than 70mm aperture with a tripod.
5,Ces jumelles de grossissement x15 et de 70 mm d'ouverture sont d'excellente facture l'image y est nette et bien lumineuse. Pour un prix de 90 euros c'est une trÃ¨s bonne affaire sachant que les prix grimpent trÃ¨s vite dans cette catÃ©gorie sans que cela aille nÃ©cessairement de pair avec la qualitÃ©.Le seul bÃ©mol est le poids: 12 kg. Elles nÃ©cessitent donc une bonne musculature Ã  l'usage. Elles sont cependant livrÃ©es avec un socle qui permet de pouvoir les installer sur un trÃ©pied photographique ce qui apporte la stabilitÃ© de l'image importante pour l'observation longue.Une sacoche souple molletonnÃ©e est aussi fournie pour le transport.Disposant par ailleurs d'un tÃ©lescope d'une puissance optique sans comparaison mais dont le revers de la mÃ©daille est le temps de mise en station ces jumelles me permettent l'observation directe au dÃ©bottÃ©.
4,Really great quality comfortable to hold and easy to ajust.
5,TrÃ¨s bon matÃ©riel.IdÃ©al pour les balades en montagne ou en bord de mer.Content de mon achat surtout pour le prix.
5,i originally bought the Celestron Skymaster 20-100x70. they were rubbish. totally unusable. 25x is the highest usable magnification for a 70mm lens in this price range. i returned them and this seller was great. no trouble at all. so i bought these the 15x70. theyre perfect. very good product for the price. no theyre not the best binoculars in the world but they are the best value by far. you get infinitely more than you pay for. the 15x mag is the most you would want if you plan on using these hand held most of the time. anything more like the celestron skymaster 25x70 and you will probably need a tripod to get a stable image.
4,Great for the moonSaw loads more stars in the sky with them but not much better detail
5,Very good
5,This meets all of my requirements.
5,I am new to astronomy and decided to go for binoculars before I consider a telescope. These binoculars are very very solid and are clearly of great quality. The magnification is good for the moon and is just enough to separate the planets from the stars (obviously the magnification can't compete with a telescope). The light gathering is excellent you can point them at a seemingly "starless" area of sky and be blown away by how much is revealed.I bought these with a Hama Star 63 tripod and would recommend doing this. The tripod makes observing much more enjoyable. The binoculars come with a tripod mount which is ok but I opted to buy a more solid one separately.
5,Jumelles formidables de trÃ¨s bonne qualitÃ© emballage et envoie trÃ¨s rapide. A conseiller au TOP !!
5,Das Celestron 15x70 ist schlicht grandios die Leistungen wurden bereits in den vorherigen Rezensionen ausgiebig gewÃ¼rdigt und ich kann sie nur bestÃ¤tigen.Gestochen scharfe Bilder lediglich am Bildfeldrand ist ein leichter Farbfehler + UnschÃ¤rfe bemerkbar die jedoch bei Beobachtungen ohne Stativ durch das unvermeidliche Zittern Ã¼berlagert wird. Apropos Zittern: lÃ¤sst sich minimieren indem das Fernglas nahe am Objektiv angefasst wird und die Arme abgestÃ¼tzt werden (Liegestuhl hilft). Astrobeobachtungen (Innenstadtlage): Kugelsternhaufen (M13 M92 M3) sind sofort zu finden und lohnende Objekte offene Sternhaufen und der Mond sind grandios die Jupitermonde und Titan sehr gut sichtbar auch Rhea sieht man zweifelsfrei. Planeten sind wegen der geringen VergrÃ¶Ãerung erwartungsgemÃ¤Ã nicht so spektakulÃ¤r den Saturnring konnte ich nicht sicher identifizieren (z.Z. weniger als 2Â° Neigung). DafÃ¼r entschÃ¤digt ein Spaziergang durch die MilchstraÃe...Fazit: Die perfekte ErgÃ¤nzung zum Teleskop aber auch fÃ¼r Tierbeobachtungen usw. ein Genuss. Mein gutes altes Carl Zeiss Jena 10x50 Multi-Coated hat nicht annÃ¤herend diese BildqualitÃ¤t.
5,Estoy encantado con los Skymaster 15Ã70. Llevo tres semanas con ellos ( me perdÃ­ la sÃºper luna del 9 de septiembre por un dÃ­a ). Tengo la suerte que desde casa tengo una muy buena visiÃ³n del cielo nocturno pero ya he realizado cuatro salidas nocturnas al campo. El codo de Mirfak Andromeda M13 Las PlÃ©yades... Junto con el planisferio alguna otra guÃ­a que he comprado y el trÃ­pode ( para mi imprescindible ) estoy pasando unas veladas nocturnas solitarias preciosas.Por 127 euros comprÃ© los prismÃ¡ticos el trÃ­pode el planisferio y el adaptador del trÃ­pode para los prismÃ¡ticos ( el que viene con los prismÃ¡ticos es muy endeble ).Absolutamente recomendable para toda aquella persona que quiera comenzar a mirar el cielo que nos rodea sin tener que dejarse un pastizal.Mi siguiente paso?? Un telescopio OriÃ³n Xt8i con montura Dobson y a seguir disfrutando....
3,Shakey
5,Es bastante menos pesado de lo que pensaba lo que aumenta mucho su comodidad de manejo. Resistente al agua (salpicaduras). Buena distancia lente/ojo para usuarios con gafas.
4,No estÃ¡ mal para el precio. Se aprecian con claridad los satÃ©lite de JÃºpiter. Imagen clara. Bien para iniciados o por si no quieres cargar con el telescopio.
5,Wife was over the moon with her gift.Only criticism was the plastic tripod bracket that comes with the item - itâs too flimsy so a rigid metal one was needed.
4,Value for money hobbyist binoculars.  Minor dislike is the bracket to fix to tripod which is made of plastic and could be a bit more sturdy.
5,Largest binoculars I have owned but far from cumbersome. Superb feel so easy to set up the focus and THE most sharp images I have ever seen. Not used the tripod stand/fitting yet but because of the power these binoculars have I understand why a tripod would be a good asset. I read the reviews - somewhat sceptically - but went ahead with the purchase.Really glad I bought them. As well as stargazing etc these are ideal for everyday use although obviously not pocket sized! Looking forward to a clear night and especially the Space Station as it next is in view.Fabulous binoculars & highly recommended.
4,Simple to use.Nice quality.Little heavy.
5,Good Product for beginners and Value for money.I bought this special for celestial event of Saturn and Jupiter. The Ring's of Saturn were visible and my son loved it.
4,You can make out some deep field features of the night sky like constellations and planets which aren't visible to the naked eye (Pleiades and a couple of moons around Saturn spring to mind).  Useful binoculars for when there is a full moon.  Also when the ISS goes overhead you can see it as a bright object but I just wish I could zoom in some more to see extra details.
5,Fantastic pair of binoculars for the money. Great for looking at the stars etc and great for taking into the mountains. Not overly heavy either but tripod would be better for prolonged looking just to keep still.
5,I'm very impressed with the binoculars as a newbi to sky watching it has been a revelation to the amounts one can see in the night sky planets and moons star systems mesmerising  with just binoculars..wow...
4,product is very good.but seller have to check the product before shipping.I have to replace it.
5,These are fab bit on the heavy side but good magnification great to see what the neighbours are up to. Plus I don't have to buy a paper now as can read there is they are holding it upright! These are good for spotting planes and long range there are better ones out there for general use and bird spotting and sport as these are on the heavy side to keep holding.
5,First impression was wow !!! I bought it for my dad as a gift because he is a hunter and I thought it will be nice present for him !! I literally love it ! The quality is soooo good ! The package came so well wrapped !! Just amazing! Thank you!!
5,NÃ©ophyte en astronomie je prends un Ã©norme plaisir. Elles sont parfaites pour tout dÃ©buter veuillent s'exercer avant de passer Ã  un level au dessus.Bonne qualitÃ© de produit!
5,It was either binoculars or telescopes and I am glad I chose this as it is more portable. Itâs a little heavy for holding a period of time so for star gazing I would definitely recommend putting it on a tripod. Otherwise it is as advertised.
4,I am no expert but have as a hobbyist used spotter scopes and binoculars on a regular basis. These are not the best pair of binoculars I have ever used (they were a pair from the RSPB). The image is good but not without some loss of dynamism. It just didn't feel crisp. However I am not disappointed as the price was reasonable.
4,It is very good as per expectations
1,Need to return these the optics  are all off shame as they look and fill  good..WHO DO I CONTACT ????
5,Miles better with the naked eye but I did my best with an iPhone 7.Canât go wrong with these binoculars best Iv ever had so easy to use and very clear!You wonât be disappointed.
4,Excellent
5,Superb set of binoculars. Especially for my first pair. But due to the magnification a tripod will give better use of these brilliant binoculars. Amazing just looking through them at the sky at night. So many more visible stars.
5,Schnelle Lieferung! Das Fernglas kam sehr gut verpackt an. Als ZubehÃ¶r werden Abdeckkappen fÃ¼r die Okulare ein Reinigungstuch ein Stativadapter und ein Riemen zum UmhÃ¤ngen mitgeliefert. Es ist ein eher schweres und groÃes GerÃ¤t welches gestochen scharfe Bilder liefert. Ich hatte zuerst einen Reflektor um Sterne zu beobachten. Allerdings ist das Fernglas nicht nur praktischer da man es auch anderweitig einsetzen und eben Ã¼berall mit hin nehmen kann. Man sieht auch ausreichend gut die HimmelskÃ¶rper. In einem Liegestuhl im Garten kann man das Fernglas auch recht ruhig halten ohne es auf ein Stativ klemmen zu mÃ¼ssen. FÃ¼r einen AnfÃ¤nger mehr als ausreichend. Empfehlenswert!
4,HabÃ­a leÃ­do varios comentarios de que venÃ­an mal colimados y tenÃ­a mis dudas. De hecho me costÃ³ tiempo decidirme por lo arriesgado de la compra. Me llegaron perfectamente bien colimados se ve muy bien y estoy muy contento. Eso sÃ­ pesan lo suyo pero con eso ya contaba. Material de calidad suficiente agradable al tacto y robustos.  La funda es una mierdecilla como la correa de colgar pero las tapas se sujetan bien. Esto es importante para proteger las lentes de la suciedad. No sÃ© si he tenido buena suerte o es lo normal.
4,Holding the binoculars for more than 2 min is difficult.. you need support ...with proper mounting image is quit clear...Very good for watching moon.Not able to get a sharp image of Jupiter and Saturn..Able to see Jupiter's 4 moons.
4,For the price these are very good binocs.
5,Received in excellent condition I was skeptical at first but all my doubts about this products how blown away. Coming to the product it's build quality is excellent and the lens are beautifully crafted. The tripod mount is sadly plastic and wobbles slightly when mounted which could have been better. This binoculars are the best bang for buck on the market. It comes with lens cap for all 3 parts
4,This is a good option for the beginners.
5,Good for begineers and casual
4,Jumelles puissantes bonne visibilitÃ© luminositÃ© moyenne lourdes.
5,Best binoculars ever tried and I am amazed with pic quality but would recommend tripod to keep perfectly steady as from hand could be a bit wobblyBit heavy but what would you expect according to the size
5,loved the crisp and sharp views no abberation but if your going to consider thesen 100% invsest in a tripod i personally went for this https://www.amazon.co.uk/Manfrotto-Compact-Advanced-Aluminium-Tripod/dp/B00K0P067W/ref=sr_1_5?crid=3BALPQUCXR0DN&dchild=1&keywords=manfrotto+tripod&qid=1588519194&sprefix=manfrotto+%2Caps%2C184&sr=8-5 but as long as it states it can take 1.6kg then you should be fine.
5,I bought this as a present and it is valued by the recipient. You can actually get a very clear view of the moon and itâs surfaces. Originally intended for bird watching they are much better than expected
4,Nice but I received a little defected one which I couldnot exchange.
5,Bit heavy but expected.
5,Used these for stargazing! A little heavy after a while !! But worth it as the view of the moon was amazing!
2,I bought these to have something that would gather a lot of light for binocular astronomy. I haven't yet had the chance to use them for that but have tested them out for normal daytime viewing. I have to say that optically these are pretty poor. There is only any sharpness in the very centre of the image and colour fringing is obvious. They are big and heavy but the tripod mount supplied isn't very rigid. My advice; save up for something better !
3,Not as good as I hoped. Ok but can not see planets as clear as I had hoped. Even with a tripod itâs hard to keep it still
3,Habe das Fernglas zum gelegentlichen Sterne gucken angeschafft. Nach der hier oft beschriebenen Justage war es auch gut zu gebrauchen. Dazu habe ich es auf mein Fotostativ mit dem  beiliegendem Adapter befestigt. Der Adapter an sich ist instabil. Das Fernglas wackelt schwingt regelrecht darauf.  Das habe ich behoben indem ich diesen StÃ¤nder mit Epoxyd Harz vergossen habe.Nach gut 2 Jahren nun hat sich die Aufnahme am Fernglas fÃ¼r diesen StÃ¤nder verabschiedet. Er wird in eine HÃ¼lse geschraubt die das ganze Fernglas zusammenhÃ¤lt. Diese HÃ¼lse ist wie auf dem Foto zu erkennen kurz nach der ersten Aufnahme weggebrochen. Die beiden Seiten sind somit nicht mehr fest miteinander verbunden und das Fernglas ist somit Schrot. Schade. Kaufe es nicht noch einmal schaue mich nach etwas anderem um.

4,Muy buenos prismÃ¡ticos para ver el cielo y las estrellas e incluso la luna en las noches de primavera y verano al aire libre.Lastima que su peso sea tan elevado y cueste mantener la postura.
5,first pair of binoculars.  They are heavy and you will need to have a tripod........  very pleased with the clarity for astronomy viewing
5,These were recommended as a really good quality pair of binoculars for the amateur astronomer. I'm delighted. They are heavy as expected from binoculars of this magnification but are fantastic for moon gazing and also basic star gazing. I found they are best with a tripod to keep them steady. They come with their own bag and lens caps etc and are easy to focus. A great find I would recommend to anyone who wants to see the moon as they have never seen with their own eyes before.
1,These are completely useless. I couldn't get them to focus at all even following the directions in the meagre booklet provided with the binoculars at least not so it was sharp - my phone camera does a better job. Having focussed them as well as was possible it's impossible to see through them with both eyes at the same time like I can with my free National Trust binoculars with these binoculars I doubt I will ever use them and wish I hadn't wasted my money.My son is going to try them out and see if he can make any use out of them. We were viewing the craters on Mars with the free 10x National Trust binoculars but with these we can't even view the trees down the far end of the road (which are further away than the minimum focus distance).
3,Great for views but I wouldn't recommend for star gazing I brought tripod I found it too low
5,Celestron 71009 15 x 70 Skymaster Porro Prism Binoculars        after reading loads of reviews decided to go with these binos. bought of amazon good price quick delivery really pleased with them. only mistake I made was believing people who wrote about tripod adaptor being useless I believed them and bought metal adaptor before recieving bino's so I was ready for when they came. waste of money supplied adaptor that comes with the bins are perfectly acceptable no flex and strong enough to support bins on ( Manfrotto) tripod. so my advice is wait and try before buying metal adaptor and save your money.
5,Amazing Binocs just Go for It.....
4,Die Optik des Fernglases ist erstaunlich gut kalibriert und eingestellt fÃ¼r chinesische QualitÃ¤tsansprÃ¼cheso dass man nur die persÃ¶nliche Einstellung wie SchÃ¤rfe und Dioptrin am Fernglas einstellen mussallerdings sollte man wissendass man ein Stativ benutzen sollte fÃ¼r eine zitterfreie Beobachtung von weiteren Objekten z.b. Mond etc.FÃ¼r richtige Himmelsobjekte sollte man natÃ¼rlich zu Teleskopen greifen.Einziger Kritikpunkt ist der Schutzdeckel fÃ¼r die Okularediese sind sehr locker und halten nicht ordentlich bei Bedeckung der Optik nach Gebrauch.Ansonsten fÃ¼r  normalen Gebrauch z.b. AlpenwanderungenNaturbeobachtunge etc.bietet das Fernglas ein gutes PreisleistungsverhÃ¤ltnis.Achtungdas ist ein grosses Fernglas und kein Spielzeugfernglas fÃ¼r Theaterbesuche etc. aufgund seiner optischen Ausstattung.Fazit:empfehlenswert fÃ¼r normale AnsprÃ¼che
5,I had celestron 15x70s a few years back which went out of collimation.  But I took a punt on these due to bargain price.  Early days yet but good views of several Messier objects so far even with a bright moon.. You will need a good quality tripod for these as they are heavy - 2.4 kilos  My 30 quid tripod could not handle them.  In the end i got a carbon fibre tripod from KF concept which cost more than the binos.  MUCH better.They do not focus very near so maybe not so good for birders unless you are watching cliff birds!I hope these last longer then the 15x70s!
5,This is my first experience! n celestron satisfied me wat I was looking as my new hobby! My first view at Jupiter planet! It's ten times clearer than wat I upload (in the picture).
5,15 x 70 - das richtige "GeschÃ¼tz" um am Strand an der Elbe den Schiffen aufzulauern. Man sollte auf jeden Fall das Fernglas auf ein Stativ setzten (Adapter beigefÃ¼gt) sonst wird man in kurzer Zeit die Lust an der Freude verlieren. FreihÃ¤ndig ist bei dem Eigengewicht des Glases nur kurzfristig zu halten.Zusammenfassung: Tolles Glas super Angebot (unter 80.- â¬) Lieferzeit klasse keine Justierung nÃ¶tig (wie man es erwartet). Hat man noch kein Stativ sollten die paar Talerchen investiert werden. Volle Empfehlung.
5,kann ich uneingeschrÃ¤nkt weiterempfehlen.Mus dazu sagen dass ich vor einer ganzen weile das Celestron SkyMaster 25x70 Fernglas fÃ¼r die Astronomie angeschafft hatte.Von daher ging ich davon aus auch dieses nach zu justieren zu mÃ¼ssen.Weit gefehlt dass Celestron SkyMaster 15x70 Fernglas war korrekt und justiert.Ach ja und ich hatte es Ã¼ber amazonwarehouse gekauft ging also davon aus dass es evtl. einige Macken haben kÃ¶nnte.Bin jedoch mehr als zufrieden.Empfehle jedoch fÃ¼r lÃ¤ngere Benutzung ein Dreibein Stativ mindestens jedoch ein Einbein Stativ zu benutzen.
5,Halloaufgrund der vielen positiven Berichte ist auch meine Wahl auf das Skymaster 15x70 gefallen.Wie immer liefert AMAZON alles super schnell und sehr gut verpackt.Beim ersten durchblicken ist man vÃ¶llig fasziniert von der QualitÃ¤t des Glases. Bezogen auf den Preis einzigartig. Hervorzuheben ist auch die lebenslage Garantie auf das Glas.Einzig bei der Verarbeitung ist mir an der rechten Augenmuschel ein QualitÃ¤tsmangel aufgefallen. (Gummi ist etwas schrÃ¤g abgeschnitten).Aber wen interessiert sowas? Ein Fernglas soll das machen wozu es gebrauch wird. Ein gutes Bild darstellen. Und das macht es. Ob nun die Abdeckungen besser befestigt werden kÃ¶nnte oder der Halsriemen breiter sein kÃ¶nnte.... ist mir eigentlich egal.Ich finde es perfekt fÃ¼r mich als Laien zugeschnitten und schlieÃe mich den anderen Anmerkungen voll an.MfG Andreas
4,Heavy binoculars but when you get the right angle and distance between your eyes and the viewfinder it gives a very wide and expansive view.Nice for stargazing due the the extra wide lenses.Good for general use also just take a little practice to get your eyes in the right place and do some weight training or get a tripod!
5,Bought these with nothing to compare them to but am very happy I did. Not as heavy as some reviews make out although they are best viewed mounted on a tripod. The mount adapter included is perfectly adequate to hold them steady. I use a reasonable quality camera tripod and all fits perfectly. Very easy to set up ready to use in a couple of minutes.Clear viewing and a wide field. It's been cloudy since I got them(typical)but I have managed a couple of clear nights and can see the moon's craters.I bought them when they were down to Â£56 so am totally happy with that!
5,These binoculars met all my expectations and serve their purpose well. I myself do not find them too heavy to hold for a while but a tripod or some support is necessary when stargazing as it is very difficult to hold them still and the slightest little movement causes the image to shake around. Though 10x magnification seems to be recommended by the experts for this purpose giving a good wide view I have not found the extra magnification a disadvantage in this respect. It seems easy to target any object and the extra magnification is a bonus. A highly commendable product.
5,Quality of objects appeared to be clear and sharp. This 15x70 Binoculars outperformed others expensive ones very easily. Steady and much easier to use without tripods. Very good value for money and impressive item. Very pleased. Definitely recommend this for anyone.
5,Great for stargazing bird watching plane spotting etc. Heavy though so will definitely need high quality and sturdy tripod for support
2,Nach langer Zeit wollte ich mein altes Hobby Astronomie wiederbeleben. Um erstmal zu schauen ob ich dran bleibe mit dem Sternegucken habe ich mir hier bei Amazon das Celestron 15x70 + Stativ + Metall-Stativ-Adapter fÃ¼r FernglÃ¤ser geordert. Meine Erwartungen waren denke ich nicht all zu hoch. Klar wird es Unterschiede im Vergleich zu einem 600 â¬ Glas aufwÃ¤rts geben. ich habe insgesamt zwei GlÃ¤ser diesen Typs bestellt und musste leider beide reklamieren. Das Erste hatte bei meiner ersten Nachtbeobachtung vor allen Dingen das Problem dass Jupiter zwar zu sehen war nicht jedoch als Scheibe sondern als unfÃ¶miges Etwas mit Schweifbildung in der Mitte. TagsÃ¼ber hatte ich immer das GefÃ¼hldass es Unscharf ist ( GefÃ¼hlt 2 Drittel des Gesichtsfeldes). AuÃerdem ein generell milchiges Bild. Die Okularscharfstellung war bei mir erst im Minusanschlag halbwegs akzeptabel - Ich habe gute Augen !! Also -> Reklamation. Das zweite Glas war grundsÃ¤tzlich besser allerdings auch hier bei der Jupiterbeobachtung ein Schweif zu sehen. Ist wohl GlÃ¼cksache ob man bei diesem Billigglas einen positiven Treffer landet.Ich habe mir jetzt bei Teleskop-express.de ein TS20x80 Triplet und von Manfrotto einen Magic-Arm zur Montage an einen Liegestuhl bestellt.Schauen wir mal was da bei rum kommt.
4,estan bien no pesan nada en comparaciÃ³n al tamaÃ±o que tienen pero no te pienses que tienen mucha potencia ni vas a ver el cielo muy cerca y bonito debes tener una vista de lince lo primero o usar gafas graduadas eso lo primero y luego estar en lugares muy oscuros y tal para que los prismaticos te dejen ver planetas bien y nebulosas colores ect....no los volveria a comprar la verdad preferiria otros con zoom mas potentes y caros.
5,Topp-Produkt! Angesichts des aktuellen Preises von weit weit unter 100 Euro wird man wohl vergebens nach Alternativen suchen.Mein Exemplar jedenfalls bedufte keiner Nachjustierung was jedoch sicher auch vom HÃ¤ndler abhÃ¤ngig sein wird. Jedenfalls konnte ich nach dem Auspacken sofort loslegen und mich an der tadellosen QualitÃ¤t der Glases erfreuen.Einzig die (dÃ¼nne) Schutztasche wird dem Anspruch des qualitativ hochwertigen Glases nicht gerecht und Bedarf Ã¼ber lang oder kurz eines Austauschs.Im Anbetracht des Gesamtpreis-/LeistungsverhÃ¤ltnisses aber selbstverstÃ¤ndlich trotzdem volle 5 Sterne und ein extra dickes Lob an den Lieferanten ASTROSHOP/Nimax in Landsberg/Lech dessen engagiertes Personal offenbar mit viel Liebe zu seiner Arbeit und den von ihnen vertriebenen GlÃ¤sern dafÃ¼r gesorgt hat dass mich ein absolut einwandfreies Exemplar sehr sicher verpackt schnell erreicht hat!
4,I have no knowledge of astronomy but my husband was showing an interest and it was his birthday so I purchased these after reading the reviews here.We've been really pleased with them and have studied the moon jupiter and (possibly) its moons!  They are all very clear.The only thing I find trouble with is keeping them still as they're very heavy.  I often need to anchor my elbow somewhere in ordear to see properly.  Overall I'd recommend them.
5,Great pair of starting binoculars for astronomy for under Â£60 with big 70mm lenses that let in plenty of star light so you can explore the night sky.They are probably a bit big for most to hold steady for too long at a time so consider getting a tripod if you want to use them for longer peroids of time.Overall a big thumbs up from me.
5,sehr gute  Verarbeitung sehr gutes sehen die Optik ist sehr gut  ich mÃ¶chte auch sagen fÃ¼r den preis ein so gutesFernglas zu fertigen zeigt mir was mit den mitteln mÃ¶glich ist.man muss nicht hunderte von Euro ausgeben wenn man so ein tolles Glass bekommt  mit den teuren sieht man  auchnicht mehr.
4,Hallodrio...Warum wollte ich ein neues Fernglas?-Zur Sternenbeobachtung;speziell die Beobachtung der ISS (Internationale Raumstation)-Weil mein altes Weihnachtsgeschenk 10x50 Glas schielteLieferung TOP (amazon;Gesamtpreis 82â¬); 3-fach(sicher!) verpacktDurchblick bei Tag: Sehr Gut (Jagdglas); FÃ¼r lÃ¤ngere Beobachtunszeiten STATIV hilfreich(Adapter hierfÃ¼r wird mitgeliefert)!Nachtbeobachtung: (z.b:Orionnebel;Plejaden...)Begeisternder Eindruck des Nachthimmels!!! Bei helleren Einzelsternen erkennt man leichte QualitÃ¤tsunterschiede bei den Okularen.(Sterne erscheinen links und rechts im Hof nicht absolut identisch  - KEIN Zielachsenfehler(Kollimation)sondern anderer optischer Mangel)Ich wollte ja auch kein teueres Swarowski Glas;-)Kleinerer Mangel ist die beidseitige Okularbefestigung am Mittelstift(Scharfeinstellungsbereich) dort wackelt es minimal -bei behutsamen Umgang kein Problem.Abgesehen dieses kleinen Mangels und dem Umstend daÃ die Optik natÃ¼rlich nicht mit einem 500â¬ Glas mithalten kann ein ABSOLUT EMPFEHLENSWERSTES PRODUKT!Freue mich schon auf eine etwas wÃ¤rmere sternenklare FrÃ¼hlingsnacht !!!GrÃ¼Ãe an alle Hobby-ISS SchauerThomas
5,Economical astronomical binocular for deep sky objects. There is a tripod adapter in the box and it is a must to use a tripod. Shows clear and sharp views.
5,Seit 2 Monaten habe ich das Celestron Skymaster und konnte es inzwischen unter sÃ¼dlichem Himmel ausgiebig testen. Wunderbar: die ganzen Deep Sky Objekte in der sÃ¼dlichen Milchstrasse. Die bekannten Objekte wie Kugelsternhaufen M13 Andromdanebel groÃer Orionnebel sehr schÃ¶n. Auch die Jupitermonde. Beobachte sonst mit einem 20 cm Dobson-Spiegel der natÃ¼rlich mehr zeigt und man/frau darf natÃ¼rlich nicht die farbigen Hochglanzbilder des Himmels aus mehrstÃ¼ndigen Belichtungen vor Augen haben. Wichtig fÃ¼r lÃ¤ngere Beobachtung ist eine gute Halterung zum Aufschrauben auf ein solides Fotostativ. Die erste Verbindung aus Plastik war Marke "Wackeldackel". Im Freien bei leichtem Wind und kleinsten BerÃ¼hrungen tanzen die Sterne vor Augen. Das Ausschwingen dauert ewig zuvor kommt schon der nÃ¤chste WindstoÃ. Also: Unbedingt den stabilen Stativadapter aus Metall (z.B. Galaxster Ã¼ber Amazon)kaufen. Dann wird die Beobachtung zum VergnÃ¼gen.
5,Excellent piece of kit I managed to view the andromeda galaxy through these with ease compared to my old ones.
5,Very impressed with these binoculars; I was looking for a pair suitable for both field work and also astronomy. Seeing as  couldn't afford an expensive telescope I did a lot of research into binoculars as an alternative and found that these were a regular recommendation. I have been very impressed with them already as they are much lighter than I had imagined come with a nice carry bag and caps as well as a mount for a tripod. They have given me great views both in field and in the night sky so I am very glad I chose them!
4,I've used it to watch stars and was quite impressed. Although you have to keep in mind that with 15x magnification you will be only able to watch Moon and planets you will be also able to see most prominent consolations. One disadvantage though is that the glass is not resistant to high morning humidity which means that it will be all covered with dew and you won't be able to see anything.
5,Nachdem das erste Fernglas einen Sturz nicht Ã¼berlebt hat habe ich es nun wieder gekauft. Super Bild auch bei wenig Licht (DÃ¤mmerung). Auf 10-15 Meter ist die 15-fach VergrÃ¶Ãerung zur Tierbeobachtung super (Stativ ist zu empfehlen; Halterung fÃ¼r Stativ im Lieferumfang enthalten ). In den Bergen ebenfalls sehr gut nur bei Betrachtung des Mondes bei klarer Nacht kommt fast zu viel Licht durch.
5,Bought for amature star gazing and distant views.  I did manage to find Jupiter and three of its moons.  Fascinating to see the moons had moved on relation to each other and Jupiter the next night!  Just don't expect to see Saturn's rings galaxies or anything like that. Some star clusters are amazing though. Great if used with a monopod.  Overall excellent value.
5,I haven't yet used for looking at night sky due to clouds and time of year but give a very clear view of distant terrestial objects.
5,My partner loves these and so happy
5,Very good product for its price. I just got mine and i can only say WOW! Everything was perfect with it and the view with the right focus gives such a clear view. I can just recommend it to you!
4,It is a bit heavy good view
5,Ich habe ein Fernglas bekommen dass durch gute QualitÃ¤t besticht. Die Optik ist in Ordnung keine doppelten Bilder (wie hier schon Berichtet) das Glas lÃ¤sst sich angenehm bei der 15-fachen VergrÃ¶Ãerung noch einigermaÃen gut in der Hand halten. Ich benutze es zu Natur- und Flugbetrieb-Beobachtung. FarbrÃ¤nder konnte ich auch wahrnehmen aber bei dem Preis sicher hinnehmbar. Die Parameter lassen es auch als Nachtglas durchgehen.Bin damit zufrieden und wÃ¼rde es weiterempfehlen.
4,Magnificent Binos .. Pretty clear sharp image .. Quiet heavy 1.2 kgs ..need a stable hand to view object .. Have used for 2 sky shows until .. Perfect images of nebulae galaxies cluster were seen..on is splendid .. Was able to see moons of Jupiter and also the Saturn rings .. Thanks to the tripod adapter which fits into any standard tripod used for cameras ...
5,Celestron Sky Master 15Ã70 is Amazing Banacular quality is very nice great product great job well done Amazon & celestron & Seller corriere service is Amazing
5,Wirklich toll!An SchÃ¤rfe und Blickwinkel wesentlich besser als erwartet. FÃ¼r diesen Preis absolut gut. Wohne Ã¼ber einem Dorf mit sehr weiter Aussicht Ã¼ber die ganze Gemeinde. Mit diesem Glas kann ich ohne Probleme auch sehr weit entfernte Sachen gut sehen. Das Glas ist obwohl es recht groÃ ist sehr gut und ruhig zu halten. Wer natÃ¼rlich sehr lange etwas beobachten will sollte auf die StativmÃ¶glichkeit zurÃ¼ckgreifen. Besonders toll finde ich den recht breiten Blickwinkel bzw. Gesichtsfeld.
4,Good for beginnersFor space u need tripod
5,Good quality letâs in a lot of light
4,Es un producto vendido con advertencia de que estÃ¡ usado. EstÃ¡ en buenas condiciones funcionales y estÃ©ticas. Por ahora me parece una buena compra. Vino sin el adaptador para trÃ­pode pero Amazon ha solucionado ese defecto.
5,Mi opiniÃ³n prescindirÃ¡ de aspectos tÃ©cnicos porque no soy ningÃºn experto. Tan sÃ³lo dirÃ© que siempre quise unos prismÃ¡ticos "decentes" para observaciÃ³n diurna y nocturna ocasional (lluvias de estrellas paisajes naturales festivales aereos...). No querÃ­a gastar mucho dinero porque soy un simple aficionado ni querÃ­a tirar dinero (o arriesgar mi vista) con productos baratos y no fiables.Estos Celestron Skymaster son perfectos para el posible comprador que estÃ© en mi situaciÃ³n. Aumentos decentes materiales consistentes precio moderado. Recomendado usar trÃ­pode para los que quieran una observaciÃ³n cÃ³moda o no tengan buen pulso.Buscando por google encontrarÃ©is los pros y los contras tÃ©cnicos de este productopero espero que la opiniÃ³n sirva a los dudosos.
5,Not only great for star gazing but good for day time as well. Tripod is recommended.
3,Good for viewing moon. Not suitable for viewing other planets.
5,FÃ¼r den Preis ein super Fernglas verwende es ziemlich oft zur Mondbeobachtung aber auch beim Spazieren fÃ¼r Landschaft und Bergsicht.
5,These binoculars are made by Celestron so you know that they are made to a high standard and they certainly are. You literally triple the amount of stars you can see when you look through these the Moon looks incredible and you can clearly see the curvature of Venus and the four Galilean moons of Jupiter. However due to the large size of these binoculars you can't keep them steady for long so for extended stargazing you will need a tripod. Thankfully the binoculars come with a tripod adapter
5,Acabo de recibir los Skymaster 15x70 y he de decir que me han encantado vienen ya con un adaptador al trÃ­pode por lo que no es necesario comprar ningÃºn otro aunque es cierto que vibra bastante...Por lo demÃ¡s llevo toda la tarde noche pegado a ellos observando un cielo estupendo que tenemos hoy. De momento he visto las lunas de JÃºpiter AndrÃ³meda la nebulosa de oriÃ³n y un largo etcÃ©tera. Es increÃ­ble la cantidad de estrellas que pueden verse y eso que hay luna llena. La luminosidad es excelente incluso mejor con poca luz que con mucha y la aberraciÃ³n inapreciable. Los recomiendo totalmente. AdemÃ¡s el precio es imbatible.
4,Very nice Binoculars.Heavy and a steady hand is needed to star gaze. Best used with tripod or flat surface.You can see the moon in great detail but planets and stars just look like magnified bright lights. Not the products fault just my inflated expectations :P
1,Soy aficionado a la astronomÃ­a. He comprado tres unidades de este prismÃ¡tico Celestron (15x70) y he tenido que devolver las tres. Â¿Motivos? Nulo control de calidad tanto por Amazon como por Celestron. Unidades tan descolimadas que hasta un niÃ±o se darÃ­a cuenta; ruedas de enfoque con holguras inadmisibles; tubos Ã³pticos izdo y dcho con diferente campo de visiÃ³n... Incluso una unidad vendida como "nueva" con muestras evidentes de haber sido usada. Otra unidad vendida como "reacondicionado" y supuestamente comprobada tambiÃ©n mal. La devoluciÃ³n de mi Ãºltima unidad comprada ademÃ¡s problemÃ¡tica con Amazon teniendo que recurrir al servicio de atenciÃ³n al cliente. Simplemente encontrar ese nÃºmero de telÃ©fono es una aventura. Â¿Mis conclusiones? No vuelvo a intentarlo. Recomiendo comprarse unos Nikon Olympus o Pentax de 10x50 7x35 7x50 8x42 Ã³ 12x50 sistemas Porro o roof (en ese caso "Phase Coated")  segÃºn quieras mÃ¡s o menos campo tengas mejor o peor pulso tengas cielo mÃ¡s o menos oscuro y tu edad hagas tambiÃ©n observaciÃ³n de pÃ¡jaros (entonces que sean roof) o no y olvidarse del todo de Celestron para prismÃ¡ticos.
4,Good entry level astronomical bins. A bit more portable than a small telescope and a lot easier to use. You'd still need a good tripod to see anything of interest. Buy these before a telescope to learn your way around the night sky ... when it's not cloudy!
5,Possibly the best pair of binoculars to buy for optical quality and price great for astronomical viewing.
4,I purchase those binoculars in order to start my new hobby. The binoculars are good. I can observe the moon and few stars that you cannot see very well only with your eyes. The only minor is the way of construction. It gives you the feeling that it was rushed through production
4,Good for day and night time viewing.If using for astronomy make sure you have the right expectations first.Other reviews have said they are very heavy I personally don't find this to be the case. (I'm not the strongest person in the world lol) very good product lot's of fun to use and incredible viewing I'm still amazed when I use them during the day!
4,Bought these for bird watching and to view the moon and stars. They do the job well although are a bit heavy for me to hold manually. Hence I bought a large adaptor mount so they go onto my tripod.The binoculars come with a a nice carry bag which is very useful.
4,Good
4,Great product. Quite heavy but it thrills
5,Excellent clarity. . able to enjoy terrestrial objects. . moon was clear. .
5,Good for both day time and night time viewing. With celestial objects you will be able to see the moon in detail and see stars that you cannot see with the naked eye You are able to see objects that appear as a dot in the horizon in detail during day time. However a tripod is ideal. A good start to star gazing.
4,los comprÃ© cuando estaban a 60 euros y estoy contento con ellos. los primeros que me envÃ­o amazon estaban descolimados y tenian toda la pinta de haber sido devueltos por otra persona ya que parecÃ­an usados y estaba la rosca algo suelta. amazon me envio otros a los pocos dias y esta vez sÃ­ estaban perfectos. ideales para los principiantes que quieran observar el cielo identificar estrellas planetas y constelaciones. pesan bastante por lo que tiembla la imagen y se cansan los brazos. Ã©sto hace necesario el uso de un trÃ­pode.
4,Excellent binoculars BUT very delicate don't drop them or even knock them as the lenses will go out of line and they are broken for good! I knocked mine on a table just after I got them and they were useless with a double image. I sent them away to be re-aligned but they still aren't right.
5,No word on this wonderful binocular and this product is worth more than the money we give it. It must have a strong tripod for an unshaken look. A little trembling in the hand can greatly change the look.
4,Los he utilizado de forma casual para observar las estrellas y la naturaleza. A ese fin son perfectos amplian bastante y la imgen es muy nÃ­tida aunque debido a lo pesados y largos es difÃ­cil mantenerlos estables y uno se cansa rÃ¡pidamente de usarlos.
4,Me ha ustado buen producto para iniciarse en la astronomÃ­a o para su uso complementario con telescopios.  Los prismÃ¡ticos han cumplido las expectativas. El centro del ocular tiene una visiÃ³n nÃ­tida y los objetos de cielo profundo son visibles con Ã©l. TamabiÃ©n sirve para la luna para planetas no vale. La Ãºnica pega son pesados y requiren de trÃ­pode. No se si les puede caoplar algun tipo de adpatador para cÃ¡mara fotogrÃ¡fica
5,Having tried a telescope I find these are much more practical.
4,Vas a ver una barbaridad de estrellas sobre todo con un buen cielo. Puedes ver galaxias (AndrÃ³meda) y varios objetos messier cÃºmulos de estrellas y disfrutar en general del cielo muy bien. Lo malo es que pesan bastante pero es normal son unos pedazo de prismÃ¡ticos. MUY contento con ellos.
4,Very hard to adjust but no faults or missing parts it needs more technical professional handling. No damages it's alright. Good service and delivery thank you.
5,Works brilliantly with an old camera tripod.
4,Good quality image. To date they seem to be good binoculars for astronomical use not used as yet in the daytime as they are too heavy for general use loose a star as the tripod bracket is a little on the flimsy side.
5,Great product for star gazing and bird watching
4,These binoculars were recommended for stargazing (use a tripod) and I have seen Saturn and Jupiter.  The detail on the Moon is a revelation!I also use them for birdwatching in the garden but they are almost too powerful
4,These binos are great value for money. They are easy to focus and give a very clear view. You must use a tripod though and the adapter supplied is very flimsy - I recommend getting a sturdier adapter like the one Strathspey sell. Otherwise I would have given them 5 stars.
5,Bought this for my younger son who is 10. We happened to try it out on a night when apparently the moon was in a great position for seeing detail. And we certainly did. With the tripod we could see a lot of detail. We even look out over the city where we live in daylight. Good quality. Not a cheap toy. Need the tripod as it is too heavy and unstable to hold. That said a great buy.
5,Very useful product! You get clear and good images and seems like the farthest of objects birds and buildings alike have come under full access of your view. Full value for money. As usual very good service from our trusted site Amazon which hasn't disappointed us till now
1,When I started to use the binoculars I could see two images in two eye pieces. I ended up using it as a telescope observing images through one eye piece. I did some finding to realize that this is a problem with the collimation of the binocular and this happens when a purchase is made on line. The binocular should be replaced. Please buy such devices from brick and mortar stores and not on line.
4,Great view clear glasses. Weight is much but that is ok. Expected to see Moon more closer but failed It is not the mistake of the product. Need to go next level. Over all good one.
5,Haven't had much time with it at the moment but the very little time I spent after setting up the device I enjoyed every moment. Am not a pro on this issue but it excellent quality. A lot more can be said but no time to give further comment. I will recommend this to anyone that's all for now.
5,Nice  bright  image  ordered Tuesday came  Wednesday
5,Very powerfull lenceeasy to carryclear view
5,really good ..would recommend
5,I'm no expert but I am impressed with these binoculars crisp sharp but best to use a tripod for these the only negativepoint is the lense caps they dont stay on in fact quite loose to be honest they just fall off. But I still give them 5 stars. I would recommend these to anyone.Pro's -  Crisp sharp views and great at night for star gazing.Negative - Poor rubber lense caps they fall off.
5,These binocs are perfect for surveying the night sky in detail.  I have been able to look at Orion's nebula and Pleiades in wondrous detail.  The moon appears large in the binoculars with amazing detail and minimal aberration on image. Use with a tripod for the best viewing experience.  If you really want extensive detail consider a telescope but these are probably among the best practical (and affordable) binocs for the price.
4,Poor quality neck strap
5,Perfect
5,I purchased these to use for star gazing.They are without doubt the best value for money available.They are sharp and bright due to BAK 4  prisms.The come with carry case and a tripod mount which is not so good I got hold of a more suitable onethey are best suited for use with a tripod if you intend to spend any lengthy time sky watching.I can highly recommend these binocularsthey are superb value and quality..
5,Zugegebenerweise spekulierte ich auf ein tolleres und viel teureres Fernglas... wie das so ist MÃ¤nner.VernÃ¼nftigerweise griff ich jedoch zu diesem billigen Modell.. gottlob.Ich kann mit dieses Teil nÃ¤mlich alles sehen was ich wollte..Von meinem Wohnzimmerfenster erkenne ich alles an Mensch und Tier was sich zwischen unserem Hausund dem 15km entferntem Waldrand befindet... klar und deutlich.Das Fernglas liegt zudem gut in der Hand und macht einen wertigen Eindruck
5,Much better than my smaller ones. Quite heavy to hold.
3,Approximately what you'd expect for rather cheap optics. Stars look rather bright even in suburban areas and you'll be able to pick out even rather dim stars. But there is pretty awful chromatic distortion. For example while you can clearly see the moons of Jupiter as points of light the planet itself is a smear of orange and blue lobes that extend to about the diameter of the planet. Quite disappointing.
4,Good quality binoculars bought primarily for star gazing. The image quality seems great to me (as an amateur) and no complaints that I do recommend getting a tripod as they do start to weigh after a while.
1,Beim ersten Glas dachte ich noch kann ja mal passieren. Beim Zweiten naja noch ein MontagsgerÃ¤t erwischt. Aber beim Dritten genau dasselbe: Alle drei FernglÃ¤ser zeigen am Objektrand erhebliche FarbverfÃ¤lschungen ins Rote bzw. GrÃ¼ne bei hÃ¶herem Kontrast soll heiÃen wenn man z.B. einen Vogel auf einem Baum im Bild hat und der Hintergrund is wolkig. Da werden dann grÃ¼ne oder rote Federn vorgegaukelt. Oder man schaut sich den Mond an: Beim ersten Fernglas hatte dieser einen roten Rand beim zweiten war der Rand im oberen Bereich rot unten grÃ¼nebenso beim Dritten. Bei Sternen ist das nicht so aufgefallen keine Ahnung warum nicht.Und das ist jetzt kein Meckern auf hohem Niveau wenn sich vielleicht mancher denkt dass man nicht mehr fÃ¼r den Preis erwarten kann.Mein jetziges Fernglas ist ein Tele von Tchibo 10-30 x 50 fÃ¼r knapp 20 Euro (welches nach einem Sturz einen Knick in der Optik hat). Da konnte man manchmal einen Farbsaum erahnen aber diese farbigen "Balken" am Objektrand gab es nicht.Justierungsprobleme hatte ich bei keinem der drei aber die FarbsÃ¤ume sind ein ko-Kriterium. Deshalb nur 1 Stern.
5,Ich dachte fÃ¼r diesen Preis bekomme ich ein Buntglas.Aber es war nicht so! Selbst am Mond sehe ich keine FarbsÃ¤ume. Wunderbar!Die 15x kann man allerdings nicht mehr aus der Hand halten. Aber Stativmontierung ist dabei.Endlich Jupitermonde beobachten und Deepsky offene Sternenhaufen...Ich setze es ein um fÃ¼r ein 70-200 Objektiv Astrofotografie geeignete Sternengebiete zu suchen. DafÃ¼r finde ich es wunderbar...und wÃ¤hrend die Fotoaufnahmen laufen kann man mit dem Stativ wunderbar spechteln!
5,Todo genial
5,They're big and sturdy.  They give a great image.  I have a simple telescope and I prefer the image with these.  It does get quite shaky looking at nighttime objects in the sky but that's expected with binoculars.  Maybe I'll invest in a tripod one day.
4,It's too heavy. You can not use it in bear hands. This must be used in a tripod.
5,Great for viewing the moon and distant planets.
5,Delivered in 4 days. Perfect quality. Absolutely brilliant vision can see all the way across town from attic window and can see birds in the sky that I can't even with my eye. Not heavy at all can easily go on walks with the binoculars but wish I'd have bought a tripod because of course you can't keep your arms completely still! Can't wait for a clear night sky now!Definite must buy!
5,Good product. Great for beginners. Little on the heavier side though but works well on a tripod.
5,hab das Fernglas mittlerweile ein halbes Jahr und kann nur positives berichten:Mit dem Fernglas sieht man gestochen scharf. Hab noch ein altes Bausch und Lomb und ein altes Carl Zeis als Referenz rum liegen. Das Skymaster kommt ohne Frage an die BildqualitÃ¤t dieser alten FernglÃ¤ser und das fÃ¼r 70 Euro!!!!nur der Trageriemen kÃ¶nnte etwas massiver sein obwohl er hÃ¤ltbeachten sollte man nur dass das Glas zu schwer fÃ¼r den Einsatz beim Spaziergang ist. AuÃerdem ist es relativ unhandlich... aber das weis man vorherin Preis-Leistung nicht zu schlagen
5,Very pleased with these good views of the moon so far. Have them on a tripod as almost impossible to hand hold however experimenting at the moment with the technique for this as  it seems difficult when bins tilted to stand and get a good position to look through them will probably need to sit down can't kneel as bad knees.
4,Cheap and cheerful! For the money they work pretty well - but they do suffer from fringing when looking at astronomical objects. The supplied rubber tripod adaptor is a bit of a joke - get the Opticron L mount instead. But hey great for the money but now I'm looking for some serious glass...
4,Im Vergleich zu den anderen Teleskopen macht das Sehen mit 2 Augen deutlich mehr SpaÃ.Zumal der Mond ja groÃ genug ist. ;)
4,These are nice binoculars. However the magnification means that they are shaky when handheld. That is just a function of the magnification.The bad news is the supplied tripod adaptor is a joke. It flexes so much it's even less steady than handheld. So if you are buying this binoculars do order a proper metal adaptor alongside it.
4,Es imprescindible hacerse con un buen trÃ­pode u otro tipo de soporte para evitar vibraciones.Incorporan un adaptador para trÃ­pode pero es de plÃ¡stico y no evita el movimiento con una simple brisa.Se hace imprescindible adquirir aparte un adaptador metÃ¡lico y rÃ­gido.La distorsiÃ³n en los bordes se hace notar pero sin exageraciones y tambiÃ©n algo de cromatismo si observas objetos muy brillantes pero la relaciÃ³n calidad~precio es muy buena.Para iniciarse en astronomÃ­a o observaciÃ³n diurna son recomendables.
5,Sensational binoculars which are very powerful
4,It's a good product. But on the heavier side. You need to get used to the weight of the product. Otherwise quality of the product is very good.
5,I used on cruise on Norwegian fiords. Happy.
5,Love these binoculars. Easy to adjust & clear viewing. Quite heavy but that was expected.
4,Heavy
4,Picture quality not as good as I expected
5,Bonne jumelle mais il ne faut pas trembler !donc acheter un pied par la suite...........
4,Das Fernglas ist zwar gross aber nicht mal so schwer. Die Verarbeitung macht fÃ¼r den Preis einen guten Eindruck.Einzig die Kappen fÃ¼r die Objektive sind bloss aufgesteckt und fÃ¼r die Okulare eine gemeinsame Kappe die schlecht hÃ¤lt.FÃ¼r den Preis eine sehr positive Ãberraschung.
5,I've bought this for my 14 year old son and he just loved it!!
5,A very good optic indeed the vision is good and bright at all rangesit is very easy to use.It is a little heavyso the use of the enclosed tripod mount is a good idea. Overall the optic is good for the Long spotter and bird watcher and is well worth the rating and yes I would recomend it to others
5,Bei der Beurteilung von FernglÃ¤sern zeigt sich wÃ¤hrend der Himmelsbeobachtung wie es mit der QualitÃ¤t der Optik beschieden ist. Das Skymaster 15x70 Fernglas hat ein sehr gutes Preis-Leistungs-VerhÃ¤ltnis. Erfahrene Beobachter wissen dass ab 10-facher VergrÃ¶Ãerung eine gute Beobachtung nur mit Stativ oder Ã¤hnlicher StÃ¼tze mÃ¶glich ist. Deshalb liegt dem Fernklas auch ein entsprechender Adapter bei (leider aus Plastik und wenig stabil). Habe deshalb einen robusten stabilen Adapter separat gekauft.Die Verarbeitung ist gut bis auf ein leichtes Spiel bei der Fokussierung. FÃ¼r den Preis durchaus eine Kaufempfehlung.
4,good for the price i think. all the neighbours think i'm a peeping tom now though
4,Optically not perfect but excellent value for the price and well constructed. Plenty powerful enough for bird watching and stargazing e.t.c. Would recommend as a budget end purchase.
5,1. Unexpectedly High Light Gathering Capacity in this range (was able to see 10-25 times more objects than with naked eye) in light filled polluted sky of Pune2. Personal followup by seller3. Although Saturn Rings are not visible clearly; I was able to see elliptical outer shape of the planet when fixed on tripodMust have a tripod as it is not optically stabilizedOverall the BEST kit for entry level sky-watcherOne can expect optically stabilized space binoculars in days to come
4,bon produit pour premiÃ¨re expÃ©rience astro
4,Good product not had a chance to put through paces as it has been cloudy every night since purchase. Recommend tripod unless strong steady arms.
5,Very pleased with this as I have used others for sky gazing and can tell a good product.Do note as other say to get a tripod or lean against a wall or something as they will shake like hell.These as too heavy for a child to use without a tripod.
4,Don't rely on the strap. Totally unreliable.
5,For such a high power binocular they a pleasure to use with a huge field of view and remarkably steady when hand held. I use them for viewing shipping and fishing activities off shore hand held and usually semi supported on the car window.
4,Awesome product. Very useful for bird watching or watching objects upto 600 to 700m far very clearly. We can see moon very clearly with it.if u go out of city of lights....u can watch d sky in a much more impressive way.
4,Me ha sorprendido el campo de visiÃ³n  que es muy amplio. dejando al descubierto estrellas que no ves a simple vista incluso en la ciudad. Con un buen punto de apoyo se pueden observar perfectamente las bandas nubosas de jÃºpiter y sus lunas.Ay que tener en cuenta que su peso es mayor que unos prismÃ¡ticos normales.El accesorio para trÃ­pode que trae es algo a mejorar por la marca.
2,Ich habe mir dieses Fernglas eigentlich zum schnellen Spechteln gekauft und finde es von der Haptik und Optik her auch richtig gut bzw. meinen Erwartungen entsprechend. Jedoch hatte ich zwei GerÃ¤te welche unjustiert bei mir ankamen und damit eine doppelte Abbildung zeigen. Das Justieren geht leider nur wenn man festgeklebte Abdeckungen entfernen wÃ¼rde was fÃ¼r mich ein NoGo ist. Hier sollte Celestron dringend nachbessern. Wenn dieser QualitÃ¤tsmangel nicht schon ab Werk vorhanden ist dann sollte man sich eben den Transportweg anschauen. So ist es jedenfalls fÃ¼r mich unbenutzbar.
5,Wonderful piece received yesterday from USA with good packing. Very bright and clear view of stars and long distance objects. Does what it says. Tripod is a must to avoid shaking because it is around 1.5kgs. Definitely recommend for beginners. One can easily and clearly view objects till 2 kms.
5,Great binoculars although I can only compare them to some 10x50's that I've had for about 30 years. Not yet had chance to get them out at night though so can't yet comment on their use for astronomy (which is what I bought them for).
4,Quite bulky but excellently made. Not sure what else I can say really does what it says on the tin.
2,Good to start with but after a year of very light use the rubber around the viewing lense split.
5,Excellent Binoculars. Not too heavy to hold but I woudl suggest a tripod if you plan on holding them for more than a few minutes.The image quality is very good. I was able to clearly see Comet Lovejoy in Jan 2015 even though it was not visible to the naked eye
5,Top buy
5,Awesome product  Got a chance to view this august full moon amazing view. also got to view Saturn. Being in city with gibbous moon the view of saturn was nice. I was able to distinguish the rings. Also saw Jupiter Neptune Mercury Venus Mars. I have read other reviews and yes they were right. You will not have a telescopic look but for the beginners there is going to be a whole new sky. Go for it.
5,Value for money. It's a brilliant piece.
5,The neck strap is not very reliable looking for the weight of the binoculars I bought a new strap otherwise the binoculars are fantastic.
4,Great binocculars although as other reviews have stated they are quite heavy. But don't let this put you off.
4,Good
5,Das Preis/LeistungsverhÃ¤ltnis ist gut habe auch das 25x70 zum Vergleich bestellt dies war jedoch fÃ¼r meine Zwecke nicht passend jedoch auch sehr gut verarbeitet ideal wÃ¤re ein Zoom aber das Glas kann wirklich weiter empfohlen werden. Bin begeistert.
5,It's is very nice benecular it's range about 15km to20kmi like this product
5,Zum gebotenen Preis-/LeistungsverhÃ¤ltnis in Amazon Warehouse einfach unschlagbar!Einsatzgebiet: Freizeit UrlaubPro:- FÃ¼r den Preis super- Liegt fÃ¼r das Gewicht und GrÃ¶Ãe gut in der Hand- AussergewÃ¶hnlich lichstark in der DÃ¤mmerung und Nacht! (bei dem Preis!)- Lieferumfang mit Softtasche und OkularabschlÃ¼ssen- saubere VerarbeitungContra:- Stativaufnahmehalter leider aus Plastik und etwas wackelig- Verzeichnet etwas an den RÃ¤ndernFazit: Fernglas mit enormer Brennweite und sehr Lichtstark. Einen Vergleich zu teureren GlÃ¤sern kann ich hier nicht treffenfÃ¼r meinen Freizeitzweck aber genau das Richtige.
5,If you have an interest in star gazing these are excellent. I have seen 4 of the large moons of Jupiter with these.High mag is at the limit of what you can hold steady. Quite big and heavy but that will be the same for any 15 times 70 binoculars.
5,Also das Fernglas fasziniert mich immer wieder wegen seiner tollen Sichtweise. Nicht nur dass es Dinge aus der Ferne wunderbar scharf sichtbar macht auch das groÃe Sichtfeld und die DreidimensionalitÃ¤t. NatÃ¼rlich ist es etwas schwer aber mit einem Stativ geht es ganz einfach denn ohne wÃ¼rden einem die Details in der Ferne einfach verwackeln. Auch ist es ziemlich lichtstark im DÃ¤mmerlicht. Durch dieses "Ding" habe ich sprichwÃ¶rtlich meinen Horizont erweitert. Kurzum ich bin sehr zufrieden und empfehle es jederzeit auch wegen seines Preis-/LeistungsverhÃ¤ltnisses ohne Bedenken und gerne weiter.
5,Received these promptly today and all i can say is wow.The clarity and magnification of these is first class.They are lighter than i thought but a tripod is still essential.Anyone looking for a great pair of binoculars will be hard pressed to buy better than these.An absolute bargain.
4,Esta bien para todo tipo de observaciones es difÃ­cil mantener la imagen a pulso se necesita un apoyo. La luna se aprecia con mÃ¡s detalle lÃ³gicamente pero no es un telescopio quizÃ¡s sea mÃ¡s prÃ¡ctico un monocular de las mismas caracterÃ­sticas o mirar sÃ³lo por uno.Buena relaciÃ³n calidad-precio.
1,Optik verspannt (dreieckige Sterne ) und dejustiert (Doppelbilder) so prÃ¤sentierte sich das Glas.  Der beiliegende Stativadapter ist ein Witz und schwabelt vor sich hin. Neuschrott der den hochtrabenden Namen "Skymaster" nicht ansatzweise verdient.Ich hab von meinem RÃ¼ckgaberecht Gebrauch gemacht.
4,Nice binoculars great zoom tripod must..great binoculars at this price tag..thnx amazone...little heavy tripod must for this skymaster...better than other product at this price ..
5,Think these are great for the price. Rather heavy as others have said and need a tripod. Got a Hama Star 63 for about Â£18 which does the job well. When I first opened box thought the tripod mount looked OK but it isn't ! get a metal one.Now enjoying great views of the moon and stars.
5,Its fulfill my requirements in me garden
4,observation du ciel et des paysages
4,Ein leicht zu bedienendes Fernglas.Man sieht den Mond und andere Naturereignisse wirklich sehr gut damit.KÃ¶nnte nur etwas stabiler sein.
4,Leyendo los comentarios tuve mis dudas pero la realidad es que la relaciÃ³n calidad/precio es excelente disfruto de buenas vistas desde mi terraza y con el Sky Master aÃºn mÃ¡s.
1,Sin duda decepcionado es poco es intolerable que un producto de tales prestaciones sufra un casi nulo control de calidad por parte de la marca.El primer dÃ­a que los probÃ© todo correcto muy entusiasmado y contento de poder disfrutar de sus excelentes aumentos y profundidad la verdad que este aspecto es indudable y es una delicia a pesar de su peso con un buen trÃ­pode su experiencia es formidable y muy recomendable.Lo que es intolerable es que tan solo un par de dÃ­as despuÃ©s de su compra y solo haciendo uso en casa comienzo a ver la visiÃ³n borrosa se empaÃ±a el ocular derecho y ademÃ¡s un mareo y ganas de vomitar BESTIAL debido a su descolominaciÃ³n de la noche a la maÃ±ana solo un par de dias despuÃ©s de su compra.Menos mal que como siempre AMAZON de 10 con las devoluciones y responsabilizÃ¡ndose de tal problema.Os sugiero plantear mucho su compra a noser que tengÃ¡is los conocimientos suficientes para colimarlos vosotros mismos (con la correspondiente perdida de garantÃ­a) o en su defecto estarÃ¡s siempre pendiente que algÃºn dia tarde o temprano tendrÃ©is un problema de este tipo inadmisible.
5,Most impressed with these binoculars. Have mounted them on a very sturdy mount in my observatory and have been using them regularly. I would recommend them for astronomers who want a wider field of view than scopes. They are bright and clear and do everything I wanted them to do. Essntial that they are securely mounted though. Very good price from Amazon.
5,Little heavy compare to other binoculars
5,Wegen Empfehlungen im Internet habe ich mir fÃ¼r Hobby-Astronomie dieses Fernglas statt einem Teleskop bestellt. Es liegt sehr gut in der Hand und ermÃ¶glicht einen sehr klaren Blick auf den Sternenhimmel. Die Galileische Monde von Jupiter sind leicht sichtbar. FÃ¼r Tagesobservationen ist es auch perfekt geeignet. FÃ¼r ~80â¬ kann man fast nichts Besseres kaufen.
4,Replaced my telescope with this. Way easier to handle and no setup!
4,Bonjour bonne jumelle mais sur etoile ou planete câest double il parait que câest recurent
4,bin zufrieden
5,It's a great beginner binocular for astronomy one can enjoy Orion nebulae Vega Andromeda and other easy targets.
5,Having tried all celestron sizes these are best all round for general and sky gazing.Dont expect too much but i for one am happy.can hold for short time but get optitron tripod adapter and throw celestron one away lol.Come well packaged and with a bag too.shame strap is nrrow but buy these youll be happy with them.
5,These were bought as a gift for my wife. Great price great quality and very easy to use when she can't be bothered to drag her telescope outside. The tripod mount is a little flakey and we'll probably replace it but at this price I can't really quibble.
5,These binoculars are simply awesome. Got 4 pairs of quality bins some over twice the price and these are by far the best for astronomy. Great for terrestrial viewing also. Not too heavy and really great views of the night sky. For this money it's a no brainer!
5,Utiliser pour l'astronomie. Elles sont de bonne qualitÃ©.trÃ¨s content de cet achat. Pratique pour les porteurs de lunettes. Fixation pour trÃ©pied fournie. C'est Ã  mon avis la taille maximale pour les emmener en vacances. J'avais hÃ©sitÃ© avec des 20Ã80 et je ne regrette pas mon choix
5,Nice pair of binoculars. Easy to use and great comes with tripod stand. Good images and a good way to start looking at the stars.
5,Es war ein Geschenk und hÃ¤lt was es verspricht.
4,Good for bird watching long distance views and watching ð moon only. Use a tripod for stable and long duration watching.
5,Very clear lets in loads of light
5,Costly
5,Los prismaticos me han llegado una semana antes de lo previsto; el producto genial pues estoy empezando en el mundo de la astronomÃ­a.
2,Despite positive reviews on various websites these binoculars suffer from chromatic aberration and are difficult to hold steady for more than a few seconds. They do allow a lot of light to enter the lens so you can see plenty of the night sky but again the movement renders them useless for stargazing (their selling point) in my opinion without a tripod. And if you need a tripod why not just get a telescope?Even recommending them as a daytime pair of binoculars on a tripod mount is difficult as they do suffer from the aforementioned chromatic aberration. I have a small pair of roof prism binoculars by Bushnell (10x25) that work perfectly and I'll probably go back to using these even though the range is less. Disappointing.
5,It is not suitable for sky viewing purpose it (celestron 15*70) doesn't have any zoom liver so you can't zoom any thingit may be usefull for wild life viewing but it is too heavy for that purpose in my case amazon policy doesn't allow to return open packages so my celestron 15*70 is increasing beauty of my store room.I suggest you people to check details befor buying.
5,Fantastic!  Can see so much with these without having to get the telescope out.They will make your shoulders ache with prolonged use with their weight but worth it. Best use with a tripod.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                Â Nice product very easy to use first two images are 1.5 km far very clearly visible
5,These were bought to see the stars and haven't been a disappointment. Who knew there was so much to see up there even in a light polluted West Yorkshire town. They even come with a tripod adapter. Excellent value for money!
4,But you need a really sturdy tripod that goes up quite high so you can angle the thing down to look up at the sky or hold them on an upturned broom if you are a cheapskate!
5,Sturdy well made excellent quality for the money. Centre image is crisp and clear. Slightly heavier than normal but feels well in your hands. Slightly shaky with distant views but quality over compensates this.
5,Ein fÃ¼r diesen Preis recht gutes Glas.Das erste Glas was geliefert wurde hatte sporadisch Doppelbilder. Nach verÃ¤nderung der Einstellung war das teilweise behoben aber wurde das Glas abgesetzt machten die Augen Probleme und es wurde einem leicht schwindelig.Ich habe das Glas reklamiert und Ersatz bekommen. (wie immer bei Amazon schnell und Problemlos)Das neue Glas ausgepacktgetestet und alles super. Zwar ist das Bild nicht so scharf wie bei einem Steiner-Glas ist ja aber auch eine andere Preisklasse.  Ich wÃ¼rde das Fernglas wieder kaufen.
5,Pour le prix  excellent jumelle trÃ¨s bien faite et trÃ¨s bonne dÃ©finition trÃ¨s lumineuse (diamÃ¨tre de 70 mm) peut Ãªtre aussi utilisÃ©e pour observer la nature Ã  condition d'Ãªtre assis car vu le grandissement fois15 attention au bougÃ©. Bien entendu elle a un peu de chromatisme pour lâobservation lointaine comme l'observation en astronomie.ReÃ§u rapidement en moins de 7 jours et sans casse car le colis Ã©tait trÃ¨s bien emballÃ©.
1,DevolvÃ­ los primeros no se veÃ­a nada bien y los segundos se ha roto el tornillo del enfoque y no tiene arreglo.Una porquerÃ­a!!
5,ich bin zwar laie und kann daher nicht groÃartig etwas dazu schreiben aber soweit ich es beurteilen kann bin ich zufrieden. gute qualitÃ¤t scharf stellen ohne anleitung kein problem. freihÃ¤ndig kurz benutzbar da es doch stark vergrÃ¶Ãert. also fÃ¼r lÃ¤ngere beobachtungen wÃ¼rde ich ein stativ empfehlen . ich habe das "alpha 2800" dazu bestellt und bin zufrieden. adapter fÃ¼r stativ ist beim fernglas schon dabei
5,Not light but great range and clear
4,Great product. Very solid. Plastic tripod mount supplied is not up to the standard of the binocular. These are really too heavy to hand hold but very impressive on a tripod for stargazing.
4,Son Ãºtiles y fÃ¡ciles de enfocar. Se ve la luna por ejemplo con gran detalle. Eso si pesan y aunque se pueden manejar sin trÃ­pode bien es verdad que para estar observando por tiempos prolongados lo mÃ¡s adecuado serÃ­a usar un trÃ­pode.Las estrellas se ven muy bien.
5,have used these now for over three years they are a reliable pair of binoculars taken out in all weathers including boat trips in rain and hail highly recommended.
5,Very powerful heavy but clear vision lenses.Nice one
5,Great binoculars for stargazing in particular when the sky is moving too fast to allow time for a telescope viewing outdoors. i.e. fast-moving cloud-cover in patches. Jupiter is clearly visible along with several  of its moons ...Crips clear images and a wide field of view ...
5,Fab
5,Received in good condition.
3,Powerful but seems like eye cups when put on some body was a little careless with what looks like black glue recommend check soon as.i bought for father and he never mentioned too late now i suppose shame from a good company
4,For the price this is a fantastic product of good quality. The only let down is the relatively poor stand bracket that comes with it. The binos itself is fantastic really clear and of sturdy build.
2,Certainly not for skywatcher planets visualisation very poor for Jupiter and Saturn. Visualisation distorted if zoomed.
5,Really good for looking at the moon
4,Good value for money!
5,En principio pensaba limitar el uso de los prismÃ¡ticos a observaciÃ³n astronÃ³mica pero sirven igual de bien para uso "normal" que otras marcas consagradas y mucho mÃ¡s caras.El peso y los aumentos estÃ¡n en el lÃ­mite de poder sostenerse sin ayuda de trÃ­pode. Los utilizo ocasionalmente con un trÃ­pode Manfrotto MKC3-H01 y es una gozada manejarlos.La Ãºnica pega es el adaptador que viene incluido para adaptarlos al trÃ­pode. Todo lo demÃ¡s perfecto.
4,It is a nice binocular for amateurs like me but biggest con that I have is that it doesn't have a zoom lever.You might need a tripod as without it it would be unstable to see sky.
5,Lovely piece of kit
4,Unos prismÃ¡ticos que te harÃ¡n pasar al nivel siguiente por lo que es la observaciÃ³n astronÃ³mica. Se perciben objetos tenues hasta en la ciudad (nebulosas cÃºmulos abiertos) . Imprescindible un trÃ­pode para un confort en la sesiÃ³n de observaciÃ³n. El acabado estÃ¡ echo con esmero y la LUMINOSIDAD es impresionante cuando estabas acostumbrado a prismÃ¡ticos clÃ¡sicos. Un "must".
5,Easy to use for stargazing
4,Easy to setup but better to get a good tripod holder.
5,Se ve de lujo!! Una pasada.Los mejores que he tenido ni werlisa ni olimpus este es el que mas me gusta.
5,TrÃ¨s bon Ã©quipement pour observer le ciel
3,Meh not as good as people say it is collimation was also a bit out on mine
5,Gutes Fernglas. Besonders im Abstand bis zu 500m lassen sich Details noch deutlich erkennen. Auch der Mond lÃ¤sst sich hiermit ersatzweise zum Teleskop schÃ¶n betrachten. FÃ¼r diese Preisklasse bin ich mit dem Fernglas absolut zufrieden.Es empfiehlt sich jedoch das Fernglas auf ein Stativ zu montieren da das Ruhighalten aufgrund der GrÃ¶Ãe und des Gewichts recht schwierig ist.
1,Really disappointed as I'd read really good reviews as well as the other reviews here that advised poor build quality and collimating problems. I'm an optimist and purchased on balance for the good reviews - I made a mistake! The cap for the ocular bells is a single cap that bridges both and does not fit snugly at all. The hinge arrangement between the two sides does not move very smoothly and when it does it makes a faint grinding sound. The ocular bells appear to float slightly too. The collimation/alignment is out and while the images through each eye piece individually looked quite crisp when viewed through simultaneously the image is duplicated/ghosting and will not resolve. The tripod adaptor was not in the box either. Not at all the bargain that I thought I was getting - I've made arrangements for immediate return.
5,First time binoculas and I have made the right choice. Very good quality and good vision. Thank you
5,Well worth buying as the view through these is crystal clear. I can see four of Jupiter's moons etc.Daylight viewing is excellent for viewing birds or aeroplanes
4,Para alguien con gafas como yo pueden ser un problema por la falta de regulaciÃ³n. Necesitan trÃ­pode pero viene con el acople de rosca a un cuarto y con una funda para guardarlo todo. Buena compra.
5,It is the best product for beginners to watch the night sky.
5,Bought the Binoculars as a birthday gift. They were delivered within 4 days and were well packaged. The recipient loved his gift the only downside was they are quite heavy so for long viewing periods you would need a tripod. Maybe this could be his next gift.
5,Hace un mes que lo compramos y lo estamos disfrutando un montÃ³n.
4,En realidad lo he comprado para regalarlo a un sobrino de 10 aÃ±os. Se estÃ¡ interesando en las constelaciones y me pareciÃ³ estÃ¡ la mejor forma de motivarlo.Lo he probado con Ã©l y la verdad que sorprende mucho me dejÃ³ alucinado. Eso sÃ­ es necesario estabilizarlo con trÃ­pode.TOTALMENTE RECOMENDADO.
5,Perfect for purpose
5,Me gusta por la movilidad que tiene a la hora de hacer astrofotografia.
5,V good so far (had them for a couple of months). Not used them outside as they feel a bit delicate. Only paid about Â£60 so for that money they are a good value buy.
5,Einziger Minuspunkt das erste Glas wurde nicht entsprechend sorgfÃ¤ltig verpackt und muÃte umgestauscht werden da dejustiert.Beim neuen Glas war die Verpackung angemessen und ja ich bin begeistert. Das Glas ist fÃ¼r seine GrÃ¶Ãe erstaunlich leicht und angenehm zu halten und an der AbbildungsqualitÃ¤t gibts nichts zu bemÃ¤ngeln. Daher kann ich diese Glas ohne Bedenken weiterempfehlen und das nicht nur weil der Preis unschlagbar ist.
5,These are amazing really are. I can't imagine what you can see using the more expensive ones but these ones are well worth the money. Just don't cheap on a tripod as I did and that's a pain. So go for a good sturdy tripod.
4,This is an awesome binocular if you are starting with star gazing. Though it is quite heavy and very difficult to get stable view without a tripod. But you will definitely fall in love with it once you buy it!!
5,Muy buenos prismÃ¡ticos
5,Really good product excellent magnification.  they are a bit heavy and a bit on the long side but they work well.
4,A good buy at the budget end of the binocular range.These binoculars have a high magnification but need to be mounted on a tripod.
3,Great however one lens seems difficult to focus and if not using a tripod impossible to keep steady!! Great for first time users
5,Sehr guter Artikel um ein bisschen in die Sterne zu gucken. Den Orionnebel kann man sehen. Das Preis/LeistungsverhÃ¤ltnis stimmt hier!
4,Bought as a present for my Dad they have been used for looking at the sky at night. They are quite heavy so we gave him a tripod as well.
2,Came with a focus wheel not working and an eyepiece that detached - lokos like a manufacturing fault. So now Im trying to return via amazon accidentally picked a return option I didnt want because it isnt clear how they work ath the point you sleect the options. So now trying to work out how to undo the collect i dont want and re-select the one I do want.
5,holt enorm ran. Tolle Leistung. Sehr zufrieden.
5,FÃ¼r Leute die nicht viel Geld ausgeben wollen aber trotzdem ein Lichtstarkes Fernglas nutzen mÃ¶chten genau der richtige einstieg. Die Farbfehler sind bei diesem Glas sehr gut korrigierthÃ¤tte ich bei dem Preis nicht erwartet.Man sollte sich nur noch einen vernÃ¼nftig stabilen StativanschluÃ mit bestellender mitgelieferte ist einfach nicht verwindungssteif genug und es wackelt doch sehr.
5,Ace Easy to adjust not too heavy superb images... Lay on your back on a sun lounger with these bad boy's balanced on the brows you wont be disappointed.
1,no matter what I didI cleaned itI adjusted the zoomI spent 79 pounds on itstill it does not workI live in a world of scammers and bottom feeders and god
4,A little heavy but is a good product
5,Das beste Glas zum unschlagbaren Preisich habe sehr lange im Fachhandel gesucht aber dieses Glas top einfach mal alles zu diesem Preis. Die VergrÃ¶Ãerung ist der Wahnsinn und unheimlich klar  sehr zu empfehlen. Stativ dazu kann ich auch nur empfehlen.
1,ArrivÃ©e cassÃ©e au niveau des bagues de maintien des oculaire. Colis PrivÃ© : livreur Ã  fuir en zone rurale ils ne va pas aux maisons Ã©loignÃ©es du centre-ville!.Les protections d'optiques ne tiennent mÃªme pas .Et certainement pas le grossissement annoncÃ© pas mieux que mes 10x50.Renvoi et remboursement .
5,Excellent pair of binoculars. Andromeda can be seen in a clear night sky. Moon looks fabulous. Handy product for a budding stargazer.
3,Los comprÃ© para observar el cielo nocturno y sin hacerles nada se descolimaron solos. Si a esto le unimos que necesitan un trÃ­pode para ver bien las cosas no me compensa. Los devolvÃ­ y comprÃ© otros de menos aumentos y mÃ¡s robustos. Si bien teniendo trÃ­pode y la suerte de que no se descolimen van bien. Buena calidad y dentro del rango de zoom son los mÃ¡s baratos que encontrÃ©.
5,Excellent product
4,just a tad heavy but very good
5,LOVE these! Took them on safari and they were excellent. Also good for star spotting.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                Â My first Binocular......excellent for terrestial viewing.....yet to use it properly for star gazing.......Tripod is a must........one can also shoot pics using a mobile from the eyepiece of binos....I love it.
4,He comprado este producto por indicaciÃ³n de una asociaciÃ³n de astronomia por su calidad y buen precio.  Me alegro de haberles echo caso.  Me gusta sus prestaciones y aunque necesita un tripode es bastante cÃ³modo.  Lo recomiendo.
5,I bought a personal binocular for sky viewing......and very satisfied for timely delivery and good viewing
4,resonable 15X70 poro prism binoculars.good FOV.good companion to my telescope.i always use it on the night sky.gives a decent image and FOV.a little blur on the sides but that's fine for me.i recommend.good quality for the price!
3,Dieses Fernglas bietet mit seinen Werten eine bemerkenswerte VergrÃ¶Ãerung zu einem reellen Preis. Es ist mir aber nicht gelungen im Vergleich mit vier anderen FernglÃ¤sern eine saubere BildschÃ¤rfe herzustellen. Mit einem schwÃ¤cheren Fernglas konnte man eine weit entfernte Beschriftung besser lesen als mit diesem Fernglas.
5,A bit tricky to hand hold but boy do they zoom! Neighbours have no idea!
3,No soy ningÃºn experto en astronomÃ­a pero sÃ­ sÃ© de fotografÃ­a y con estos prismÃ¡ticos he aprendido que ocurre lo mismo que con los objetivos: cuanto mÃ¡s baratos peor. Estos prismÃ¡ticos estÃ¡n bien para hacer observaciÃ³n de iniciaciÃ³n pero en cuanto los comparas con un buen objetivo o unos prismÃ¡ticos mÃ¡s caros se nota que la calidad de imagen no es la mejor. Tienen algo de aberraciÃ³n cromÃ¡tica. AdemÃ¡s el adaptador de trÃ­pode es de plÃ¡stico por lo que es inservible dado el aumento y el peso de los prismÃ¡ticos.
4,Perfectos para observaciÃ³n espacial e incluso mirar la luna en detalle sin embargo le falta aumentos y precision para disfrutar del cielo de noche o quizÃ¡s a mi mÃ¡s tÃ©cnica pero por 50â¬ no se puede pedir mucho mas...
2,The quality is surprisingly not that great. The zoom is just OK viewing quality is also just fine but it is not at all suitable for night viewing.
5,A pair of 70 mm binoculars for my star gazing hobby was recommended to me and I am so glad that bought these. The optics are first class and the focus crisp. I would definitely recommend. Good for all activities.
3,apres 1 renvoi pour defaut de parallaxe la seconde est correcte
5,Tested Binoculars on Jupiter all 4 moons were clearly visible. Impressed so far.
4,+ : Sin duda su luminosidad y la amplitud del diametro de su lente.- : A veces el enfoque no es tan preciso como gustarÃ­a (no obstante se comporta de una manera mÃ¡s que correcta en general). Su peso es recomendable un trÃ­pode.
5,I have a 4 1/2 " Newtonian reflector and these binos supplement it beautifully. The optics are fantastic for the price and they are very light and easy to handle. I have subsequently bought two other pairs as gifts.
4,TrÃ¨s bien pour observer le ciel mais aussi la nature le trÃ©pied est obligatoire pour la stabilitÃ© sinon maux de tÃªte et vomissements assurÃ©s.
5,Only just received these binoculars and they're better than what I expected.  Purchased them in the lightning deal for around Â£40 well worth the money.
4,Aunque para los aumentos que tiene se recomienda el usa de un tripode resultan muy manejables y con un poco de prÃ¡ctica se pueden usar sin estos.Muy recomendable para astronomÃ­a  y para naturaleza el Ãºnico  inconveniente es su tamaÃ±o.
5,Celestron 71009 15x70 Skymaster Binocular Excellent for both celestial and terrestrial. Simply great to view the Moon.
5,Lo que no me ha gustado es que aconsejen comprar aparte el adaptador para trÃ­pode... cuando ya viene incluido con los prismÃ¡ticos...No me fijÃ© lo pedÃ­ y me encontrÃ© con un elemento repetido... y pagado...DebÃ­an cuidar los asesoramientos y consejos a la hora de la compra y que su fin no fuera exclusivamente vender mÃ¡s... puede salir perjudicada la imagen de la compaÃ±ia...
5,I liked its quality of sharpness and it is very reasonable compared with price and quality...
5,El producto muy bien se ve genial y es de buen material contento con la compra al precio que lo pille pero necesitas trÃ­pode y bueno si quieres ver algo.
5,As described
5,My dad's overjoyed with these. He can spend nights staring at the stars from wherever he wishes. Come in a carry case too so no grandkids' sticky fingers can get to the lenses. Thank you.
5,Para ser mis primeros prismaticos astronomicos sÃ³n una pasada pesan un poquitin para mantener el pulso firme pero con un tripode normalito la  imagen se estabiliza llevo con el un mes y cuando el tiempo y las nubes me dejan observo la luna (impresionante para ver sus crateres sombrasreflexion...)  con una aplicacion de mapa estelar o con un buena guia del cielo es facil orientarse.
4,A bit heavy to keep still but happy with purchase.
1,No clarity in long range
3,Ziemlich schwer eigentlich fÃ¼r mich nur mit Stativ zu nutzen. Beim anschrauben an das Stativ ist mir leider ein Plastikteil abgebrochen und das Fernglas sitzt nun ziemlich wacklig.

1,Looked good value for money but when they arrived the collimation was way off. Whatever interpupilary distance there was a double image. Returned to Amazon and fair play to their customer service a replacement arrived the next day. However this one was almost as bad and totally unusable. You can adjust the collimation but only by ripping the plastic grips off!! Have returned for a refund.
5,It's working very well I can see much more from this Binocular than my unaided eyes. Moon also looks very interesting and clear with this and I can see much more than I had expected from this product.
3,Al sacarlo por primera vez detectÃ© marcas tanto el el cuerpo como en la rueda de enfoque. Las lentes parecen limpias y el producto parece funcionar correctamente la imagen se ve limpia. Lo probarÃ© unos dÃ­as mÃ¡s a ver quÃ© tal. De todas formas he quedado algo decepcionado ya que el producto parece haber sido usado. Respecto al envÃ­o llegÃ³ antes de lo previsto.
5,Can clearly see the craters on the moon
5,Decent pair of binoculars for the money they are very heavy though so best used with a tripod unless you're only using them for short periods.
5,Boyfriend loves them
5,Before buying these I made the mistake of opting for a cheaper pair and what a mistake that was. These are a fantastic pair of binoculars and well worth the money.
5,AquÃ­ y pese a quien pese podemos decir que estamos encantados con ellos  quizÃ¡ el Ãºnico inconveniente por llamarlo de algÃºn modo serÃ­a el tamaÃ±o  pero su poco peso lo compensa  tienen buena luz se manejan bien  enfocan a gran distancia con nitidez y encima si se golpean accidentalmente prÃ¡cticamente no sufren  Ã©sta es otra buena compra .
5,Awsome binoculars for everyone..need to ensure stability for better viewing experience.
4,En cuanto a calidad precio estÃ¡ muy bien. No es un equipo profesional y para iniciarte en la observaciÃ³n estelar es bueno. Solo usar con trÃ­pode.
5,Fantastic once I learnt to focus them.  Can see Jupiter and several of her moons.
4,These binoculars have a high magnification but need to be mounted on a tripod. They will be  an asset to our astronomy club equipment.
4,Buena visibilidad nÃ­tidos y robustos con el acople para el trÃ­pode.  tapones para las lentes buenos y bolsa de trasporte fuerte y un poco acolchada por dentro.
4,Estube mirando en muchos sitios y el mejor precio lo encontre aqui. sin sorpresas ... ya que el producto lo habia probado con anterioridad. todo de goma y muy resistente... el unico inconveniente es que peso mucho pero su alcance es fantastico.
4,from what i was told these are really good and impressive :)
5,I've only just got into astronomy and was recommended these great value well made. Very clear not too heavy and great on a tripod. Very pleased with my purchase.
5,As by "The Sky at Night".  They are perfect for astronomy.  Difficult to get used to holding them still but you get there in the end.  Tripod recommended as well.  I love them.
4,Ich bin sogar angenehm Ã¼berrascht Ã¼ber die QualitÃ¤t.Ein Fernglas mit solcher einer VergrÃ¶Ãerung hatte ich bislang noch ncht ich bin damit zufrieden.
5,Dieses Glas ist sehr Lichtstark die Objekte sind klar und sehr deutlich zu erkennen. durch das etwas hÃ¶here Gewicht wackelt man auch nicht so.Tipp: halten Sie das Glas ganz am Ende fest dann ist es noch ruhiger.
5,Tolles GerÃ¤t zur Mond- und Sternenbeobachtung und alles andere entfernte. GÃ¼nster Preis. AUch in der DÃ¤mmerung ausreichend helles Bild gerade noch so mit der Hand zu halten besser natÃ¼rlich wenn man sich abstÃ¼tzt. Auch gut fÃ¼r mich als BrillentrÃ¤ger.
5,Amazing bit of kit. Really pleased and great price
4,Es lo que esperaba conocÃ­a el producto.solamente tiene un problema de coordinaciÃ³n con la visiÃ³n binocular pero es lÃ³gico cuando se superan los 15 aumentos.
2,Great specs for the price. It seemed too good to be true. And it is. Good lenses and it may do the job but unfortunately very poor construction with equally poor materials. Reading the online reviews you understand that it is a risky buy as many of them come with collimation problems or other kind of problems. I took the risk and unfortunately lost the bet as one of the lenses came completely loose. Even if you get lucky and get a good condition one you'll always have to buy a tripod adaptor as the one provided is completely worthless.
5,So good for birdwatching and stargazing although a tripod is definitely advisable!
5,Delighted with item. Perfect for looking out to sea watch ships cruise ships and view the stars.
3,no issue about product quality.. there was litle confusion regarding delivery of the product
5,Just love these!  They make celestial bodies look like you could just reach out and touch them!  Really good value for money
4,Good product
5,Superb piece of kit  far exceeded expectations . The detail on the moon is rather mind-blowing !
5,This is superb product for normal viewer better to order with tripod stand as it is too heavy that you cant view for long time holding itit's the best i have seen till date . Thanks to amazon as it has delivered before the promised date
5,Love them and very impressed with the quality of the view you get not just the wildlife but also the stars definatly need a tripod for these as they are bit heavy
5,HolaLa relacion precio calidad es de lo mejor que he visto en mis 40 aÃ±azos de pasion astronomica para diurno tambien va muy bien veo aves muy aceptablemente copas oculares algo incomodas sin molestar del todo peso contenido y calidad de imagen buena....He visto nebulodad oscuras( por ejemplo la "E" de Barnard en Aquila) muy muy biem.Lo recomiendo.
4,Well constructed and great value.. the only downside is that they are heavy and really need a small tripod if yourequire prolonged viewing of a single object
1,Ich besitze eine Celestron Evolution 8 HD Teleskop und bin damit zufrieden. Aber dieses Fernglas ist fern von der QualitÃ¤t die ich beim Teleskop erfahren habe. Es ist einfach nicht mÃ¶glich die GlÃ¤ser einzustellen. StÃ¤ndig hat man ein doppeltes Bild! Ich kann dieses in den vielen anderen Rezensionen hier geschriebenes nur bestÃ¤tigen. Das Fernglas ist somit Nutzlos und ging zurÃ¼ck.
4,well pleased with product arrived so promptly will deffo buy again
5,Awesome pair of bins ...quite heavy after long periods of use get a tripod for stargazing as you will have dancing stars in your vision.
4,Gives first class resolution allows in a good degree of light and magnification is all that is asked for. Recommended.
4,Buena luminosidad vision nitida y como era de esperar algo pesados pero en general estoy muy satisfecho con la compra.
5,Tolles Glas zu einem tollen Preis. Gerade fÃ¼r Ausblicke auf den Mond oder in den Sternenhimmel zu empfehlen.Allerdings durch die AuflÃ¶sung und das Gewicht des Glases nicht ganz einfach zu handhaben. Bessere Ergebnisse erzielt man durch auflegen der Arme auf einem Tisch oder durch Montage auf einem Stativ.Bei Tag ebenfalls sehr gute Bilder und tolle AuflÃ¶sung.
1,Very bad quality not value for money
5,Geniales sin problemas de enfoque   claridad de imagen tampoco esperen el aumento  de un telescopio pero por ejemplo  ves JÃºpiter y sus lunas...alucinante...donde ves una estrella a simple  vista con los prismÃ¡ticos  ves un montÃ³n. Tripode mas que  recomendable se mueven las estrellas que  da gusto...normal con tanto  aumento.
5,In a single word its great.
5,Amazing as a first step into astronomy.You can see so much more than with the naked eye but you can still navigate across the sky with relative ease.
5,Get effect
1,El producto llego defectuoso de fabrica lo debolvi pague mas de 40 euros de gastos de devolucion y todavia estoy esperando que me lo devuelba mala experiencia.
5,Image is sharp just a bit heavy - will need a tripod
4,fantastic for night time looking never seen so many planets
3,FÃ¼r terrestrische und Naturbeobachtungen SchÃ¤rfe zufriedenstellendschwach RandschÃ¤rfebei astronomischen Beobachtungen unbefriedigende AuflÃ¶sung und PunktschÃ¤rferelativ groÃes Blickfeldauch fÃ¼r BrillentrÃ¤ger gute Funktion.
5,One of the best product I have bought ...its cheap..n well services..its zoom capacity is 10x and eye relief is good ..it is good for the beginner astronomy lovers
5,Fantastic. The moon looks amazing through it. The weight isn't as bad as some suggest and the bracket for tripod fixing was gratefully appreciated.
5,A very good product.it is well packed and i think it is the best product.
5,Ich kann das GerÃ¤t ohne von der Technik etwas zu verstehen absolut weiter empfehlen. Ich bin aber ein Leie ich kann aber nur sagen dass es mir jetzt mit diesem GerÃ¤t richtig Spass macht die Sternen zu beobachten.
4,Good product
2,Needs Collimation
5,Preis Leistung passt mehr als perfekt bei diesem Produkt. Wollte ein Fernglass das funktioniert aber nicht extrem teuer ist da es nur gelegentlich eingesetzt wird. Obwohl es so gÃ¼nstig war funktioniert es sehr gut bei Tag wie auch in er DÃ¤mmerung.WÃ¼rde es wieder kaufen.
5,Son unos prismÃ¡ticos que sirven para ver a muy larga distancia recomendable para caza o para ir de turismo o algo. Por ejemplo para excursiones a la montaÃ±a y tal una fantÃ¡stica y practica decisiÃ³n ya que se podrÃ­a dar un buen uso a la hora de ver vistas.
4,Great for sky viewing quite heavy
3,As good as one could expect for the money.  The two sides do not quite line up.
5,A little heavy and tripod is a must
4,La relaciÃ³n calidad-precio es estupenda. El Ãºnico pero es que efectivamente pesan bastante y hay que estar apoyado en algo para mantener la estabilidad. Por lo demÃ¡s una gran compra!
5,MUY BIEN
1,Ich habe es im September 2012 gekauft. Geht gerade noch zum ruhig halten. Im jahr 2016 konnte man im Fernglas die kleinen Gewitterfliegen sehen. Im gleichen Jahr hat es von aussen Regen abbekommen es ist aber auch drinnen feucht gewesen. Nach dem Trocknen sicht man leicht verschwommen. Im Jahr 2018 lÃ¶st sich das Gummi langsam auf.
5,Excellent Product totally paisa vasull
1,Falling apart after a couple of months
5,PrismÃ¡ticos espectaculares los uso para ver la Luna y se ve perfecta lo Ãºnico malo es su peso para usarlos a pulso (tampoco es exagerado) pero con un trÃ­pode perfecto
5,Easy for beginners. Good for star gazing..
5,Good beginner star gazing binoculars
5,Excellent large aperture binoculars for the money.Really need to be used on a tripod or at least in a comfortable well braced position.
1,there is a zoom lever in the operating book and you don't know it on the binoculars. it's a screw
5,Fantastic christmas present for the fiance who loves star gazing.  The reviews were realy helpful. Delivery was fast too.price was good and he said he loved them.
4,Una buena opcionpara todo tipo de observacionvinieron super protegidosy llegaron perfectosdesparar y listos.Son grandes y algo pesados pero tienen un monton de aumento.
5,Great image but a bit big to be walking mobile but I'm still glad I got them big means a better closer image its a trade off I'm happy with.
3,trÃ¨s bonne jumelles trÃ¨s lumineuse le zoom est puissant le seul bÃ©mol le poids un trÃ©pied est recommandÃ©. c'est pour cela que je ne lai ais pas gardÃ© dommage.
1,Dessus du produit. Jâai reÃ§u les jumelles trÃ¨s bien emballer pour Ã§a rien Ã  dire mes en regardant dans les jumelles il y a de taches Ã  lâintÃ©rieur dâune loupe. Jâai bien sÃ»r nettoyer les 2 verres mes rien ni fait . Donc en regardant dedans pendant 2/3 minutes je commence a avoir mal Ã  mon yeux gauche rÃ©sultat elle me serve Ã  rien. Ils pourraient dans les jumelles le fournisseur qui les vendent avant de les envoyer au client. TrÃ¨s dÃ©Ã§u de mon achat
5,These are great for stargazing and can fasten onto a tripod for use as they are quite heavy to hold.
5,These binoculars are brilliant compered with much dearear one's very good magnification with clear optics  and googd quality build  would recomend they are quite heavy but still good.
1,FÃ¼r den Preis ein hervorragendes Fernglas bis auf einen wichtigen Punkt: Mein Exemplar (und laut Netzsuche viele viele andere Exemplare) litt an Fehljustierung. Die Bilder waren vertikal zueinander versetzt Kollimationsfehler nennt man das glaube ich. Musste jedenfalls erst recherchieren wie der zu beheben ist dann extra dafÃ¼r einen 1 mm Schlitz-Schraubendreher besorgen. Gummiummantelung am Griff anheben und zur Seite drÃ¼cken und an einem winzigen SchrÃ¤ubchen drehen alles extrem unpraktikabal aufwendig unnÃ¶tig. Anscheinend null QualitÃ¤tskontrolle.Ein solcher Zusatzufwand ist meines Erachtens intolerabel daher 1 Stern zur Warnung anderer. War drauf und dran das Teil zurÃ¼ckzuschicken. Wer mit Nachjustierungen kein Problem hat kann aber gerne zuschlagen.
5,Son geniales
5,Hier passt das Preis-LeistungsverhÃ¤ltnis. Bei der VergrÃ¶Ãerung ist allerdings ein Stativ empfehlenswert. Eine gute Beobachtung kann man nicht "frei Hand" machen. Wenn man sich anlehnt oder die Arme auflegt geht es so gerade eben.Am Nachthimmel sieht man Details im Mond und sehr viele "Sterne" mehr als mit dem bloÃen Auge.
4,Muy buenos. Tal vez un tamaÃ±o un poco... demasiado grandes. Montados sobre el trÃ­pode aumenta su estabilidad y precisiÃ³n sobre todo para ver las estrellas y la luna.
5,...... bei diesen VergrÃ¶Ãerungswerten und diesem Preis. Kam leider "schielend" bei mir an. Wer aber keine zwei linke HÃ¤nde hat und der hier unter den Bewertungen angegebenen Justierbeschreibung folgt kann sich sehr gut selber helfen.
3,Buena relaciÃ³n calidad precio sin embargo (y tal como se dice en los foros especializados) los prismÃ¡ticos vienen descolimados lo que resulta desconcertante para el que pretende usarlos por primera vez. Consultando los foros por internet se consigue calibrarlos con un pequeÃ±o destornillador. Esto deberÃ­a venir corregido de fabrica.
1,Pedidos 2 seguidos y los dos descolimados.Inutiles para observar el cielo en condiciones....El segundo no lo he devuelto y me he arriesgado a ajustar los tornillos para colimarlos y parece que se pueden usar al menos en observacion terrestreya veremos si para el cielo nocturno..Los he ajustado por no gastar 2 Ã³ 3 veces mÃ¡s en otros mejor fabricados y solo los puedo recomendar a quien se atreva con los tornillos de colimacion (debajo de las gomas y perdiendo la garantia;ajuste delicado y no se si duradero).En resumenuna loteria aunque los de Amazon se portan de maravilla con las devoluciones y por probar...Eso sicelestron nunca mais.
1,Box received was open & torn and felt liked used Glass coating on both view & objective lense were scraped. It's made in china which is not mentioned anywhere in product discription
5,Just upgraded from 10x50s these are awesome!! So much more than 50% viewing.
5,Good at night any longer magnification and they would have to be on a tripod a bit heavy but I wanted them for Aircraft spotting and they are jusy brill
5,Very good
4,A good pair of binocular for sky gazing. Although a bit heavy while viewing verically  a tripod is a must .
5,He tenido la suerte de que llegaran bien colimados. Aunque sÃ­ es verdad que presentan aberraciÃ³n cromÃ¡tica y se empaÃ±an cuando hace mucho frÃ­o por lo demÃ¡s cumplen con lo esperado. RelaciÃ³n calidad/precio 5 estrellas. Muy buenos para iniciarse a la astronomÃ­a si el presupuesto es limitado. Â¡Los estoy disfrutando un montÃ³n!
5,TrÃ¨s bonnes jumelles.Un peu lourde
5,Made a great birthday present for my Dad!
5,Arrived earlier no problems with the binoculars.
2,Habe es mit einem vorhandenen 10x50 Fernglas verglichen und keine "Verbesserung" fest gestellt... Habe es deshalb an Amazon zurÃ¼ck geschickt...
5,Ideal fÃ¼r kurze AusflÃ¼ge am Sternenhimmel. FÃ¼r lÃ¤ngere Beobachtung empfiehlt sich ein Stativ. WÃ¼rde es weiter empfehlen da ein gutes Fernglas :o)
4,Brilliant binoculsrs
5,Todo perfecto
4,Really too heavy
5,Una pasada
5,Excellent binoculars I highly recommend these for astronomy if you get a tripod too.  Great for looking at The Moon.
5,Buen producto y a buen precio muy recomendable
1,Auch wenn das Ding sehr gÃ¼nstig ist ist es trotzdem schade um das Geld.Bei solchen Produkten zeigt die Erfahrung dass man ein paar Euro mehr ausgeben muss und ein QualitÃ¤tsfernglas kaufen sollte.Ich sehe mit meinem Zeis 10x42 zu jeder Tages und DÃ¤mmerungszeit wesentlich besser als mit diesem GerÃ¤t.Leider keine Empfehlung!
4,Es increible lo que se puede ver a traves de estos prismÃ¡ticos ademas la visiÃ³n es fantÃ¡stica tanto para el dÃ­a como para la noche.
5,Excellent item Promptly delivered
5,15Ã70 super
5,Buenos binoculares para los que se inician en una astronomÃ­a bÃ¡sica. Dado su peso y capacidad de aumento imprescindible un trÃ­pode para visualizar sin fatigar la vista. Calidad de imagen aceptable. Muy Ãºtil tambiÃ©n para excursiones para ver mamÃ­feros a distancia teniendo presente su peso.100% recomendables
5,I can see Uranus from my back yard!! Yeh
4,Very Good!
3,Very good quality product but I don't find focusing device with it while it was shown in the pigture.
3,QuizÃ¡ por inexperiencia cometÃ­ el error de pensar que a mÃ¡s aumentos mejor pero ahora creo que me sobran aumentos y los cambiarÃ­a por precisiÃ³n. No obstante los prismÃ¡ticos cumplen con lo que se espera y si dispones de un buen soporte se pueden conseguir resultados buenos.
3,GerÃ¤t top (5 Sterne)- dazu empfohlener Stativadapter Ã¼berflÃ¼ssig da im Angebot fÃ¼r Skymaster ohne Hinweis darauf inbegriffen  und ist im Preis enthalten
2,On ne voit pas grand chose juste la lune en plus gros...
4,Fantastic Product!!
1,I bought it after reading many good comments but this has very serious collimation problem. I would suggest people to buy from local shops after checking.
5,Amazing product.Unbelievable range and accuracy.VFM - Value for money!!
5,Amazing
2,Control de calidad muy bajos. En mi unidad venÃ­a dentro de un ocular una pelusa realmente grande!.He solicitado reemplazo y esperemos que todo llegue correctamente ya que parece que corre a cargo del factor suerte segÃºn otros comentarios.
1,Went to use for first time at my caravan and they are broken
5,Great Binoculars for the money. Wasn't expecting too much for the price but they really do perform well. Ideal for stargazing as well as "normal" use.
2,One of the lenses has odd colour shift at sides unless you look at things dead-on. Itâs annoying.

1,Zoom is not appropriate
4,ESTÃ BASTANTE BIEN LOS PROBÃ EN EL CAMPO Y LA CLARIDAD E LUMINOSIDAD POR LA OPTICA ES BASTANTE BUENA PARA SEL PRECIO QUE TIENE.
3,Ve que tiene algo de aberraciÃ³n cromÃ¡tica y la observaciÃ³n es algo incÃ³moda por la relaciÃ³n entre el relieve ocular y la pupila de salida. Si observo sin gafas la funda de goma de los oculares no permiten visualizar bien todo el campo.

5,Son unos prismÃ¡ticos muy buenos por la relaciÃ³n calidad/precio. Un detalle muy importante es en trÃ­pode  hay que tener uno bueno uno muy barato (20-30â¬) harÃ¡ que la imagen tiemble mucho segÃºn los ajustas o sopla aire si haces observaciÃ³n en campo.
5,Excellent Binoculars at affordable price.Due to excellent objective lensthe Binoculars are awesome.A must buy Binocularsexcellent service from fotocart.
5,Un poco pesado pero la calidad de la imagen es muy buena
1,Feel cheated ...the initial 15 days of purchase it was cloudy..so couldn't test it...after I tested...I tried to return some ...10 day only policyToday in our astronomy society met a friend with same product but different...The problems are magnification and two imagesThe astronomers told some prism adjustment problemWhere should I go for itThe astronomy society had a cheap self built telescope Newtonian that is assembled at a price less than this binoculars but the magnification is fantabulous
4,Good standards from amazon. Product was good as expected.
5,Son unos de los mejores prismaticos que he utilizado con una excelente calidad/precio. Dan una vision muy nitida y el peso aunque cansa un poco con el tiempo no es excesivo. Recomiendo totalmente su compra.
4,Bastante buenos. El precio muy interesante. No obstante aconsejo comprar tambiÃ©n el soporte porque aunque el peso no sea excesivo lo requiere
5,As expected. You'll need a tripod as the binoculars are quite heavy.
5,An excellent pair of binoculars. The only minor thing I don't like is the flimsy lens covers.
5,Excepcionales prismÃ¡ticos tanto para uso astronÃ³mico como para observaciÃ³n terrestre. Son muy luminosos y tienen un gran campo de visiÃ³n pero debido a su peso (15 kg) necesitarÃ¡s un trÃ­pode para observaciones prolongadas. Lo mejor de todo su  relaciÃ³n calidad/precio y la rapidez de entrega.
5,Se trata de unos prismaticos con una apertura decente y buenos aumentos. No tienen excesiva aberracion cromatica y resultan comodos. Estan al limite de lo tolerable para aguantarlos a pulso y lo ideal es contar con un tripode para su uso sobre todo para observaciÃ³n astronomica
3,Good buy too heavy for my young kids excursion activities
5,Amazing to watch the night sky through them. It's a little heavy pair of binoculars (8kgs) I would certainly recommend a tripod along with it.
5,Love it. The packing is awesome..the magnification is great. Yes it is heavy but the result is great. I do wish I got a bundled option with a tripod..
5,colis arrivÃ© dans les dÃ©lais. pas de surprise Ã  l'arrivÃ©e. tout complet. fonctionne parfaitement. compte tenu du grossissement je recommande un trÃ©pied . cordialement

5,geniales. se puede ver jÃºpiter y satÃ©lites galineanos saturno y la luna. no recomendado en cielos de mucha contaminaciÃ³n lumÃ­nica pues no verÃ¡s todo lo que dan de sÃ­.
5,Son enormes si pero tienen mucha luminosidad y una calidad de vision excelente. Compra recomendada. Un poco mas pequeÃ±os serian mas manejables pero se perderia la fantastica relacion de los 15x70. Otra opcion seria que tuvieran zoom pero es de suponer que perderian en luminosidad.
5,Das Gewicht die Einfachheit und gute Handhabung Ã¼berzeugen.Die Bedienungsanleitung ist positiv zu bewerten was oft ja nicht der Fall ist.
5,Schnelle Lieferung. Sehr gutes Fernglas! Bin mit der VerarbeitungsqualitÃ¤t zufrieden. In meinen Augen sehr gute AuflÃ¶sung. WÃ¼rde ich mir wieder kaufen! Im gemÃ¼tlichen GestÃ¼hl tolles Fernglas fÃ¼r's Sternespechteln.
5,Muy luminosos para uso astronÃ³mico. El cromatismo es bastante tolerable sobre todo considerando el precio. En general un gran producto para iniciarse en la astronomÃ­a de aficionado pero ponerlos en un trÃ­pode es imprescindible para poder disfrutarlos.PD: El servicio de Amazon tambiÃ©n muy bien.
3,Its ok for the beginners.However it is a bit heavy you can not hold it for the long time.Better you handle with care

2,Los mÃ­os llegaron descolimados y aunque de dÃ­a no se note mucho de noche veÃ­a dobles las estrellas . En su excelente servicio Amazon me ha devuelto el dinero. Dudo que vuelva a comprarlos por muy baratos que esten. Uno de los que compraron los skymaster 20x80 dice que lo comprÃ³ tres veces y en las tres le vinieron defectuosos.
3,Very heavy to carry
4,El producto me saticface la seriedad y atenciÃ³n en el envio tambien solo me quejaria en la inmediates del cobro del producto gracias.
5,Ein super Glas klar gibt es bessere aber zu welchem Zweck und Preis Freunde !Kann es nur empfehlen und wÃ¼rde es wieder kaufen.Yes !!!
1,Canât see any planets with this
5,Excellent
5,Por este precio vale la pena adquirirlos (60E). Se comportan bien en uso terrestre y sus 7cm de apertura ayudan en los aspectos astronÃ³micos. ConstrucciÃ³n sÃ³lida aunque un poco "plastiquera". RecomendarÃ­a encarecidamente el uso de un trÃ­pode para poder aprovechar todo su potencial.
5,Super Fernglas ich benutze es um VÃ¶gel zu beobachten und diese zu bestimmen. Durch das hohe Gewicht ist ein massives Stativ unbedingt zu empfehlen.Die SchÃ¤rfe und der Sektor sind mehr als ausreichend.
4,quizÃ¡s despuÃ©s de leer mas de una valoraciÃ³n del producto me esperaba algo mas pero para empezar como es en mi caso suficiente.

5,Son excelentes para observaciÃ³n del cielo nocturno. No tiene mucha potencia pero es ideal para principiantes. No me arrepiento de esta compra.
5,tres bonne qualitÃ©
5,After months of research I am Glad I chose these
5,great value and convenient to use when getting a telescope out is just too much hassle.
5,After research the product was ordered on its merits and value for money. Found the product lived up to the recommendations.
1,A la rÃ©ception de ces jumelles constatation d'un angle important sur le corps d'un objectif. Apparemment il avait Ã©tÃ© montÃ© de travers et le filetage Ã©tait abimÃ©. L'autre objectif Ã©tait aussi dÃ©vissÃ© mais droit.J'ai renvoyÃ© ces jumelles et en ai demandÃ© le remplacement.La deuxiÃ¨me paire n'avait pas le dÃ©faut de la premiÃ¨re mais semblait reconditionnÃ©e. La gaine autour des objectifs Ã©tait abimÃ©e.j'ai quand mÃªme essayÃ© ces jumelles et j'ai constatÃ© un jeu important dans le support des oculaires. Ce qui ne permet pas d'assurer un rÃ©glage parfait et stable de l'image en observation il suffit d'appuyer les yeux sur les oculaires pour qu'elles se dÃ©rÃ¨gles. Je les ai donc renvoyÃ©. J'ai peur qu'elle soit remise dans le circuit telles quelle.
5,Muy buenos.
5,Preis-Leistung sind Klasse! Bei einer 15-fachen VergrÃ¶Ãerung ist ein Stativ notwendig schon der Puls verwackelt das Bild. Der  empfohlene Stativadapter ist Ã¼berflÃ¼ssig denn Celestron legt einen gleich bei.
5,ErfÃ¼llt alle Erwartungen in der Preisklasse und zu dem Preis - mit Stativ sieht man die Sterne ganz klar. Sehr leicht!
5,WONDERFUL PRODUCT REALLY GOOD FOR SKY WATCHERS.
5,Muy Buenos
1,Not at all worth the money! Should be priced at Â£35/45'Attachments' cheap quality and unfinished specifically cheap webbing on bag and straps typical cheap China product accessories!Very disappointed eye strain and hard/unable to focus properly
2,Rather unweildy
5,Una vez ajustados los visores quedan  perfectamebte enfocados. PensÃ© que estaban descolimados pero afortunadamente no ha sido asi. Recomiendo su comprar.
1,no colimation esta dos imagen en estarias para la basura. no compra.
5,Bietet gute Ergebnisse. Ist fÃ¼r meine Begriffe aber etwas zu schwer. Ein Stativ mit metallenen Adapter ist unbedingt erforderlich fÃ¼r lÃ¤ngere Aktionen.
5,Son unos prismaticos fantasticos se ve de cine mucho aumento mucha luz  mucha nitidez y mucho campo de vision.Vienen muy biÃ©n con su funda y un acesorio para acoplar a tripode y por un precio de risa totalmente recomendables
5,tiene una calidad de imagen y un alcance impresionante ademas el precio esta muy bien. Lo peor es el tamaÃ±o ya que este producto al ser grande y pesado tienes que apoyarlo el algÃºn soporte para estabilizar la imagen.
1,Ob das Fernglas gut ist kann ich nicht sagen. Bei mir kam es jedenfalls unjustiert an und man sah alles doppelt. Das war das dritte online bestellte gleiches Prozedere. Online scheint man keine Fernglaeser kaufen zu koennen. Ging wieder zurueck. Ruecksendung problemlos.
2,Compre este producto para observar estrellas. Es bastante mÃ¡s barato que un telescopio y creÃ­ que podÃ­a ser un buen comienzo.Sin embargo al recibirlo me di cuenta que es francamente difÃ­cil de usar. Los 15x hacen que cualquier minima vibraciÃ³n se amplifique hasta hacer casi imposible ver nada ni aun usando un trÃ­pode.Finalmente los he devuelto y por supuesto Amazon ha cumplido perfectamente con el abono del producto.
5,built for some great star gazing fun but needs a good solid tripod because its heavy to hold for extended periods of star gazing.
5,Good optics for a beginner well made it comes with a tripod attachment I am new to this but very impressed
5,GOOD PAIR OF BINOCULARS. WELL MADE AND WELL PRICED BY CELESTRON.
5,Jumelles trÃ¨s lumineuses qui permettent de faire de l'observation astronomique animaux nature ... TrÃ¨s lumineuse. L'observation d'Ã©toiles nÃ©cessite pour Ãªtre optimisÃ©e une stabilisation (trÃ©pied ..).
2,La molette de mise au point ne fonctionne plus (rester bloquer position basse) jumelle devenue inutilisable puisque rÃ©glage distance focale impossible.
1,Absoluter Fehlkauf hat sich beim Auspacken schon zerlegt... Dazu noch der Gestank! Optische Leistung auch eher mau! Das kÃ¶nnen andere besser!
5,Great image quality and good fast delivery. Aleady viewed Mercury Venus Mars and Saturn in just one week.
1,salio defectuoso nos devolvieron el dinero
5,sehr schnelle Lieferung bin mit dem Celestron Skymaster 15x70mehr als zufrieden.Ich glaube nichtdas man fÃ¼r das Geld etwas besseres bekommt.Das Fernglas wÃ¼rde ich sofort wieder kaufen1

5,Excelentes prismÃ¡ticos.La observaciÃ³n terrestre es espectacular y la astronÃ³mica sorprendente.Necesario un buen trÃ­pode y un adaptador metÃ¡lico para colocarlo en el mismo.Con el de plÃ¡stico que trae de serie se mueve bastante.Saludos.
5,fantastic  just  what i  wanted
5,No soy muy entendido en estos temas pero desde luego todo el que prueba mis prismÃ¡ticos queda impresionado mÃ¡s cuando le dices lo que han costado. Eso sÃ­ pesan un poquito pero claro es lÃ³gico.
5,Das Celestron Skymaster  hÃ¤lt was es verspricht. Hab zu unterschiedlichen SichtverhÃ¤ltnissen benutzt und habe gute Sicht gehabt.Fazit :Jederzeit wieder
5,Grate value for money ...
5,Excellent
5,OMG that is sooo nice
5,Me lo recomendaron y no me arrepiento en absolute: la impagen es muy nÃ­tida y el aumento sensacional. Lo uso para observaciÃ³n celeste pero para terrestre tambiÃ©n es muy recomendable.
5,La primera vez que miras la luna con ellos te quedas alucinando. Son grandes pesados obviamente y muy recomendable usar un trÃ­pode para visiÃ³n celeste. Se pueden utilizar para visiÃ³n terrestre y son una pasada.
2,The magnification on these is such that they're almost impossible to use without a tripod. The image was also disappointingly fuzzy. I wanted them for stargazing but they are clearly not designed for this so I sold them after a couple of months and bought a pair of Pentax 8x which have proven far more suitable.
1,Me ha llegado muy descolimado
5,Despues de leer los comentarios de los demas usuarios me decidi a comprarlos y el resultado es muy bueno.Son expectaculares para su precio recomiendo la compra.El envio como siempre super rapido
1,There was no seal on the box and there were  minor scratches on the hooks of neck strap and manual book also seems to be used one if we buy something new it has to be new
5,Es lo que esperaba todo perfecto
5,Kann mich der bereits zu diesem Produkt verÃ¶ffentlichten Rezension nur anschlieÃen. Das Ferngls Zeigt auch nachts ein klares Bild ohne wesentliche "Bildfehler". Ist ausreichend lichtstark auch zur Sternenbeobachtung. Mit einem Stativ gut verwenden.
1,I bought them on recommendation and the pair I tried were excellent so I ordered some.First pair arrived and gave a very bad double image so thinking I was just unlucky I returned them for a replacement which were almost as bad. Ended up with my money back. Quite disappointed.Amazons returns system is very good though for these problems

5,Perfectos para uso astronÃ³mico y terrestre muy luminosos estÃ¡n en el limite de peso para usarlo sin trÃ­pode a poco en forma que estÃ©s no te costarÃ¡ nada usarlos.
3,la lente deja un poquito que desear quizÃ¡s es porque estoy acostumbrado a la calidad de los nikon por lo demas estan decentes.
5,Excellent product. Recommend the Celeston 71009 to anyone.

5,ES ALUCINANTE AUNQUE EL PROBLEMA ES SU PESO Y MOVIMIENTO DADA LA LEJANIA POR ESO PIDO EL TRÃPODE Y PODRE VER MEJOR. GRACIAS
2,It was found damaged when I got it. It had a double image when you looked through it.It may have been dropped in transit though so I'm not  necessarily blaming Celestron as my friend has a pair of these and they are great.
5,Buen producto de buena calidad. Puedes observar mas estrellas de las que me imaginaba. Respirar hondo y relajarse para evitar el tembleque jejeje.
5,muy bueno nitido de gran calidad. lo recomiendo.muy bueno nitido de gran calidad. lo recomiendo.muy bueno nitido de gran calidad. lo recomiendo.
5,muy buena calidad -  precio. Estoy muy contento con la calidad de la imagen que se aumenta y su manejabilidad.
5,Se ve pe recto y por la noche muy bien me a impresionado la nitidez que tiene lo recomiendo si dudarlo.
5,Great Bino`s no cons
5,Exceeded my expectations love these.
5,- Cumple con mis necesidades sobradamente tiene mucha calidad y lo recomiendo sin ninguna duda a todo el que me pide consejo.
5,Para cielo o terrestre fenomenales se ven muy bien muy contento con la compra. Claridad de vision y alcance sobrado.
5,Los mejores prismÃ¡ticos astronÃ³micos en relaciÃ³n calidad-precio. Vienen con un adaptador a trÃ­pode pero la verdad que es bastante dÃ©bil.
5,buena calidad y contraste relacion calidad precio excelente.no es un telescopio pero cumple bien su cometido en alcance y calidad
5,Perfecto cumple las expectativas que tenÃ­a sobre el. Eso si es necesario usarlo con trÃ­pode. Lo estoy disfrutando mucho .
5,Aunque es algo pesado es muy bueno. Su peso obliga a un trÃ­pode si queremos fijar bien lo que observamos.
5,Maravilloso para ver la Luna. Para observaciÃ³n de aves rapaces o aves en general en vuelo muy bueno. Lo recomiendo
5,GREAT STABLE GOOD FINISH
5,Muy buenos lo he usado ya 3 o 4 veces tanto de dia como de noche y se ve muy bien.
5,Quick perfect delivery. Best product
5,Do not buy telescopesbuy this one...
2,Not so good for the specific purpose
2,No son demasiado robustos. Las almohadillas se mueven y pesan muchisimo. Los anillos para enfocar se despegaron. No estoy satisfecha.
5,these are fantastic
5,Brilliant :-D
5,Excellent product
1,Can't focus the binoculars not even at far objects. According to other reviews lots of people seems happy with them so I guess I was unlucky and got a lemon. Bad quality control beware.
1,VenÃ­an defectuosos.  Estaban descolimados por lo que se veÃ­a doble imagen. Tuve que devolverlos y ya es la segunda vez que me llegan asÃ­.  He solicitado el cambio por otros y si vuelven mal ya seria la tercera vez y solicitarÃ© la devoluciÃ³n del dinero. Gracias.

2,no good sent back
2,this is aNice instrument but with a lot of chromatic abberation which I suppose is normal for this cheap price
1,Lo recibÃ­ descolimado y pese a intentarlo no se consigue colimar adecuadamente. No lo he devuelto por pereza ... ...
1,Vaya decepciÃ³n al marearme sÃ³lo de ponÃ©rmelos en los ojos. Estaban absolutamente descolimados (falta de paralelismo entre las lentes). Los devolvÃ­ y me devolvieron el dinero.
5,I bought these instead of a telescope and am very happy with the product. but you will definitely need a tripod(sturdy). great for star gazing.
5,They are a perfect replacement set.
5,Superaron mi expectativa!!! Recomiendo usar un tripiÃ© para mayor comodidad en su uso el acercamiento que tiene a los objetos es impresionante! Pude ver la luna con mucha claridad sin duda considero que son una excelente adquisiciÃ³n para aquellos que nos queramos iniciar en la astronomÃ­a
5,IncreÃ­ble lo que se puede lograr con ellos
5,I cannot review yet as I am giving it as a Christmas gift.
5,Me gustaron estos binoculares de gran alcance mejor que algunos telescopios y puedes ver la luna con gran claridad lo Ãºnico que veo de desventaja es que son pesados puedes mantenerlos pero a larga cansan.
5,Me gustaron estos binoculares de gran alcance mejor que algunos telescopios y puedes ver la luna con gran claridad lo Ãºnico que veo de desventaja es que son pesados puedes mantenerlos pero a larga cansan.
5,La calidad del cristal de los binoculares es impresionante su claridad es mayor que inclusive la de algunos telescopios.
5,Vi reseÃ±as del producto en YouTube sugiero que si lo vas a comprar hagas lo mismo para informarte bien. PrÃ¡cticos con tripiÃ© para terrestre y cielo. Valen la pena buena calidad.
5,Excelentes binoculares valen lo que cuestan vi comentarios que necesitan trÃ­pode para usarse por el peso y si es necesario si vas a ver algo mÃ¡s que la luna no cansan si los sostienes por perÃ­odos prolongados lo que mÃ¡s me sorprendiÃ³ fue la claridad de imagen
3,Product is good. But very heavy. Cannot operate for longer than 5 minutes without tripod. Not suitable for children due to dimension and weight. Not easy to carry. Would take smaller one in future
5,Es simplemente bueno cumple por completo
2,Muy buena definiciÃ³n pero a pesar de llegar muy bien empaquetado llegaron rotos y no me quisieron hacer el cambio por unos en buen estado.
1,I could not understand why it was out of focus from the very first time. I used them once. Today I actually went to use them for the first time. One of the brackets is broken that holds the eyepieces equidistant from the lens. I have no way to prove that it was already broken when I received it.
5,DespuÃ©s de buscar e investigar en internet los mejores Binoculares astronÃ³micos acabo de comprar estos binoculares Celestron 15x70 son los mejores calidad precio buena calidad y estupenda visiÃ³n y alcance las imÃ¡genes se ven estupendas. PensÃ© mucho si compraba tambiÃ©n el trÃ­pode pero ahora se que es indispensable ya que despuÃ©s de un rato los hombros se cansan. AsÃ­ que solo espero que llegue el trÃ­pode para probarlos pero por si solos estos binoculares son maravillosos.  Estoy satisfecho con esta compra.
5,Excelentes prismÃ¡ticos los comprÃ© para observaciÃ³n astronÃ³mica y funcionan de maravilla estoy incursionando en este apasionante hobie y el campo de visiÃ³n mÃ¡s los aumentos que te proporcionan son ideales para saber bien lo que estÃ¡s mirando tambiÃ©n son muy buenos para observaciÃ³n diurna pero realmente el trÃ­pode es indispensable
5,Un peu d'abÃ¨ration chromatique mais on voit loin.
3,No puedo ver cÃ³mo se ajustan los binoculares al trÃ­pode no hay informaciÃ³n de como hacerloEl ajuste de los oculares para enfocar estÃ¡ suelto mirando hacia arriba el ocular se va dasplazando hasta que se sale del cuerpo de los binoculares Â¿cÃ³mo se ajusta?
5,These are really great.  It's just awesome to look at the moon and see all the fine details.  Recommend using a tripod as the hand can make it shaky to focus.
5,Pesquisei muito antes de comprar vÃ¡rios vÃ­deos e comentÃ¡rios por quase um mÃªs em plataformas diferentes apps YouTube e etc...... Enfim pelo dinheiro que eu poderia gasta no momento COMPREI! Estou adorando. Para quem nunca teve um e quer brincar de se surpreender procurando ver no dia dia e tambÃ©m no cÃ©u estrelado  coisas legais que jamais veria a olho nÃº. Compre compre. Ã um pouco pesado vai tremer na mÃ£o um pouco. FaÃ§a um teste com o seu celular no zoo mÃ¡ximo aÃ­  sua casa e tente tirar uma foto nÃ­tida de uma imagem longe. Fazendo isso vocÃª entender o que quero dizer( a tremedeira vai vir a tona ) dependendo da respiraÃ§Ã£o de cada um e quanto tempo de observaÃ§Ã£o porÃ©m com o tripÃ© problema resolvido. No resumo vale a pena ter esse se vocÃª nÃ£o quer gastar muito e ver coisas muito loucas pertinho. Ops! Cabe aqui mais uma observaÃ§Ã£o veio bem protegido no saco bolha  na caixa tudo original sem risco arranhÃ£o perfeitinho e chegou 10 dias antes do prazo. NÃ£o ganho nada por expressar aqui nessas linhas minha opiniÃ£o.No meu ver eu jÃ¡ ganhei!!! Em ler outros comentÃ¡rios que ajudam numa decisÃ£o e por satisfaÃ§Ã£o do que jÃ¡ recebifalo. Top! Top! Top!
5,I paid an extra $4 on the postage and receive from Australia to NZ within 36 hours of ordering can't get much better than that and packaged real well. Tonight was our first clear night in ages so was able to view the moon wow amazing. Was like I could reach out and touch her. Could see the craters and these monoculars have great focus. Had to use my old tripod as my arms got a bit heavy as it's quite a weighty set. Seen heaps of stars that you can't even see with your naked eyes. I've used it during the day as well to look at the terrain. I can't see the Harbour Bridge from where I live with the naked eye but with the Binoculars I could see the cars travelling up and down it. Harbour Bridge is 13.19kms (8.2 miles) away from me as the crow flies. So overall I'm pretty impressed with these binoculars. Celestron Sky Master 25 x 70.
5,Amazing views of the moon and night sky
5,Amazing quality for so little money.Anyone thinking about buying a cheap telescope please consider buying celestron15x70 skymaster binoculars.$125 AUD delivered. They attached to an old camera tripod i found at a garage sale couldnt be happier with my purchase.
5,I was debating between a wide and high magnification range and ended up going with this mid range magnification. I get the benefits of wide field astro viewing while at the same time being able to see enough detail on large celestial objects like our moon. Paired with a cell phone mount and tripod I've been able to take photos with descent results. They aren't super heavy but should be securely held or mounted on a tripod. The strap included was disappointing however. Would have been better if it was more like a camera strap with some padding. Optics are well made resulting in great images. Eyepieces are comfortable with or without glasses. Photo taken using binoculars with the cellphone mount and tripod.
5,I have steered away from the longer binocs in favour of compact Bushnell 7x35 for birding and Nikon 8x20 for backpacking. Knowing I can rely on Celestron (got their telescope & spotting scope) I took a chance when I got a really good price on an unused second-hand unit through Amazon. FIRST balance is pretty much the same as standard 7x35 so no torque on your wrists. Ditto when mounted on the tripod attachment on a Manfretto tripod. SECOND optics are what you expect from Celestron clear field all the way across [NB: I've had double lens replacement so I just set the right ocular at zero and enjoy parfocal]. THIRD rubber eyepieces fold down and the iPhone attachment is easily made [use the left ocular]. FOURTH as a Christmas present for my daughter it arrived Christmas Eve had to do some fast talking to explain that Santa sometimes just slaps a shipping label on the box to get it here baster. We enjoyed lying out on sleeping bags with our various optics. A Moon party is planned with her friends. ONLY DOWNSIDE is a rather thin unpadded lanyard will need to get something to bad her neck.
5,Son muy buenos binoculares llegaron antes y en excelente estado.
5,Super buenos binoculares los recibÃ­ bien empacados y sin ningÃºn defecto. Se los regalÃ© a mi papÃ¡ para que viera los volcanes desde su depto. La calidad es super buena son algo pesados y luego de un rato marea por lo que es super recomendable ponerlos en un tripiÃ© (se incluye adaptador).SÃ­ los recomiendo!
5,Cant go wrong for just over $100.  I was a bit leery after reading many reviews about collimation issues but no problems at all.
5,It was a huge differnce from our old 8 x 40.  While heavy I can hold it and focus and see things.  So much better.  We live on the side of a mountain overlooking a valley and when there is an accident or other event we can zoom in and see what is happening.  So much to see now.
5,Me sorprendiÃ³ la calidad Ã³ptica muy clara la imagen. Consideren que se requiere utilizar un tripiÃ©.
1,I would like to return these as they fogged up overnight in the first week of use!
3,Compre unos binoculares como estos y ya no sirven funcionaban bien  pero algo paso con la perilla de enfoque esta como atorada  y ya no se puede enfocar  no encuentro donde repararlos o como hacer  valida la garantia?
5,Para el precio es una buena compra. Algo pesados pero te adaptas.
5,wide field of view makes them easy to pick up targets when they are hand held. on a tri pod  you can pick out targets that you didn't know were there.  if you have never used long distance binoculars you may enjoy these 15x70's  there are higher magnification glasses to be had for sure  find what you like  I'm very pleased with these  highly recommend
5,I really like how you can get something with quality for a good price
5,Exelente binocular como si vas empezando como si eres experto. Lo comprÃ© mucho mÃ¡s barato de lo que vale ahora pero es algo de lo que no te arrepentirÃ¡s por su desempeÃ±o.
2,These are good - good optics and clarity. It came with a seperate tripod mount which is what I wanted but I have no idea how the mount is supposed to be installed.
5,Muy padres para ver el cielo y la luna es recomendable comprar un tripoide para disfrutar mejor la vista que da el cielo
5,Si ya tienes un telescopio y buscas una herramienta que te permita tener mayor campo y la flexibilidad de poder tener una sesiÃ³n de observaciÃ³n in promptu vas a amar estos binoculares.Bien empaquetados y protegidos llegaron a mi puerta en solo 16 horas. Excelente colimaciÃ³n buen funcionamiento mecÃ¡nico (ningÃºn detalle) buena Ã³ptica (el recubrimiento casi no refleja luz) y accesorios decentes (la bolsa y el adaptador funcionan; el strap para colgarlos parece broma). Representan un excelente valor dado el precio durante la mÃ¡s reciente promociÃ³n (de hecho mÃ¡s barato que en USA).Al recibirlos en los primeros 10 minutos de prueba pude observar las Pleyades las Hyades El cÃºmulo doble en Perseo y para mi sorpresa M31 con una extensiÃ³n ligeramente mayor que en mi pequeÃ±o reflector de 4.5". Todo desde mi jardÃ­n en medio de la ciudad. El enfoque es preciso el relieve ocular suficiente y cÃ³modo la aberraciÃ³n cromÃ¡tica es prÃ¡cticamente inexistente con la posiciÃ³n ocular adecuada y dentro del 85-90% del campo de visiÃ³n. A pesar de que no tengo mucho interÃ©s por la observaciÃ³n lunar estos binoculares me estÃ¡n haciendo cambiar de opiniÃ³n con su efecto casi tridimensional.Son pesados y grandes. Para una sesiÃ³n de observaciÃ³n casual puedes sostenerlos en tus manos unos pocos minutos. Si quieres estudiar los objetos en turno necesitas un buen soporte. O bien un tripiÃ© fotogrÃ¡fico de buena calidad sÃ³lido y que puedas subir hasta la altura de tus ojos o un monopiÃ© para observar sentado. En mi caso lo he solucionado con una excelente base de micrÃ³fono para estudio y un adaptador bastante robusto que carga 3 kg.Muy recomendables. Si los ves a buen precio no lo pienses no te vas a arrepentir.
5,Must have for beginners into sky or bird observations
5,The images are crisp. You actually can spot small speckles of light around Jupiter they are the moons. At that magnification (15X) you only see small speckles of reflected light. But still the crispness is enough to see them clearly not blurred. Moon craters are also very cleard. And you can also focus as close as 15m for birds.But it is heavy think about it if you plan on taking them on a walk to watch birds. You will also need to put some pad around the neck strap or use a different neck strap. The provided neck strap is like half an inch wide only. At that weight it would feel bad on the neck unless you use a padded neck strap.
5,Mon conjoint aime regarder les Ã©toiles et les avions
3,Good binoculars with a tripod they seem to be good quality and not very expensive. But they are not powerful enough to see much at night
5,El aÃ±o pasado adquirÃ­ unos 25x70 y me decepcionÃ³ mucho la pupila de salida.  Estos binoculares son increÃ­blesâ¦. Lo mejor quÃ© hay en el mercado en costo beneficio para los que se estÃ¡n iniciado en ver el cosmos.  15x70.  ðð»ðð»ðð»
5,Thanks. Works a treat
5,A Amazon sempre me surpreendendo  recebi meu BinÃ³culo quase 1 mÃªs antes do prazo estimado.AtÃ© hoje todas as minhas tratativas com eles foram espetacular!!! Super recomendo!!!
5,Excellent binoculars  can watch the moon all night.
5,The product is as described. I use it for some star gazing and also outside at sporting events - rowing and racing. The magnification is superb aperture is correct for the magnification. But you do need a tripod. Unless you are planning on viewing items fairly close to you (think racing) then for anything more distant you must have a stable platform. I have and it is worth it.
2,One of the Binocular tubes was completely loose. I have tightened them by hand so I hope they are ok.
5,Excelentes binoculares. Un poco pesado por lo que necesitarÃ¡s un tripiÃ© si quieres imÃ¡genes estables. He alcanzado a ver a Jupiter con sus lunas la forma de saturno y cÃºmulos de estrellas. Una excelente inversiÃ³n pero considera comprar un tripiÃ© para una mejor experiencia
5,para tenerlos en las manos son algo pesado..tengo que apoyarlos en otra cosa. voy a ocupar un tripie
5,Je vais les utiliser pour voir des tours de tÃ©lÃ©communications
5,Cotidianamente uso estos binoculares para uso astronÃ³mico (y en ocasiones para paisaje). Permite ver varias nebulosas y cÃºmulos grandes (como la nebulosa de OriÃ³n y el cÃºmulo del Cangrejo) asÃ­ como para encontrar estrellas dÃ©biles de las constelaciones (esto es principalmente Ãºtil en lugares con mucha luminosidad por ejemplo yo observo en un cielo con escala Bortle 6-7 ).  El Ãºnico inconveniente que encuentro es que despuÃ©s de un tiempo y una larga observaciÃ³n se vuelve cansado observar objetos recomiendo un tripie como auxiliar (aunque no es forzoso).
5,El material se ve de muy buena calidad y llegÃ³ en perfectas condiciones. Es perfecto para ver el cielo en la noche incluso con un poco de contaminaciÃ³n lumÃ­nica.
2,It is heavy so your hand will shake while holding it . So you can not get a clear image of Stars or moon . It is better to sell with a tripod . But as long as you use a tripod  whatâs the point of using a binocular ?
4,Es increÃ­ble la resoluciÃ³n estÃ¡n pesados por lo cual no se disfruta ver astros en la noche si no hay pedestal pero en general fue una gran compra
5,Me encantaron se ve super bien en definitiva los recomiendo
4,Es increÃ­ble la resoluciÃ³n estÃ¡n pesados por lo cual no se disfruta ver astros en la noche si no hay pedestal pero en general fue una gran compra
2,The binoculars I got are extremely shaky and will requite a tripod to use effectively. I hope that will make them useful because by themselves they are useless to me.
5,No es difÃ­cil de usar para principiantes esta perfecto y cuenta con buenos accesorios.
5,Excelente producto muy buena visiÃ³n a larga distancia
4,When I received my First pair of these I looked up at Mars and unfortunately I saw two Mars(es). Thanks to the Amazon Primeâs great return policies I sent those back and bought a second pair which is much better. It can focus well on planets and even Jupiterâs moons but there are some of what they call chromatic aberrations in the lens.Being an amateur I still really appreciate the pair that I have.Proceed with caution...
1,Al mirar por los binoculares se aprecia una pequeÃ±a rayadura en el lente derecho. No es suciedad pues ya lo limpiÃ© bien al parecer es un defecto interno del lente. La garantÃ­a solo aplica para EUA y CanadÃ¡ o directamente con un distribuidor autorizado.
5,As it was mentionned it is heavy which its good as kids only wants to used our smaller ones.
4,I like these cans but the case is cheap and the lens covers do not fit - front and back - and fall off routinely when inserting or removing binoculars from case. Inexcusable really. How hard is it to get a couple of molded pieces of plastic that fit snugly.
5,Excelente embalaje son grandes pero ligeros. Perfectamente colimados... Muy recomendables
4,Un mÃ­nimo de descolimaciÃ³n. Se pudo arreglar puesto que las devoluciones son engorrosas desde el lugar donde radico por la situaciÃ³n de pandemia.
5,AS PER ABOVE COMMENT
5,Perfectos para empezar a ver las estrellas no se van a decepcionar
5,Binoculares professionales  muy buena calidad en las opticas y en el material de construccion.sin embargo son muy pesados debes tener muy buen pulso y concentracion para obtener observaciones claras y estables.si los adquieres hay que planear a posibilidad de comprar un tripie para mejores observaciones.
5,Awesome binoculars looking at the moons craters impressive.
5,Me encantÃ³  no tengo mucho conocimiento pero son unos prismaticos de buena calidad y precio accesible.
