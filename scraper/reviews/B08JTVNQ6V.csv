3,Was told by tech support that this is what I needed to install a new head unit in my 2011 Silverado.  I had it all wired up and all that worked was the radio.  I called tech support back and was told that with this I would lose the the door chimes key in the ignition chimes would not have steering wheel controls and a couple other features I would lose.  The second tech I talked to directed me to the correct wiring harness I actually needed to keep all the factory features.  Was not happy that I had to disassemble everything to send it back and put my old stereo back in until the new harness arrived.  Always get a second opinion it'll save you a ton of frustration and headaches.
5,Works great for flat screen aftermarket radio. The 2010 Chevy needs an antenna extension adapter and look up videos on installing the power wire to a key accessory switch (your radio will not power on and off without wiring this correctly).
4,Instructions are lacking but this does work. Find the OEM wiring manual for your vehicle and match up the slots not the colors of the harness.
5,Works like it's supposed to
4,This harness seems to be of good quality and has simple to follow diagrams.  Definitely on bar with other more well known brands
3,Not the worst thing in the worldbut not the best. Got the job done with some frustration along the way
2,The issue that I had was not the quality nor the timely arrival  the plugs were nice and they snapped right onto my factory harness which was great !! The problem that I found was that even tho it fit my factory harness it may be used for a multitude of similar vehicles and not my specific model which it said was  I had to wind up not using the product because none of the wires that were used for my car we’re actually in the correct location on the said product they were pinned for some other model  I am not trying to say that have a bad product or anything of the quality because it is very nice  I just think if they say it it simple and plug and play which was what it said then that is what it should be   or make it for the specific model and actually know what it will actually plug directly into and work without causing someone to have to make their own harness which is what I had to wind up doing  I was just very disappointed in that aspect  and also when I went to the instructions it gave all mode break downs except for mine but they kept telling me it was the correct one for my car
3,Product in the end is fine they just need to do their homework on what wire actually does what
4,This product has confusing instructions for vehicles that amazon says fits. I rebuilt my wiring harness twice for my chevy cobalt because the products instructions were not clear to my vehicle. I had to search the chevy cobalts wiring harness use my stereos harness instructions and these ones to figure out what i had going on singularly to me. I have no problems with the product itself i have had no issues with that it was just the instructions were a bit confusing.
5,I tried this harness in a 2007 Hyundai Santa Fe to connect to the factory radio harness and it fit perfectly.  Redwolf customer service is amazing.  I had some questions on the harness and reached out to them via email. I got their response the next day. Excellent & prompt communication.
4,You absolutely can get this to work perfectly but have to be willing to relocate some of the pins. This takes a simple wiring diagram of you vehicle (which they supply) and a bit of understanding.Overall the connector itself works great and the wiring connections were solid.
2,It didn't work on my 2012 chevy Malibu It clicked into position but you loose loads of car features including the chime. I bought a ridiculously expensive alternative that retains the car functions including the chime.
5,I’m not an expert on car stereo's but it seems to work just fine on my 2009 GMC 2500hd.. of course I don’t have SWC or Sub./Boss system.Hope this helps.
2,Didn't work
1,I bought this for my Chevy HHR. The amount of chaos this thing brings is amazing. The wires aren't even placed in the correct places. Theyre just random. They dont even match their own instructions. Somehow theres 3 pink wires on mine. For some reason my ground wire is green. I cant even figure out my ignition wire i dont think they even added it in.Update: This part isn't even correct for most newer GM vehicles. Vehicles like the chevy HHR need a GMOS-LAN inferface kit so the stereo works correctly and your warning dings still play. The kit has this harness already built in which makes this thing effectively useless.
4,Instructions are not the best. But easy to use and install
4,Instructions were unclear and hard to understand as compared to a pioneer harness
2,The it did not directly fit the Chevy Impala so I ended up getting the pin out from the service manual online and wired from there. The idea behind the harness is to make it plug and play and I can understand a few wires being off or not used but for how far off this was it was a waste of time. The instructions do vaguely tell you if the pin out is off you can move them again the purpose is not to have to do this. Two stars for us but maybe this works perfect for other models or years.
4,Was what I was looking for. Color codes don’t match and some of the wires needed to be relocated. Wires are on the lite side even the power/Ground wires should have been a little heavier then provided.
5,Buena calidad facil de instalar es un buen producto
4,I like it. The instruction quality was a little crazy but after reading the whole thing it was easy.
1,It says it will fit a 2010 Chevy Equinox but as I’m going to install an aftermarket radio in my widens car I’ve found out that it in fact does not fit. Now I have to go and order a different wiring harness and waste even more time dicking around with this than I had originally planned to.
3,Wires miss marked for factory placement.  Had to rewire part of it to make it work.  ACC wire in wrong location had to find a different one all together.  Not great in my opinion.
5,Perfect harness for a 2007 Silverado 1500 LTZ package. I went through 3 harnesses that all claimed to be exact fits for my stereo system and this was the only one that was true to its word. Fit perfectly and was an exact match to what I needed.
1,This harness is a big time joke. Purchased for 2007 Silverado. Plugs fit factory harness everything else after turns to crap. Wire colors do not follow universal color codes for aftermarket radios. The color key in the instructions is Completely wrong. I do not want the headache of chopping a harness or testing each wire individually. SAVE YOURSELF A HEADACHE AND DO NOT BUY.
1,2009 Impala. Supposed to work but doesn't. I tried it with the proper colors then tried just lining up the wires. Do hear my CD player turning but no lights no sound. Am returning.
3,good products just order the wrong part
5,It was easy to install and I got it over night
1,Wire Colors or off does not work for 2007 Tahoe
2,Only works with old  body style 2007 Chevy’s Silva Rado not with the new body style must have interface
1,Not as described. This won’t match the vehicle mentioned in the description.
3,Were does the red cable Goes? Only able to get constant power all the time? 2010 silverado
2,The plug matched a 2011 hhr with onstar it took a little bit of knowledge to get it wired correct as only 1 speaker worked the stereo was backfeeding killing the dash and marker lights.The only reason I didn’t return it and go to a stereo shop was the shop wanted 150$ but it would have been worth it
1,Had to go to an actual audio shop for the to tell me the harness I got is for a impala. And he was right because none of the colors mtach.. waist of my money had to buy a whole new one.
3,Directions are a little tuff to follow other than that not bad.
1,Completely sucked. I have wired dozens of stereos in my life with aftermarket harnesses and this was by far the worst.  Incorrect labeling in instructions of wires.  Two different wires labeled same function no ignition switch wire in the plugs to connect to factory plug.  I guess they think that we are just supposed to figure it out in the blind.  I will order a reputable brand harness next time instead of the first thing that says it fits my vehicle.
1,Work of advise … check your cars wiring schematic before splicing the harness. The wiring directions to not match up with the GM 16-pin connector harness.
1,You might as well splice directly into the truck itself then use this wireless harness that doesn't match up.2011 Silverado basic work truck
1,Didn’t work properly
1,No matter what the description says it does not fit a 2011 Chevy Equinox
5,Directions are easy to follow and detailed. Install was a snap and works great for a great price!
2,Amazon shows this fits my car. Far far far from it. On star requires something completely different.
2,The ones I got came messed up from the factory. There were 4 wires that were not tired into the prongs properly. Took me over 2 hours to figure out the issue..
1,Does not work. Wiring must be wrong because my aftermarket radio is brand new and works with a different wiring harness. Don’t waste your money. It wouldn’t even power on with this.
2,Instructions in broken english unclear could use a nice diagram with colors maybe the whole GR thing is really confusing when there is grey and green. Just saying.
1,This does not fit 2012 Chevy Express 2500 series. Really disappointed and now setback has I have to get another wire harness to hook up my new aftermarket double din stereo with backup camera. The harness plug part definitely fits now the wires and the corresponding wires in the vehicle do not do the same function. Like for instance KOEO situations I have 12 volts on B vehicle side but on the harness it gives 12 volts to the wrong wire that goes to my radio. I literally need to pop out the individual wires and reshuffle them basically . Thanks
2,This item should come with an add a circuit. I have installed many radios in my time and this is the first time I have had to purchase a separate item to install an aftermarket radios with a harness that is supposedly made for the vehicle.
3,Good
1,Not one of the speaker wires were pinned correctly for my 2010 HHR..pure Junk don't waste your time or money
5,Exactly what we need to install our boss touch screen radio
5,It does the job. 07 Silverado
1,It did not fit like it was said to. Ordered it exactly for my truck but the plug was not the same as what my truck had. Contacted them to confirm but never received anything from them
5,Plugged right in
1,It was not the part I needed by description it said it would work for my car never did
1,The item come in two separate wiring harnesses the wires in one bundle do not match what they should in the truck. Things plug in but it’s connecting the wrong wires hopefully it didn’t ruin my new stereo!! Buyers be ware!!!
1,Plugs were a match but the pins do not!!
5,2006 Impala w/o factory amp. It fit perfect
5,Works great
2,Not correct I ended up purchasing a different harness without an issue.
1,Some of the pins didn’t make contact so I had to bypass and hardwire 3 leads. The directions/color chart is a tiny photocopy and very confusing. Poor quality junk. Spend a few bucks more to get something that actually works.
1,it fits perfectly but the enclosed instructions are wrong and mean you can't use it to wire up the stereo.I asked him to send me correct documentation and he just sent me the same thing I told him was wrong.
1,Instruction for my car was use function 2. Instructions guide only has function 1 listed. Tried both nothing. Hopefully my stereo isn't ruined. My favorite part was the 2 right front speaker + . Dont get scammed like me.
1,Does not fit my 2011 Impala.. direction says I canove the pins. First off I'm not moving any pins.. never could find the ing wire.. this set looked like spaghetti.. 3/4 of the wires don't plug into anything.. never got any sound or power... Don't waste your time
1,This product was not wired up even close to the factory connections for the 2010 HHR.  Buyer beware as the wires are nicely labeled but go to wrong locations so don't short out your head unit or other items.
1,Not the right harness for these vehicles. The wires do not match up and your radio will not have power. Save yourself the time and just buy an interface kit.
1,Easy to install but wires were not in correct spot
1,This crap will leave you guessing. I returned two radios just to find out these wires are incorrect. They suck.
1,This does not work on a 2010 gmc sierrah 1500. Most of the wires went to the wrong place.
1,If they can't label the instructions correctly do you think the wire harness is made correctly..... It's not
1,I disliked the fact that I ordered it for a 07 tahoe.. yet I had to repin certain wires to get power..
1,Ignition wire is no good. Garbage waste of money
1,Didn't work for 2007 Chevy equinox. Plug fit but wiring was not right. Ended up buying one from autozone to get it to work.
1,Wrong connects  it doesn't hook up to an buick
1,It did not work wrong configuration with my trucks wiring at all
1,Can confirm this product doesn’t work on the impala limited series. You’ll need to bypass the factory boss amp and this kit doesn’t include the tools to do so
1,GM PRODUCTS SOMETIMES REQUIRE A MODULE TO PREVENT THE DASHBOARD FROM FREAKING OUT!!!!! BEWARE
1,Wires or not in the right place colors do not match this product is junk
1,Installed it and no sound.  Just wasted my time.
1,Will not work on Chevy Malibu
1,Had to get another one from abc auto store. Pins were messed up and half of my speakers didn’t work
1,Wrong one
1,Doesn’t work no power no sound
1,doesn't work complete waste of time and money. says it will work in a chevy but it does not
1,Do not buy !!! Doesn’t actually work for what it says
1,Didn't work
1,I would give less stars if I could wired completely wrong..... 2012 Chevy Silverado
1,Just Wasted 9 hrs
1,Complexity wired wrong
1,Item fits factory plugs but hooking it up to a 12v switched power supply with long red wire made the dash stop working why??? And the car needs a chime box false statement that it fits a 2010 Chevy Malibu
1,This product does not work for a 2009 Chevy Silverado. It was set it by a professional and the power switch wire is either non existent or in the wrong location. Do not recommend.
3,Encaja bien con el plug de mi GMC Acadia pero El orden de los colores no corresponden con el del plug del carro.
5,Did the job
1,This is by far the worst kit I've ever purchased! While the plugs did fit I had to pull nearly every pin and re-pin the adapters for my car so they would match the factory wiring. My advice go to Crutchfield and get it right the first time. Never buying anything car stereo related from Amazon again!
5,This did not work with the Bose system in this Silverado.With Bose You need a professional installer or chimes warnings and rear speakers wouldn't function.
5,Easy to install
5,i needed a wiring harness for my 2009 impala. got one here. it was quick and the right one. thank you amazon
5,I needed these to update my husband's factory radio to a new touchscreen work out nicely
3,Good for power ground and speaker connection on my vechile that’s it nothing extra will work because doesn’t come with module for data bus
1,Not a single wire is in the right pin verry disapointed now i gota spend the time i didnt want to in the begining to figure out what wire goes were total waist of money someone just randomly pluggs wires in random spots non matched up and i mean not a single wire
5,Exacto para mi coche gracias
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Everything works great
5,fit perfect works as it should you DO need to run  your own signal wire (red) but is pretty to do for anyone who understands wiring
5,That's excellent.
5,Exelente
5,Would recommend.
5,Had no dislikes & was very easy to install
1,Well its @ least a GM plug. I had to repin everything but the yellow & black. So if ur smarter than me save ur money or learn something they didn't get right. 08 Silverado 1500 LT does technically fit just won't work. Good luck!
3,I used this in an aftermarket in dash nav system to maintain the vehicle warning chimes and signal light turn chimes (in a 2008 Chevy Silverado). You can hear the chimes but if the radio is on you can’t hear the signal light chime and there’s no volume adjustment. It works but could be louder.
1,This item DOES NOT WORK. It was brought to a radio repair shop to see what is wrong with this item. Their report said it does not work. This item needs to be replaced ASAP.Wayne Kennedy
4,Never really got use it but doesn’t seem to complicated
1,wires/pins in wrong spots - had to change a bunch compared to truck and still didnt work. talked to installer and told me to get a different one
1,bought these for a 2012 silverado the plugs fit but the wire colours are totally wrong. i had to manually go through gm wiring diagrams to make the connections. i also did run a separate wire to ignition. they got the job done but it was a headache.
1,Not Good!
5,Compatible avec silverado 2008
5,It worked perfectly
1,Equinox 2007 sa fit pas la ..
