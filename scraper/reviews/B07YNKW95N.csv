5,This is my second surface pen. The first I bought directly from microsoft this one through amazon (still microsoft). Both pen tips have stopped working within a matter of months. I have replaced the tips themselves and gone through all the troubleshooting and the pen still will not write. All the other buttons work just not the MOST important part of the pen. The warranty on this pen is garbage once it is out of the 30 days I cannot seem to keep it working. When the pen is working I absolutely love it! I keep the pen in safe place as I know that it can be fragile as any device. The support page runs you through the same things over and over again but there is not a good or user friendly way to contact support. I would like a replacement or refund but of course the return window is too short fot that.
3,I'm an artist & student. The pen works how I want it to in both my art software of choice and for note taking. However I prefer to take notes the old fashioned way as my handwriting is unsuitable for digital notes. I use this and a Surface Pro 7.This is my second time purchasing a surface pen; my first one lasted me 2 years and I only had to change the battery once which is nice as I do use the pen often. However I was careless and dropped it so it began inking while hovering. While running around outside for class related purposes I dropped it on bare pavement; needless to say it officially died there. I noticed it was on sale so I decided to nab another one otherwise I would've gone with a Wacom pen.So far it works as intended. There are 4 things I notice between this pen and the one I originally had that I'm not fond of.1. The body is noticeably lighter than my old pen even with batteries removed. Not sure what's up with that. The new one is BARELY heavier with the battery in than my old one with no battery.2. The LED is blurry. The old one was a crisp dot; this one not so much. It was a bit hard to capture.3. The eraser button has a weird spring-y metal sound when pressed? Whereas the old one was a clean click.4. Bluetooth was significantly harder to setup. I press and held until it started blinking but it blinked maybe 4 times before stopping. I had to leave the battery out for a minute and put it back in to actually pair it.So I've come to 2 conclusions: this is either a knockoff or the overall quality of the surface pens have deteriorated in the last 2 years. If you're looking for a pen just go with one from a company that actually specializes in software for artists/designers. But it does what I want it to do so I'll use it regardless.
5,I love this pen so much. I have a Microsoft surface 3 and it does exactly what they say! It's like a mouse
5,I had a cheaper brand one and I didn’t like it but I’m sick of pads of paper everywhere so I went for the expensive one with the button eraser gimmick… LOVE IT…don’t leave home without it
5,To start off with I'm actually using a Surface Pro 3 tablet NOT the 2017 Pro... I may or may not be hoping for my Pro 3 to just suddenly crap out in hopes of justifying a purchase of the latter. Until then you're going to get a review and subjective results of this 2017 pen on a late but great Surface model.I have been using the Pro 3 with the Pro 4 pen for a long time and debated over the switch to the 2017 Pen for the $100 price-point. After succumbing to the lure I have to suggest that fellow Surface Pro 3 users do the same (and with 200% confidence for users still using the Pro 3 Pen... what have you been doing with your life!?).The biggest reason comes down to the lower initial activation force (IAF). Before biting the bullet I remember reading conflicting reports and reviews on Reddit about whether Surface Pro 3 and 4's would support the IAF improvements. I can't do the objective testing now that I've sold my old pen but can tell you that my writing has become notably more precise and consistent which lower IAF would certainly result in.More objective examples of improvement:- With the Pro 4 pen I had the pressure sensitivity setting at a 10 or 11 to accommodate for the many skips in handwriting I would get with my furiously scribbling notes. Of course that resulted in a lot of over-pressurized and unwanted carry over lines and curves. With the 2017 Pen my pressure setting is on anywhere between 4-7 and it's perfect. No skips!Some caveats: I do a ton of note-writing and doodling but can't comment on drawing shading or any other 'real' artistic endeavors. In addition improvements are more notable in Onenote and Sketchable and less so in other apps (e.g. Xodo Drawboard). I also scribble exceedingly fast so that may explain why the IAF improvements have been obvious for me. If you're a normal human writing at sub-80mph speeds maybe the differences won't be as noticeable?- With the Pro 4 pen I had to use the 2H nil-friction nib because my handwriting looked the best (albeit still with intermittent under-recognition and over-pressurization issues noted above). However with the 2017 Pen I'm actually still able to use the standard HB pen because the pen performance is better enough to overcompensate. Now I can simultaneously enjoy the slight friction across the screen which is more reminiscent of real note-taking.Other reasons I like this new pen more:- The magnet inside the pen is much stronger. My pen is actually able to stick onto my Surface enough that I now feel comfortable tucking the whole device under my arm and walking around.- The annoying clip is gone. I never used it to begin with and it just got in the way. You may feel the polar opposite about this however.Of note the advertised improvement in sensitivity levels is NOT available for Surface Pro 3 (or 4)! Microsoft promised a firmware update for the old Surface Pro's with support for the tilt-feature but the specific release date still hasn't been announced.Some other tidbits of info you may care about:- The weight is exactly the same as the Surface Pro 3 Pen (20g).- It only comes with 1 nib (the HB one). I almost want to dock a star for this because it's such a cheapskate sell to not include the pack of pen nibs (like Surface Pro 4 pens did) especially since the HB rubbery tip WILL wear down. If there's one thing I can swear to you it's that.- Download the Surface app from the Microsoft store if you haven't already. You can adjust the pen pressure sensitivity and turn off the [annoying] Windows button.- I was able to use this pen and my old Pro 3 pen almost simultaneously. Each one was able to be recognized the moment I brought it to the screen. Ok this may be a completely useless fact after all.- I found the following tips on various Reddit threads in improving pen precision and performance and have definitely found them helpful (I made sure to adjust these after I used the 2017 Pen for >2 weeks as to prevent confounding):1) Go to control panel --> mouse settings ---> Pointer Options tab --> uncheck "enhance pointer precision" box.2) Control panel --> Pen and Touch settings. Under Pen Options tab ---> go to press and hold settings --> uncheck "enable press and hold for right-clicking" box. Under Flicks tab --> uncheck "use flicks to perform..." box.Don't ask me why... just do it.I hope this review helps anyone using the Surface Pro 3 specifically!2018 UPDATE: As much as I still love my Surface Pen the Apple Pencil definitely outperforms it for both note-taking and drawing purposes. See the additional handwriting comparison sample I just uploaded. The differences are particularly noticeable when I'm scribbling quickly.(Amazon uploads images in a bizarre fashion so you may need to zoom in a ton on the handwriting sample I uploaded.)
4,Work great with the Surface pro 8 but I received the wrong color. I order the icy blue and got platuemn instead. Would like the icy blue but don't have to to resend it & wait for the right color really need it know.
5,It is the perfect companion to my surface pro 5
4,I got the icey blue - however it's not even close to what's showing on the product description as "icey blue".The picture is showing more like the cobalt blue version. The actual icey blue is very grey with slight blue tint.
4,the pen is really laggy on one note. The whole reason I got it. Works fine for pdf documents…
5,You can't live without it if you're into sketching. It also does a fantastic job of translating my writing into machine readable text.
5,I lost my $100 pen and I had to buy this one I work in a office and do a lot of note taking  I need it quickI got what I paid for 😌🙂
5,Had to retire my old tilt pen which I used on the daily for note taking on my Spectre aw0xxx because a soft drop from my desk caused the tip to break and bricked the pen.Just experienced a much harder drop of my new surface pen on the floor and this time the initial impact was straight on the 2H tip not a scratch! The fragility of the HP tilt pen (and the rest of the hp pens that carry a similar design) is it's main flaw and the surface pen has nothing of that!Some more advantages I noticed:+ No more battery anxiety because a single AAAA battery will last me over 2 semesters easily with Bluetooth features enabled. That is compared to around 10 days a charge for the hp tilt pen w/o Bluetooth or 8 hours with Bluetooth on. A rechargeable pen isn't for everyone certainly not for me.Add the peace of mind of having a rechargeable battery degrade on me over the next 10 or so years which the pen could easily outlive the AAAA is countering this planned obsolescence and is pro consumer in that regard.+ High quality nibs are abundant and affordable. Found a 3-pack of high quality uogic nibs (survived a 1m drop onto my floor) cost me the equivalent of 7 USD on Ali (couldn't get a set shipped to me from amazon because I'm not from the US). That is the opposite of the case with my former hp tilt pen 0 official replacement nibs and the only ones that I could fit on it (surface pro 3 pen nibs) eventually broke inside of it effectively breaking it entirely. Another point towards being pro consumer compared to HP.+ The magnets in the pen can latch onto my spectre laptop in about 8 different spots it's not designed to do that  on a non surface device per se but it's definitely nice because it's harder to lose/drop from the desk this way. HP pens have no magnets.+ The better weight balance over the HP pen makes the flip-to-erase function (which the hp pen also has) actually practical. I had to shift my entire hand to a different position on my old hp pen but that isn't the case with the surface pen which actually feels like a slightly heavier pencil that is still easy to flip over to erase with.+ Still fits in the pen pocket of the oem Spectre laptop sleeve- No clip means it rolls slightly more easily on my desk than the HP pen but being able to magnetically attach to my spectre counters that.- No dark coloured optioned only light blue/silver/red. I don't find it a big deal since at the end of the day I used it as a tool and not a fashion accessory but I slightly miss my Tilt pen completely matching my Logitech mouse's colour scheme.Considering the surface pen and the HP Tilt pen have similar MSRPs where they're sold The only reason i could see any HP convertible owner buying an hp pen is either blind brand loyalty or needing a rechargeable battery.
5,I use it to draw in my browser in pixiv sketch on a surface laptop 4.  It’s really easy to use to draw with. It’s my first time using a pen/tablet. No issues so far!I like how you can just pick up the pen and start drawing immediately. No need to press a button to wake up or power on the pen!
5,Works excellent with my daughter's Microsoft PC
5,Great pen works exactly as expected! Big win for me
5,The Microsoft Surface pen works flawlessly with my Surface pro 7.
5,I like it and it was very easy to use. I would recommend this product.
5,Estuve buscando un lapiz como este desde hace tiempo es perfecto y preciso un buen precio
5,I enjoy the smooth flow and comfortable design/weight. Easily paired with my tablet. AND color coordinated with my keyboard. Gotta love it!
4,Ive owned Microsoft pens and off-brand versions of surface pens. I would say this is a good balance between both. The real surface pen's button is slightly different this one's button doesn't work as the others should. But the weight and the touch screen feel are very nice. I would say this is a good product but its not 5 stars since the button doesn't work correctly and can mess with my workflow.
5,It was as advertised and OEM Microsoft Pen for my old Surface 3.The Right-Click button is awkward to use for some reason… but great outside!
5,This pen is great it’s very responsive and has pinpoint accuracy no pun (or pen) intended. In all seriousness though it was very easy to I pair with it surface and is quite responsive to pressures and things of that nature. I use it as a cursor and a pen quite often and haven’t had any issues with it. Is magnetically snaps to the side of my Surface Go 3 which has made it very easy to keep up with! If you don’t need the extra features that eh Slim Pen offers and don’t really want to pay the price of it then this is a good alternative if comes in different colors as well. The only thing you’ll need is to eventually buy AAAA batteries for it but the battery that I go with it is still good probably at about 90% after a few months of use.
5,Officially packaged in Microsoft box. The pen works great with my Surface Go 2. I did have to do a little tiny bit of work to make it work properly though.I did not have the latest driver for the onboard Bluetooth within the my Surface itself. With that being said after updating my firmware via Intel Bluetooth webpage EVERYTHING WORKED as intended. Smooth writing clicks work and is great to draw with.I am mostly a traditional artist that uses charcoal and pen so I am getting used to this medium. I have a Wacom bamboo tablet to draw with typically when it comes to digital art. While my Wacom is nice and has it's uses this surface pen is SO MUCH MORE CONVEINENT. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who would like to use a pen on their surface for any purpose.
5,works much better than the budget pen.  definitely worth it
5,I use it to write and draw for my online lesson. Writing feels very natural.
5,The surface pen is a great addition to my Surface Pro 7 experience. I love that it magnetically attaches to the Surface. The magnets are strong enough that it will not haphazardly fall off. The tip of this pen is nice and smooth I don’t have that tapping sound and feeling like the Apple Pencil. It feels like I am writing on paper which does enhance the writing experience. On the back end it can be used as an “eraser “ when writing. Also tapping the button will also bring up Windows Whiteboard an easy tap when I need to take notes.Again the Surface Pen is a must have if you own a Surface computer.
5,I got this to use with a Surface Book 3 it's more expensive than the generic surface pens but it beautifully matches the platinum color of my laptop. The erase function is one thing that I couldn't find replicated in any of the third party pens. They all have erase functions but not one that you can flip around like an eraser. The button on the pen acts as a right click from a mouse. The button under the eraser can be programmed to open any number of apps. You have to pair this using the Surface app to get the full functionality of this product. This pen includes a AAAA battery already installed this was something that I couldn't find a definitive answer about (before buying). The quality of the hardware is as good as Microsoft's tablets and laptops. Writing with this product feels better than the third party pen I have that costs $55 and it’s one of the best 3rd party pens available. I think this product is worth the money if you want the best experience and highest quality pen to use with your Microsoft device.Also just because I want to correct some things that other reviewers have said- these surface pens require replacement tips and they are not included. The first tip is included but not the extras you can buy them from Microsoft’s site or 3rd party ones on Amazon. You will have have to replace them every few months depending on how often you write with it. A worn out tip doesn’t mean it’s time for a new pen or that it’s a faulty product because it only lasted 3 months! Second thing- if this product is “shipped from and sold by Amazon services LLC” then it IS a genuine Microsoft product. I wish I didn’t need to amend my reviews to combat misinformation but someone has to set the record straight.
4,It’s accurate and I like the pressure sensitive tip though it does wiggle a bit more than I’m comfortable with and I’m worried it will break off. I wish the side button were easier to feel and that it were easier to press. I like the idea of the eraser button but I wish it were programmable (to pull up the keyboard for instance) instead of only being able to pull up microsoft whiteboard. Also I didn’t see this anywhere on the product page but it does have magnets to connect to the side of a surface.
5,Great product
4,Pen works great but the did send me the silver one instead of the blue one. It isn’t a big deal because it works just the same.
5,This pen is really nice. Pen tip on screen and sensitivity pressure is really good for art. The eraser magically feels like a real eraser on screen and works really well.Battery is estimated at 9 months and is super easy to replace.Magnets hold to surface book really good.
5,Good value!
5,Affordable and great quality.
5,Thank you
4,Works as expected and as I need it to. Only side note is that the color is not as vibrant as it is in the photo. (Red)
5,My original Surface pen was acting up - it would just stop working and I'd have to tap it hard on the screen to get it going again.  Anticipating a total failure in the near future I looked around for a replacement.I bought a $30 something off-brand that sounded promising.  What a disaster.  It worked but I'd get a lot of random right clicks that would bring menus up on the screen.  After a few days of that one I returned it. I should say that I avoided the Microsoft product because of the price.  But I stumbled on it here for $30 off and even though it was still twice the price of the knock-off I went for quality over price.Works just fine right out of the box.  I held it to my screen for about 10 seconds and it was recognized by my Surface so I was up and running in no time.
5,Ordered the blue one but got a red one despite the box being labeled blue. This was actually good because I misplaced the blue one a lot since it camouflaged with the surface case. Buying red from now on
5,Purchased this to use with a Surface Pro 7+ PC.  Works great with no issues found.
5,Just purchased a new laptop for school this pen makes it optimal for studying!
5,The pen was in pretty much perfect condition same with the box no dings or anything. It works just the same as my brand new pen I lost. Really the only difference between this pen and a new one is that the plastic peels are gone. Love that I didn’t have to pay 100 bucks for another one. I would definitely suggest keeping the pen in a pouch or pocket in your bag the magnet is pretty good but pulling the device out of my bag makes it pop off sometimes I think this is how I lost my other one.
5,The pen works very well with the surface pro x. I ordered this for my husband as a gift purchased the blue color but when I got it it was the silver one. 😞 My husband is happy using this pen 😄
3,I love the color and how convenient it is. However I just don't feel like I use it very often.
3,This item looks very much like a real Surface Pen right down to the packaging. However it does not function the same as a Microsoft Surface Pen.Be aware that the “eraser” end is not the rubbery eraser-type material that you’re used to in a real Surface Pen that makes erasing your work so simple. Instead this pen is hard plastic at that end. So don’t try to erase with it or you might damage your display.  With this pen you must touch exactly on the line that you want to erase and then push the side button. It takes some getting used to and is not always successful which is frustrating.Changing the pen’s angle to the display surface does not change the width of the line you draw.  So only basic writing and drawing with this one.Finally the magnet that holds the pen to the side of the display is not in the same position on the pen. This one has the magnet on the same edge as the button which is a poor choice. It does not hold the pen in place as it should—either because the magnet is weak or because the button prevents a good connection.Keep these things in mind when making your choice.  I may keep this as an inexpensive backup pen. But I won’t purchase it again.
3,I ordered the Ice Blue pen and received the Platinum version. No other complaints.
5,OMG! Night and day improvement from the other off-brand pen I was using before. I could not be happier with this pen. Yes it’s more expensive than the off-brands but based off the reviews I went with this one and I’m so so glad I did!
5,I love my surface pen. It always works and you can tell it is made to last. It is made of metal and has a very good weight to it. The tip is also very good in that it feels like you are writing with an actual pencil. It creates a friction as you write which gives it a more natural feel compared to others on the market. It also HAS AN ERASER on the top like a normal pencil. If you are writing and need to erase something you literally just flip it over and erase like you would a normal pencil. Many styluses do not have this feature and I really appreciate Microsoft for including this. I use it for taking notes in class and I know people who buy the 30 dollar styluses and they have had to replace them because they break multiple times in only 2-3 years. Save yourself the trouble and money this stylus has lasted me 3 years and still looks and works like new. After having to replace cheap styluses a couple times you would have spent the same if not more than just buying one of these styluses. If you have a Surface Pro this stylus is a no brainer. It has a magnet on it and ATTACHES TO THE SIDE OF THE SURFACE PRO. I cannot tell you how useful this is.  I know people that are always loosing their styluses and have to buy new ones this feature has saved me from ever loosing my stylus. I really cannot recomend this stylus enough
2,Amazon is apparently sending the wrong color to customers so be aware.The pen and the surface need improvement. This is my third pen and surface (in the course of work). They all have issues with drawing a straight line. If you've used an apple pencil you'll know what I mean.  The surface pen combined with the surface itself cannot render a perfectly straight line it's more uneven than it should be. It should be as good as the apple pencil but as most things are with Microsoft it's half baked.If you are ok with this (I am as it's the best option for my purpose - traded in an iPad for filling out forms) then you'll just be annoyed but happy that you can carry one less device.I hope that the surface pen 2 (slim) is better but the shape of it is again half baked and does not look comfortable.
3,This thing burns through batteries dude. I have a factory pen that is still on its first one and this has been through 3 in the last couple months
5,This review applies to the Platinum Surface Pen in use with a Surface 2017 model.The official Surface Pen has proved excellent in use.  It is comfortable in my hand feels natural against the touch screen writes with no lag has flawless palm rejection and attaches firmly to the magnetized side of the device.  My only problem with the hardware was that it failed to pair automatically with my Surface as the enclosed instructions stated it would.  Though far from expert I'm comfortable with technology and was able to pair it manually in seconds.  I suspect my experience was atypical so I did not subtract any stars because of this.Although I use my Surface primarily as a laptop with the Type Cover adding this Surface Pen definitely expands its functionality.  When precision mousing is required such as in photo editing or using OneNote's drawing tools to make a garden plan I can be more accurate using the pen's mouse buttons than using the track pad or a conventional mouse.  Thanks to the programmable eraser button with one click I can open a OneNote page to quickly jot something down without hunting for pen and paper even if I'm in the middle of doing something else with my computer.  I am no artist but I have poked around in my amateurish way with drawing apps that support direct on-screen inking and the conventional kind of program that would be used with a graphics pad and stylus.  In my non-expert opinion the Surface Pen would be an invaluable tool for any real digital artist.Finally a tip for the thrifty:  the platinum pen the least expensive color option matches the metal casing of the Surface.  It won't match your Type Cover but it won't clash with it either.  So unless you're bent on making a fashion statement pick the platinum model and save a few bucks.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 It is just beyond what I was thinking about electronic pens for tablets. I am using it for Microsoft surface book 2 and it works just fineeee.I have had many off market brands but non works as perfectly as the original pen I mean nothing to compare with this. Mine is red color and I love it. About battery life I'm not sure how long I can use it but it uses AAAA batteries which are found in amazon very cheap. I also use this pen to do Mathematics. Very cool in general.
5,A lot of money for a stylus but it helps a lot with the Surface Pro. This pen works wonders on the White Board option. The back of it even erases!!
4,It works great with my surface pro. I was sent the wrong color pen (ordered the ice blue got the platinum)
5,What more can you say about any product?
4,This MS Surface Pen works very well with my Surface Go. Simple set up... Does everything I expected it to do. Sticks to the left side or top of the tablet so it won't get lost. Useful for taking notes and sketching.
5,Microsoft pens are known for not lasting. More than likely you'll have to replace them long before ever replacing the actual pc.
5,Good size width and weight. Pairs quickly (instructions are precise and clear) and feels good to use/hold.
5,I’ve tried a bunch of surface pens at this point and this one is by far the best. I use it primarily for writing in OneNote and it’s awesome for that. It writes smoothly and is not overly sensitive to changes in pressure (which makes it easier to have a consistent thickness when writing). I also really like how it has just one button on the side that I can use for lasso select and an eraser on the end for erasing. All other surface pens I’ve found include both an eraser button AND a lasso select button on the side which means it takes me longer to find the button I’m looking for (since I have to feel around for each one to make sure I’ve chosen the right one). Also many other surface pens designs are completely evenly rounded which means you often have to rotate the pen in your fingers for a while to find the side with the buttons. But since this pen’s side button is on a flat side it makes it super quick and easy to find! The other fantastic thing about this pen is that it’s magnetic so it sticks easily to the side of the surface tablet (which most other surface pens don’t). The only downside about this pen is that it’s more expensive than others but I assure you that it’s well worth the price!
5,My old Microsoft pen broke. This pen is a simpler version of Microsoft pen. I like it as my fancy version was too confusing to use.
5,Love it works perfect
3,While it did work for the 1 week I got to use it it was fantastic. After then the pen stopping inking and only the buttons and eraser portion work. Tried troubleshooting with what Microsoft recommended and that didn't work. Will be reordering a new one maybe this one will work.
5,El producto le agrega valor al tablet es fácil de usar y funciona perfectamente.
5,Does as advertised and has a great weight for in hand feel
3,It works but the blue is more like Sky blue than a neutral blue
5,It draws very naturaly
5,The microsoft quality is good but I have bought plenty of knock-offs that are TERRIBLE.  I just swallow my pride and buy microsoft
5,I have a Microsoft laptop it’s not surface pro. And this stylus still works on my laptop. I was very scared that it wouldn’t be comparable. But I love it it works perfectly.
5,I've been a Surface and pen user since Surface Pen Red that was for the Surface Pro 3. While I've always been pleased with Surface Pen I am STUNNED by the amazing resistance/drag of this pen across the latest Surface screen.  It feels like a soft lead pencil drawing on a premium paper. I don't understand how the pen can have this feel without causing any kind of scuff or skid on the glass.  It just feels... impossible. I love it!The pen tracks perfectly and instantly even when you are 1/4 inch away from the screen. No delay.  The removal of the clip as compared to the older versions I had is a good move I broke that things and had to re-attach it multiple times. Also as compared to the previous model this one attaches by magnet to the side of the Surface Pro in a very confident and strong way-- you could drag the tablet across the table by the magnets in the pen-- but a twist and it unlatches without fighting. It's just perfect.I foresee myself using this pen a lot more than the previous one I had with then new Surface Pro and the pen things just keep getting better.I lust to play with my new Surface Pro setup with the Pen Dial and Surface Mouse. For someone in the late 30's computing hasn't been this fun in a long time!If you have any specific questions about Pro Pen Platinum please don't hesitate to ask them below. I travel a lot for work but do my best to answer questions when I can.
3,Looks fine shipped fast. Ordered Blue and received Grey.
5,Connected very easily with my surface pro. I just had to touch the tip of the pen on the screen for a moment. I have been using this for almost a month now and it's working good!
2,This is my second Surface Pen.My first one lasted a little over a year before my Surface Pro 6 stopped recognizing it. Battery was fine I replaced the nib and there was no noticeable damage. It just suddenly wouldn't connect anymore. Upset I bought this one in the fun poppy red. I was upset I had to buy a new $60+ pen but figured that since I use them daily for work that it wasn't the biggest deal in the world.I bought THIS poppy red pen in January. The 13th to be exact. It didn't even last 3 months before it did the same thing. I don't know if this is a programming bug or what but the fact this has now happened twice is very upsetting. This has wasted at least $120+ and now I am stuck with 2 unusable surface pens and a decision on if I should just get an off brand.I give it 2 stars because when it works it works beautifully! It easily connects to the tablet has a really long battery life and it practically glides across the surface tablet's screen. I use these pens for art which I spend a majority of my day doing. These are great pens. Or they would be if they actually worked long term.
5,The pen is smooth i highly recommend if you are needing one. There is no lag and it helps alot and there is nice features.
5,The pen is great works good much better than replicas.However be warned: for anyone going for the "ice blue" pen (EYU-00049). be aware that Microsoft Ice Blue looks more light gray than advertised. (As seen in the picture).In my personal opinion i didn't really mind but it was weird i got gray at first I thought there was a mistake or something alike but no.By the way on another note:  do NOT buy replicas/third-party pens if you have small handwriting not worth it they are just not accurate enough and have too many bugs... buy the original (like this one). save yourself time and money.P.S. Regarding the picture:The picture shows the suface pen in front a blue colored regular pen in the middle for reference and the box at the end. Notice that it does not much the advertised color atleat not as i see it.
5,IT IS TOTALLY NEW ONE.I’m about to buy my wife’s one too.
5,I use this pen for drawing designs for my quilting machine  so far it works great.
5,This is an official Microsoft product for half the price
5,This is a great product. Very easy to lose; definitely worth the money.
2,This surface pen will not work with the Microsoft Surface Go Laptop.  I did not call Microsoft to check on compatibility but I did not see anything in the description of the item warning me either.  My fault for not checking it out more thoroughly.  However I also didn't realize that if I returned this item I would be charged for return shipping.  I am definitely returning it as I have no use for it but I'm left very dissatisfied with the whole experience.
5,Pen is very practical easy to use works well with my Microsoft but it is not a there pen cost less saves me time in my note charting and keeps my life going! Only thing I would request would be a program attachment with some via blue tooth to find it when lost!
4,I woukd not consider this pen blue at all does not look like the pictures whatsoever we had to double check the box as we thought we ordered the standard grey/silver one.  Other than that great item and works flawlessly.
5,This was to replace the previous pen that came with my Surface Pro.  This pen works better than the original!
5,At first I was annoyed there was unbearable jitter after frustrating hour of use I found out the source of it all!My surface book palm rejection is the culprit  causing mini jumps as I touched the screen.Other things I liked / disliked :+tilt is great abd feeling accurate-touch screen is a big issue for me I have to use a spacial anti touch glove.+doesn't feel lile its ever going to brake even near the battery.-it uses AAAA BATTERIES they are rare and hard to find and it wont work without them+not heavy but not light and flimsy . About as heavy as a normal metallic pen.+it has eraser on the other end and its worth the higher price.+even light pressure would still write.
5,Arrived sealed in original packaging. Works as expected.  Premium feel and quality.  Usage is silky smooth with intuitive pressure sensitivity.  Love the eraser on the back. I know there is a newer rechargeable version but for a third of that one's price this is a good deal.
5,This has changed my life! I could never draw before but after having this it has changed all of that! It’s so easy to use and perfect for students or artists!
4,Very strange phenomena was discovered while using it. Intermittenly stops working and have to shake it to engage gyro mechanism (my guestimate) to turn back on. Still debating whether I should return or keep because I think price was fair for refurbished unit. I have feeling it was originally returned for the same reason I am experiencing.
2,I got this pen to replace the original which was lost while it was supposed to be magnetically attached to my Surface Book.  Compared to the cheaper replacements it is supposed to have tilt 4096 levels of pressure and Bluetooth.I use the pen with drawing applications like Photoshop Corel Painter Manga Studio Krita and Rebelle.  I do not use it for note taking annotations simple drawing etc.  My only experience is with the Surface Book.First I find it does NOT have tilt.  These applications typically have brushes that determine what appears on the canvas when you make a pen stroke for example a pencil trace or a chalk trace.  These brushes can have a sensitivity to pressure tilt and other pen parameters.  With tilt the line is typically wider when the pen is tilted.  I find that brushes that respond to tilt work as expected on my Cintiq with a Wacom pen.  On the Surface Book with this pen there is no difference between tilted and not-tilted running the same applications with the same brushes.  Thus it is useless regarding tilt for these applications.Microsoft provides sample UWP apps for developers that demonstrate various aspects of the Windows experience.  There is one SimpleInk that demonstrates how to implement a pen.  The app has several scenarios and  Scenario 12 demonstrates tilt.  To be sure it is the pen / Surface Book that is the problem I built and ran this one.  On my Cintiq with a Wacom Pen it does produce noticeably wider lines when tilted.  On my Surface Book with this Platinum pen there was no difference.  Thus using an app that is written by Microsoft as an example for developers there is no tilt.  I think this is definitive evidence that there is no tilt at least on my Surface Book.Based on Google research there is some evidence there are not 4096 levels of sensitivity either but I have not tested this myself.  This much sensitivity is not needed anyway (unless you can control your hand pressure to one part in 4096).  I am lucky to get much more than light medium and heavy myself.The cheaper replacements do not have Bluetooth. Bluetooth is not needed for the pen to work.  It works just fine with Bluetooth off.  However in that case you would not be able to go to OneNote for example with the button on the eraser end.  So you might want to pay for the Bluetooth functionality if your main purpose is using apps like OneNote.  It doesn't matter for the applications I use and mentioned above.After finding all this out I ordered a cheaper replacement with 1024 levels of sensitivity no tilt no magnet and no Bluetooth.  I one I got was “Surface Stylus Pen Digitizer 1024 Touch Pressure For Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Surface Pro 3 Surface 3 Surface Book New Surface Pro 2017 Surface Laptop StudioASUS Transformer 3 (Sliver)”.  It has an aluminum body and the look and feel of it is comparable to the Platinum pen plus it makes the same strokes in my applications.  For my purposes it is just a good as this Platinum pen at a fraction of the price.  It also has a clip which will be useful as I don't plan to use the magnetic strip any more.
5,Must have original Microsoft pen you can feel the difference.
5,Allow for accurate and writing.  Would recommend to anyone taking notes in their Surface.
5,I had one of the alternative surface pens (because $35-40 is a lot easier to swallow than $100 which I usually found these for) but they just don't compare.The button is full and natively supported on surface machines and can be bound to multiple functions. The pen is round with a single flat side (pictures sometimes make them look either round or hexagonal) and comfortable to hold and the feeling while writing is pretty natural. The other pens I had tried have hard tips and give a very clear 'plastic on screen' feeling the surface pens have a softer rubberized end (and functional eraser) which feels more like using a firm marker.It needs a AAAA battery for the bluetooth functions but it looks like it should last a few years each time so not really a concern.
5,Funciona muy bien!
5,I bought a cheaper version of the pen but it was really had to write with. With the microsoft pen I was able to rest my palm on the screen and have my other hand on the screen with no problem. This pen also detects downstrokes so it made doing lettering for the title of my notes really easy!
5,The Microsoft stylus is the next best thing after the Cintiq stylus.  It's responsive  accurate and awesome.  I've been drawing on the surface for 6 years now.  It's a great product.
4,This is NOT red. It is more orangish.
1,The top of the pen still works but the tip won't write. Both my pen and my surface pro 7 are only 3 months old so I don't think I should be having this much trouble.  I've done everything the Microsoft forums said to do to try to fix the problem so I think the pen must be the problem and not my computer.Quote from Microsoft Community"Thank you for reaching out to Microsoft Community.Surface Pen does not need to paired for it to ink/write.

5,The pen is working as expected. The only downside is that it can be a bit laggy when I'm drawing. However the research I've done tells me that it's normal. Overall I'm happy with the purchase.
3,It worked fine initially but later after a month it started malfunctioning. I can see the pointer but when I write it does not show up on the screen. Sometimes even the pointer does not come up on the screen to guide the writing.
5,It works well or my Samsung Alpha Flex2 and that's all I ask for.
5,It’s good pen that replaced an older revision that broke. Does what it supposed to do and more responsive than older pen.
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Was easy to use straight out of box. Works with the Microsoft Surface Pro 7 Plus so far. Highly disappointed in the color though. Would return it but not sure they would take it back or that other colors wouldn’t be equally misnamed. In the photos and on its box this pen looked like the red color that an actual poppy is or the red from the American flag. However the pen looks more like rust copper the “burnt orange” crayon or orange-red of cedar-stained folding chairs from the 1970s. That color needs to return to the 1970s to the place all things avocado green and harvest gold retired. Tech wise it is a very good stylus so far. I am NOT a fan of the color at all in case you wondered. Wish I hadn’t bought it but since I did and despise the color it will likely last for eternity. So there’s that as an good side!
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 My old pen was kinda broken a few weeks ago after being used for over 5 years so I trusted this brand a lot and decided to get this one as replacement. However it only works for around a week and now I have to return it and wait for several days for a new one.
1,I received the Microsoft Surface Pen in July of 2019.  I bought it for work as I am an Insurance Agent. I needed it so that my clients could use it to sign documents on my Surface Pro 6.  I always kept it in the box that it came in and only took it out when I needed to electronically sign something or when I needed to get a signature from a client.  As an $80 pen it's obviously the most that I have ever spent on something like that.  For it to stop working within the first 7 months of having it is surprising and absurd.  My colleagues that opted to go with non-Microsoft electronic pens have not had any issues with theirs and most of them have been using the same one (non-Microsoft pen) for 2+ years.  I loved how it looked and went with the whole sleek color scheme of my Surface Pro 6 and the silver type cover that I got to go along with it however it's extremely disappointing that it no longer works.  I have the Surface Pro 6 the matching silver type cover and I recently bought the Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 as well.  I am pleased with the other devices and enjoy using all of them.  The fact that the PEN of all things was the tool that that just STOPPED WORKING is simply baffling and frustrating to me.  It is supposed to go along with these specific devices.  After all it is the MICROSOFT SURFACE PEN!  Spending $80 on this pen frankly is not worth it.  I'm hoping that it was a simple malfunction with the exact pen that I just happened to get but I'm not willing to spend another $80.00 just to have it stop working again in 6 months.  I'm hoping that Amazon or Microsoft at the very least will attempt to remedy this situation for me.  I would love to feel the need to delete this review and find out that it must've just been a malfunction in the one that I got were I to get another shot at using this pen (Which I only use to help senior citizens enroll in supplemental & advantage plans for Medicare as well as Life Insurance); At which point I would be relieved to learn that these pens are actually reliable and replace this with a 5 Star Review….Just Disappointing..
3,The pen works well but I received a slate grey pen instead of the ice blue I ordered.
5,love it
4,This product DOES NOT include the original Microsoft surface pen packaging and box. it comes in a custom box and does not include any microsoft branding or such. also DOES NOT include replacement pen points! Great product but be aware of what you are buying!
2,I purchased this product to replace my old pen that I had lost. It worked great for 4 months and then the tip of the pen stopped working all together. I bought new tips for it thinking that was the issue but it still didn't work. I had my old pen for years and it never did this. I even tried to update all the software and did all the trouble shooting Microsoft recommended and nothing worked. This pen isn't worth it.
3,I got my first surface pen when I got my surface in 2018. About a year later the pen stopped working. I bought this one as a replacement and three months after I bought it the tip stopped working. It was still paired and it erased just fine but it couldn't draw anything basically rendering it useless. I had to deal with microsoft support for hours trying to get it fixed and they were absolutely useless. They have horrific customer service. And they don't tell you this when they offer to replace the tips but it's not covered under the 1 year warranty that comes with it. The warranty doesn't cover a device if anything goes wrong with it. I love the pen when it works but I need it to work and now it's broken and it's only been four months since I purchased. Do with this information what you will because I know other tech companies make products that crap out like this too.
5,Exactly what I was looking for. Paired just fine and works as advertised. I wasn't sure at first wasn't enough info about these and Surface Go 3.
2,Received the item today earlier then expected & unfortunately that is the LONE BRIGHT SPOT of the entire transaction.  Nowhere did the product page say anything about non-compatibility with the Surface GO.  In fact every place I looked stated it WAS compatible.  So I dove right in and decided to buy it.  The previous "Microsoft certified" pen I had purchased wasn't working so I decided it was time to just go the OEM route and be done with it.  When I received the pen today I read the directions and dove right in.  I ran into an issue right off the bat. You should be able to pair the pen by pressing it against the screen for approx. 10 - 15 Sec's.  When I attempted this it didn't work .  So I went the manual route to which the pen paired without incident.  EVERYTHING about the pen worked and functioned except for the fact it wouldn't write on anything or any app.  So I went to Microsoft and did some trouble shooting.  I went through numerous steps and then on a "accident" I saw this:  "Pen not compatible with the Surface Laptop Go"!  REFUND process initiated.Moral of the story:  Always do your research and verify info against more than one source this will prevent you from looking like an idiot like Me.
5,It works perfectly. Good sensitivity. A bit pricey but worth it.
2,Hi! I bought this pen Nov. 10th when I lost my original pen and it worked great! However last night it just decided to stop working. I thought the batteries were dead so I went to replace it with a brand-new battery and it still didn't do anything. Testing both batteries the eraser button works just fine but the tip isn't interacting with the screen.I've done everything to try to fix the issue. Restart my computer change batteries reboot the pen go into device manager none of it seems to work. Asking Microsoft for help was useless because they just told me to get a replacement.Because it's been less than a year can I get a replacement Surface Pen under the warranty? This issue is frustrating and I use the pen to draw and write practically every day for school.
3,Works fine and the package was factory sealed but I was sent the wrong pen. I don't have time to make a return.
5,I am enjoying my Microsoft Surface Pen my first good choice.
5,So many functions
4,Works fine except the clicking part. Clicks fine just does nothing......
5,it works
2,I haven’t even used this yet. I just opened it because my surface came in and this is what I found?! This is completely disgusting
1,lost my old one of these so I decided to get a new one - worked for maybe like an hour before it turned off. Decided to take the battery in/out + restart it and after a few minutes it would work again but then turned off again almost instantly. Decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and put a new battery in it (i had some replacement ready from my previous pen) and it worked again for maybe less than an hour and stopped working once again. Extremely frustrating!
1,This review is entirely for the product description. I can’t tell you anything about how the product actually works because turns out it does not work for my surface two laptop. The description should be more clear as to what models this product will work with and not require consumers to go into product specifications to determine if it will work for them. Quite ironic that something called a surface pen does not work with all surface models. Please revise the description to be more transparent. Worst part is I have to pay six dollars to return it so I lose out overall. Boo!
5,I bought this as an add on to the already eye-wateringly expensive surfacebook 15 and was fully prepared to send both back if they did not meet my expectations. I can say unequivocally that both devices exceeded my expectations. Inking is easy and smooth. I am not artist so I can't weigh in on the high levels of sensitivity but for a quick note jot it works well. But where this combination really shines for me is math notations. I went from dozens of printed pages and scrawled notes that I struggled to decipher after class to just plopping the surfacebook down and scanning class work into onenote and I was off to the races. It has changed the way I work in a profound way and I will never approach classes the same way after this. My only gripes are the inability to quickly swap ink and lasso modes with the hardware buttons in onenote but this is a very small qol rather than a real problem.
4,Much better than the first generation pin. Worth the upgrade.
2,Disappointed with the color. The ice blue is NOTHING like the image in the ad. It's more of a shade of gray. As you can see in the image I compared with a blue and silver mouse.
5,si levanto el lápiz a dos mm de la pantalla sigue escribiendo llegaron muy bien se sintió bien pero al poco tiempo comenzó con ese desajuste y nunca mas se recuperó
5,love it
2,The featured blue color in the photos for the item shows much darker almost cobalt blue. The ice blue pen is still a shade of blue but it looks more grey colored than anything.
5,Excelente!! Tal cual esperaba
1,I purchased this pen as a gift for the new school year.  Unfortunately the Surface laptop arrived after the return deadline so I was unable to test the pen before the return window closed.  The pen is definitely used (scratches on the buttons with a battery at 80%) not new as was advertised.  It is a silver/tan color not ice blue as advertised.  And most importantly it doesn’t work.  After several days troubleshooting it is still useless.  Extremely disappointed with the product and seller.
5,If you have a Surface the pen isn't necessary but it's great if you want to use something with a bit more finesse.I run a lot of GIS and CAD software on my Surface (doesn't always run well...but it'll run. Usually.) when out traveling.The pen input is excellent for digitizing features from scanned maps and other rasters. It's much quicker than a mouse for that purpose and (to me at least) feels a lot better than using my fingers on the touch screen.Also - if you use the pen you don't get fingerprints and smudges on the screen...which is kinda nice.
5,One may hesitate to buy a surface pen because of the limited use cases but it really taps on a different dimension in surface experience. One may use it to sign documents take notes or use it for drawing. The pen itself feels like an actual pen it connects seamlessly to the device and provides a smooth writing experience. When unused you can put it down on the surface type cover to prevent it from being lost.
2,I got one pen that didn't even work and had to send it back within 2 days. Received the replacement and it worked just long enough that I was unable to return it. Meh
3,It works as said but for some reason after a couple of months my surface is having trouble configuring to it. Not sure the reason. Don't know if it's the pen or the surface.
5,So far so good. Ordered a 2nd
5,I was happy to see this was a real Microsoft pen.  The price was great and the red is easy to find.  You need to be careful with these as the tips can break and need to be replaced.
1,The 1st pen lasted 10 days before the tip disintegrated and became non functional; the 2nd pen lasted one day before its tip disintegrated. Maybe the third pen will be the charm but based on the number of 1star feed backs reporting rapidly disintegrating tips I suspect a manufacturing defect/issue. All my pens were sold by Amazon so I don't think they were knock offs but something is definitely wrong with this product.
5,I love this pen for my Microsoft pro it is like the key to the castle and opens up a whole new world of use for your computer. I especially love the eraser on the back. The feature that is really convenient though is the button that acts as a right click it’s possible to accidentally click but still very easy to use.It fits comfortably in your hand kind of like some of my favorite pens just a little wider. Hand tires at the same rate if a bit slower as with a regular pen because you don’t have to press down hard at all.
5,First one I ordered had really bad hovering issues where it would continue drawing even if not pressing on the tablet. What I could find online about it chalked it up to a manufacturing error so I ordered a replacement. This second one works perfectly.
1,The stylist tip will stop working within a couple months 2 of my friends had the same experience. I bought a surface pen from Qmazon Walmart & Best Buy. They all randomly stopped working after a couple months. I don't have children that mess around with my stuff I never dropped my pen I was always very careful with it. I warned you!
4,I had bought an authentic silver pen from another Amazon store but it never worked correctly. It was very frustrating. I couldn't return it because it was passed the return date so I bought this red and it works perfectly. No problems so far.
5,I use it everyday like the ability to write
4,Pen works well but I received the wrong color. My pen is a light grey blue instead of the bright teal that was advertised. Slightly disappointed but not enough to send it back.
4,It’s a cool pen to use for the surface products. It’s has some issues on accuracy when writing but not too bad. I love it matches the surface keyboard. After a while you will definitely need to get replacement pen tips. The tip wears down over time.
5,This pen replaced a highly related knockoff bought off Amazon. That pen proved utterly useless worthless and effectively increased the cost of buying what I should have bought in the first place. The experience of using this pen is comparable to the Apple Pencil--what more need be said--and it is moderately magnetic enough to attach to the Surface tablet.  Being cheap up front can prove more expensive in the long run which I will never learn.
4,It's just not that necessary. 4 stars instead of 3 because it's more about me not liking it rather than it not working well or not working as-advertised. Its fun for a moment but to me a keyboard and a mouse is so much better. That's why I love the Microsoft Surface tablet because it's keyboard has a mouse unlike other tablets. Also it's use of a AAA battery is kind of a bummer but I guess that's better than a permanent battery going bad one day.
5,Bought this to go with my matching color surface pro 6 for college it works very nicely and smoothly. However I would highly recommend getting a screen protector for your device should you use this often I've found that even though the tip is smooth and soft it does leave from light marks nothing that can't be cleaned without a microfiber cloth so that's good.
3,Wanted a red pen. Got a copper pen. Boo!!!!
5,I opted to get the Microsoft Pen that would be easily compatible to my MIcrosoft Go instead of having to find a cheaper comparable one.  This one is magnetic color matches my MIcrosoft Go and writes well.  I just followed the directions included in the box to get started.  I'll probably keep a supply of AAAA batteries for it. Arrived within one day!! Love it!!
5,I tried two different cheaper off-brand pens for my surface where the reviews said they worked "just as good" as the Microsoft pen. Maybe if all you're doing is poking the screen but I use this thing to draw and none of the off brands actually had proper pressure sensitivity or made consistent lines.If you use your Surface for art this is the only pen that actually works in my experience.
1,Getting for 4 months now. My pen tips couldn't work but pen bottom still works well. I have tried rpair change the battery change pen tips deleter Marvell bluetooth etc. None of them help...Genueily asking for question to fix this problem.
4,Wanted a high power tablet and be able to edit Office documents. This works great for that.
4,I really like this pen especially for the standard batteries it uses.  While I'm not an artist or a professional who could take full advantage of this pen I'm more than pleased at all the functionality it provides the layperson.  to be honest I just learned how to pair it with bluetooth and was blown away by all the extra thing I can do other than just poke around with the pen.The reason for 4 stars is that I had to poke around to find out how to use the pen. It should have been in the documentation as to how to connect by bluetooth for the layperson.Cheers to Microsoft
3,I opened this pen and the first thing I thought was I have a counterfeit!!  It's not red.  It's nowhere near red. It's dirt clay orange.  I needed something that stands out on my black work surface. and red is my favorite color.  Orange is one of my LEAST favorite colors.I thought maybe it's my screen. I uploaded a picture of this pen and compared it to the one pictured here. Mine is orange and the one here is definitely red. Then I compared it to the pictures on the Microsoft website.  Same thing. Theirs is red. Mine is orange.So is mine a fake?  How do I find out?  I can't send it back because I needed it yesterday.
4,This pen is great. Honestly one of the best laptop pens on the market. The only one that surpasses this is the Apple Pencil. The reason I say that is because with the Apple Pencil you can shade stuff by turning the pen on it's side. That's if you're using it for art purposes. In a business/school setting this pen is perfect.
3,It worked great when I first got it though this is number three. I lost the first one and it worked for almost two years with no problem. Number two stopped working 6 months after I got it. This one was number three and it lasted two months. It apparently has a design flaw.  Microsoft is replacing it no questions asked though. Their customer service was really easy to use for once.
4,Built quality is premium. The tip feel a little bit untrusty but soft to pressure. Apple pencil is way better. I bought this to fully use my Surface Pro for design and art creations. When using it I feel the technology of the pen kinda oldfashioned it needs improvements. Maybe next year a new Surface pen will appear. By now I'm happy with this product it gets the job done.
5,I was worried when it came in that it was a knock off until i tried it out. The surface pro picked it up as a surface pen immediately and the response was exactly like my previous one. I'm happy with the purchase thank you!
5,I am happy with the pen as it is exactly what I had expected...very responsive not a problem when hand touches screen at the same time.  Need still to learn more about using it but with the application I used it worked excellent just like a real pen or brush or spray dose or crayon etc.  Great tool for an artistic inclined person. I am using it on the Surface Go smallest config and it works great!  ( I am a former Apple Marketing Director and I am spoiled when it comes to graphic tools! But I am impressed by the use of this pen!)
5,After 3 years of heavy duty use my surface's pen died. This pen is the latest model and I like that it works perfectly with my surface 4. I bough the red one because I have the red keyboard cover and they look amazing together. There where some functions that didn't work with my other pen and with this one all works perfect. The levels of sensitivity are also soooo much better.
3,I was very happy with this pen untill I touched the Apple Pencil (2nd gen). Then I realized that this pen is crap!1. It saddles you with the need to search for scarce AAAA batteries. Apple pencil is rechargeable wirelessly!2. Even with skinny AAAA batteries the pen is still fat. Apple Pencil is the size of...a Pencil!3. The nib is fragile and wears out fast! and official replacement costs a fortune-30$ and up. The Apple Pencil's nib is very durable and if it ever wears out spare nibs are cheap-10$4. The eraser thing is a useless feature. The Apple Pencil doesnt bother with such nonsense!The Apple pencil (1st and 2nd generation) are the better design especially the 2nd generation pencils.Now i'm looking to sell my surface pro and find money for the ipad pro 12.9 (3rd gen) just for that sweet 2nd generation Apple Pencil!
4,The pen arrived with a dead AAAA battery so I now have to make an additional purchase.Updated: After purchasing a new battery it seems as if the pen works great. Updated review from 2 to 4 stars.
4,It is the normal surface pen. I have cobalt blue that stopped working after a year and decided to get an icy blue pen. It’s literally grey slightly tinted blue. So I’m disappointed. I’m going to return it and get a cobalt blue...
5,If you’re going to get a surface pro then you need the surface pen. It makes using the touch screen so much easier and more accurate.
4,I love love love my Surface Pro. I had an iPad Pro and it just wasn't as good as the Surface Pro...except for the pen. I wish this one felt as natural as Apple's did. I wish it worked quite as seamlessly as Apple's does. If I never tried the Apple pen then I doubt I would feel this way. The Surface pen is great. It just isn't the best one out there.
2,This product works great initially.  Then dies after the return period ends.  I purchased three of them.  Never again.Microsoft delivers a subpar product.
4,I’ve used other surface pen models and this by far works the best! Always use brand to brand products as I’ve found that off brand items don’t work for me and especially when I need them the most!
5,Product arrived and has exceeded my expectations. First time MS Surface user here. Works with Surface Go 2.
3,Not the best. The surface pen i use to have with the bettery i think it's the older generation was so much better. It seriously can not draw a straight line. Never had a problem with my older generation surface pen. I'm so sad about it. Should not have paid that much if i knew this was going to be an issue.
5,It works just as expected was able to easily connect to the surface and no issues so far.
5,Works great with Microsoft Surface Pro 7. Writes smoothly.
5,Looks and works just like the original that came with my Surface. $80 for a stylus seems high to me but I don’t have any confidence in the quality of aftermarket electronics.
4,A fine and stylish product does everthing that it says... I use it on the new Surface Pro and it's a very good companion to it. Handwriting is amazing latency is nearly zero. Feels like a real penThough the experience of navigating and using it to interact in Windows 10 is not that amazing. I remember I had a better experience with stylus on my previous Samsung Note 3 in 2013.. That's why 4 stars :) Rather than that all is ok.Note: Use toolbae creator and will enhance your way of using the pen on Windows...
5,This product was purchased as a gift for my daughter. I watched her use it as she edited the imperfections of one of my art pieces making it a sharper image. It was amazing to watch.
5,I lost my pen and tried replacing it with a generic one for half the price. Wrong answer. It didn't work right and did not have nearly the functionality that this one does. This name brand product works better with my Surface Pro and it feels better in the hand.
4,Found a nearly perfect size clip (good grip on pen) on an old tire pressure gauge.  The kind that has the long measuring stick that gets pushed out by the air pressure.  I like the pen very much other than the clip issue and although I can't give precise answers as to why it is definitely better than the original pen that came with the Surface Pro.
4,Works perfectly with Surface Pro 6.Extremely happy with comfort sensitivity design.(Would have been 5 stars but they sent wrong color and I didn't have time to work through an exchange)
5,El producto excelente todo ok.Pero tengo otro problema relacionado con este envío que Amazon no soluciona por qué me indican que no son ventas directas de ellos pero a la vez si son ofrecidas bajo su forma de venta “Renewed” (además enviada por ellos) lo cual te da confianza a comprarlo.
5,Gracias.  Me llegó antes del tiempo prometido bien empacado manejado como debe ser en el proceso de importanción.
1,I've gotten two of these pens already. The first one the tip stopped working after a week. I replaced the tip tried a new battery even tried it on another surface laptop and it still wouldn't work. So I had that one replaced. Now I'm on my second one and it's taken a few months but it finally did the same thing as the first pen. It's just given out. The tip no longer works replacing it does nothing. The eraser works just fine so it's clearly not a battery issue but now I don't have a working pen to draw with. Again.This time though I can't replace the item through Amazon because it's been a few months now and the Microsoft Support Site refuses to let me even attempt to replace it.For how much I paid for this thing it really hasn't been worth it.The pen when it works is awesome but I've had two fail on me the same way now.
2,I used this on my surface go worked great the first few months I barely used it and took great care of it. As soon as the tip broke off 6 months later the pen stopped connecting as well. Not only that but there is no way to replace the battery unless they glued the dang pen shut… wish I’d just spent the extra $50 on getting the real thing but I didn’t expect this one to crap out so early especially for the price.
5,I love this pen. Allows me to sign forms electronically and fill out diagrams during Zoom calls. Great addition to the surface. Son uses it for class. Sensitivity is 90%.
4,Great pen but expensive for what it is. My old one lasted just long enough to outlast the warranty. I hope this one last longer!I have tried other pens but this one does work the best on my surface book2.
5,Pen works great easy to use and handle .
5,Not much to tell here - good strong magnet holds well. Just be aware that it does not have a pocket clip like the one I lost. It's good in that it's just one less thing to snag something and get ripped off the side of the tablet. It's bad in that if you want to take it off and pocket it for safe keeping in a crowded situation there's no pocket clip. Goods and bads - just so you know...
4,I got this for my brand new Surface Go.  Glad I got it.  I find it good to use. Have no prior stylus experience to compare to.  Though finding the marks skips a bit if I tilt it too much.  Though it sticks to the side (magnetic) of the screen I find that I easily knock it off by accident.  Wishing that magnet is stronger.
5,I have a couple of Surface Pro4 tablets that the kids use for school and they lost both Original pens.  The new pen seems to be more accurate/ sensitive.
5,What’s even better the old pen required two different batteries. This only one. A common one.
4,Nothing special and not precise enough for editing or detailed drawing which I had hoped for. Too chunky
5,Easy to use! Exactly what I needed from Microsoft
1,I bought a replacement pen because my previous "ice blue" pen suddenly stopped working on my surface pro after less than 50 hours of use and Microsoft Customer Service told me the only solution was to purchase a new one. They couldn't be bothered to send the correct color for the one I ordered and sent a silver one instead. Plus I used it for 4 hours one day and then for my 3 hour work session today it suddenly stopped writing just like the first pen I purchased did. It is a Sunday so I can't get any tech support assistance but I tried the same tricks they did for my last pen and it didn't suddenly start working so I don't think they are building these pens to last at all.
4,Love it
5,Works perfectly as expected. Magnetize to. Y computer really well. Very comfortable to grip and has nice shortcuts by using the buttons.
4,was a xmas gift
5,Everything you expect from a Surface Pen but in Ice Blue.
5,Muy práctico para usar ayuda mucho para realizar trabajos
5,Yes I know at one point these came with the surface devices however i am not entirely to mad at the fact that I have to buy it now in that it adds more features than the other pen that came with older surface devices. I believe that this newer pen comes with 4096 levels of pressure lower latency and tilt support. All in all the product feels durable and it clings on to the side of my Surface Book 2 so I do not think that I'll lose it anytime soon
2,Stopped working.  Researched tips and tricks and followed all credible advice.  Replaced battery replaced tips rebooted and re connected thru Bluetooth.  Still doesn't work.  About as reliable as Apple garbage.
5,Love the way it Wrights so smooth
5,This is a really ha du keyboard. It takes a bit of getting used to recluse it is a small form keyboard but it is pretty accurate with the right amount of travel.I love the fact I do t need to charge it and it folds to create a really nice bit of protection for the screen. Overall you barely notice any increase I total width for the tablet and keyboard.
4,Does exactly what my old pen did but has a very different feel in texture. Its not as smooth which I kind of miss but for the price its good.
5,I bought a third party one which was ok but to me it seemed like it lagged from when you wrote or drew with it to the response on the screen. That’s why I opted to get the original one plus the eraser works like it’s meant to along with the clicker on the side. I’m Glad I bought it.
1,The product came in an unsealed box and pen was not wrapped in a sealed plastic they normally are when purchased new. Not sure if the item was not new but either way it didn’t work. The pen connected to our surface pro 7 and all the button shortcuts worked it but did not actually write/was not recognized by the touchscreen. We also tried it on a surface laptop 4 and had the same issue. Will be returning item. We also just purchased the same pen directly from Microsoft and it worked right out of the box so it wasn’t a compatibility issue.
4,Love my pen.  It just work.  Touch screen works very well.comfort is good and it's easy to use.  Happy I bought this one.
5,Easy to use and works great on the touch screen. Very accurate.
5,It's very responsive.
4,Works well doesn’t attach to the surface pro 3 correctly and since there’s no clip on this version you can’t attach it to the type cover like the old ones. I got mine with the office 365 combo so it’s something I can livewith. I might Design something to starch it some other way.
4,The pen itself is really good in my opinion. I feel as if I'm writing with a real ink pen. I do have a small complaint that sometimes it will glitch out and make a sharp line up when I did not intend for it to happen. Also it does feel a little heavy in the hands but at that point I'm just nitpicking. overall a very good pen but I believe a little over priced.
3,Ice blue is a blue/silver. Cobalt blue is pictured on the description thumbnail. Pen works great though.
5,Works just fine with my Surface laptop.  Works as advertised.  It's somewhat awkward to use with the Surface laptop but it's not the fault of the pen.  It's the fault of the laptop because the screen monitor won't lay flat and is always connected to the keyboard.
4,The Bluetooth functionality doesn't add too much for me and I ended up turning it off so I could click the top for fun. I end up with a great pointer that's too expensive for what I use it for. Still would heavily recommend it for surface users
1,I have had one now for almost 5 years. For some reason the new pens just will not work for long. It worked out of the box for a day or so then stops working. I did everything I was told to do and it would not work. I do not understand why but after buying direct with Microsoft also I find the new pens like this are not made as well as the one I still have all these years. Working or a nonworking pen is easy to make a comparison. I prefer it to work.
5,I love my pen great quality! Just not really blue. It's more grey.
3,After only about a month of using it as a replacement the tip stop interacting with the screen but the eraser end still interacted with the screen. I don’t mistreat my things so i know it’s not because of anything i did. I paid way too much much for bullcrap like this to happen.
5,Love how easy it was to set up and use.
5,I’ve been using this pen with my surface pro 6. It is extremely smooth to use and easy to understand. I’ve been using it for a couple of months now and haven’t had to replace the tip or the batteries so far. Overall it’s a perfect companion for the tablet.
2,I ordered a surface pen in ice blue about 40 days ago.  It arrived in silver but the color is trivial so I just kept and used it.  It's been a vital tool as I've taught through October and when it works right it's great. However it's started showing some issues.  The pen when writing sometimes gets very shaky making everything ineligble.  The batteries have needed to be replaced twice already.  Finally the eraser end where you would place the battery that doesn't stay closed tight on its own -this results in disconnects and a stylish ring of duct tape to hold it closed.It's a necessary tool at work but a little over a month of use and it's unfortunately falling apart.
5,Good quality product thanks for the fast shipping
4,After two different Surface Pro (both the 4gb and 8gb) I realized that the writing aspect which is what originally pushed me to buy was not the best designed feature. There is a lag when writing I don't know if it's the pen or the computer but it makes for a difficult note taking process. The pen is well designed and i am sure that they will eventually get it right.
5,Works great and makes it easier to perform certain functions with the Surface Pro handy when working with art/photos. The only downside it that I suffer from a neurological condition that makes my hands shake when holding things and sometimes it's difficult to select what I want to do. Wish they would create a setting that could be adjusted for people with unsteady hands.
5,I’ve been using the pen for six months now. It makes the Microsoft Surface Pro easy and intuitive to use. Draw freehand with it or it works like a mouse. Using it for AutoCAD Visio or PowerPoint is easier than using a mouse at a desktop.The tip bent and eventually broke after a couple of drops but replacement tips are inexpensive.
3,No he podido cuadrar para que no haga líneas y trazos involuntarias mientras lo tengo cerca de la pantalla sin tocarla. No se si es problema del pen o de la surface go 2
3,I recently bought this pen to replace the off-brand version I used previously. It definitely has more pressure sensitivity and works well with my Surface Pro 7. Is it worth the extra $50 though?I personally don’t think so especially because they sent me the wrong color. If you get the right color and don’t mind paying extra for the integrated use then go for it.
5,Bought for grandson to go with his computer
2,Before I brought it I read about all the things this pen does but when I tried yo connect  it ot didn't connect to my surface which was a huge disappointment. I would never recommend it.
5,Replaced a old one that lasted about 4 years.  The old one finally gave out as it had most likely been dropped one too many time.  Looks and feels like original.  Operates with tablet like the original.
5,This writes so well and feels good when writing on the surface
5,I tried several pens for my Surface Go this is the only one that was responsive sensitive and accurate. If you're an artist and want to use your Surface as a portable sketch pad don't bother with any of the generic pens; spend the extra money and get the one from Microsoft.
5,I couldn't be happier with the the surface pen. The only tweak I would make is to the button towards the tip. It sits flush which is nice but it can be hard to press sometimes.Other wise it works flawlessly and has exceeded my expectations.
4,Met my expectations the pressure sensitivity is really good.Cons:-tends to rotate in your hand while talking notes just wish it was slightly larger diameter or had a slight grip texture to it.-annoying and difficult at first to right hand click with it(using the side button)-gray tip can be hard to distinguish from the screen at times (making precise writing/touch-ups difficult)
4,I put off replacing my lost pen for too long hoping it would turn up. It hasn't. I'm very happy to have this replacement. I went for a more pricy one and haven't been disappointed. Works just the same and  synced right up.
3,The pen is wonderful the pen is 5/5 stars. It feels good in the hand it has a flat edge to prevent rolling away (cough Apple Pencil series one cough) and it does indeed magnetically stick to the side of my Surface Go.But I didn’t get the color I ordered. Still gonna keep it though.
5,The pen is not blue it is silver. It works fine.
2,I ordered the ice blue pen and got the platinum. Luckily it works fine with my surface tablet but after reading other reviews it seems like this is not the first time this has happened.
1,I am having the same problem many others are having with this pen. After only 2 months into the school year (I've had the pen and pro only 3 months) the pen tip is just suddenly no longer writing. I can still click the top of the pen but that's useless when I can even use the whiteboard that opens.I have checked for device updates restarted my device taken the battery out of my pen and replaced it unpaired and repaired the pen and uninstalled the driver and reinstalled and restarted again- NOTHING has worked- everything Microsoft support is recommending. Extremely disappointed that I splurged on the 'real deal' for this to happen and still received a faulty item. I do not recommend the gamble with this product.This is how I take notes in medical school and classes don't stop because I can no longer take anatomy notes. So so frustrating.
5,I have owned a few Surface pens and this has so far been the best one yet. Its worth the extra money for the Microsoft model than the cheaper models. The sensitivity is superior to off brand pens. The eraser is very handy when taking notes. The side buttons do come in handy often. Easy to customize the button clicks to open specific apps or preform a certain function.
5,Had an off brand at first the R520 but this is noticeably better. If you want to draw get the real surface pen. For notes/writing pff brand is fine.
5,Receive it on excellent condition and easy to use this pen
4,Could have been better. Touch isn’t very sensitive at times
5,Great price for this new Surface Pro Pen. It is the newer model with the nice more accurate tip. Came new. Magnets works as they should on this pen as I place it on the different spots on my new Pro 6. I save a lot of money too buying from Amazon and next day shipping was awesome!  I would definitely recommend this pen and from the seller.
5,Excelente inversión. El lápiz funciona como el apuntador en pantalla. Imagen clara y nítida al realizarla con este dispositivo que es acúlame té reconocido en la Surface Pro. Excelente calidad!
5,It works great and is as advertised. I was skeptical because it’s about $30 cheaper than if I were to buy it in the store. However it is the surface pen. I got the ice blue model # Euy00049.
3,if you're an artist this pen will drive you crazy unless you draw fast enough other than that its a nice pen feels great works great and seems durable enough I just hope they fix the jitter causing these awful lines when trying to draw slowly or precisely
4,I got a used one and it came with a dead battery so I had to buy AAAA batteries
5,I promise you you will not regret forking out the extra money for this authentic Microsoft surface pen. It has so many features! The $25-$40 pens do not compare to this pen and its accuracy. It makes using your surface as a tablet so much easier.
5,I got this pen as a replacement for the original ( I lost it). It arrived fast! So far I'm happy with this pen. I'm using it with a Pro 3 and works great!
5,My third one in 6 years (older models) - each generation gets better.  I love the "double-click" to snapshot anything on the screen and then you can write underline and highlight.  Anything. I have used it in meetings to jot notes and then it syncs with my One Drive and the notes are available anywhere even my Android phone.  It's a great pen LOVE that the "eraser" erases.  I have created dress designs edited documents it's such a versatile tool.
5,Love the sensitivity  tilt and programmable buttons.It's well made and easy to use.I doubt you'll find a better pen for Surface Pro.Tip provided has just the right amount of drag on a glass screen.Hopefully more apps will take advantage of all of it's features.Really should be included with the Surface Pro I debated getting a cheaper alternative but I'm glad I got this one now.
1,Loved the pen for 2 months. Then it stopped writing. The buttons could still open apps but couldn't write point nothing. A quick Google search of troubleshooting says to: try rebooting pen; try restarting tablet; try updating; check drivers; and so on. So I did all 8 options. At the end of all the articles there is a comment section where people say it just keeps happening and you need to return the pen for a free replacement. Not sure I'm interested in all that. My $10 knock-off pen has worked for a year so maybe I'll just stick with that.
3,Color is not blue. This pen looks more silver than blue.  Picture shows a blue color but it is more grey than blue. If you want a grey pin I would pay less and order the silver one.
5,Worked like a charm right out of the box. OEM.
3,I have bought this pen twice and both times it works well for a couple months or so. After some time of use the black plastic casing over the tip of the pen stylus breaks off and the pen will no longer register with the Surface screen. If such a small piece of plastic is so essential to the pen's function it should be more hardy and definitely last longer! Definitely not worth buying over and over again.
5,Great so far. Color is not as prominent of a blue as I hoped. Microsoft's pictures are misleading on how dark the color is.
5,Excelente lapiz vendedor rápido en el envío recomendado
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Is a nice accessory for your Surface and even started drawing something with that one and is really nice. I do not like that needs a strange AAAA battery for power. Why cannot be rechargeable? Worth the price? Maybe not currently is $65 but initial price is $99. Weight is 21 grams (0.75 oz) and length is about 5.75”
5,Love the color hard to lose
4,Significant improvement over the surface pro 3 pen.Pros Writing with it feels responsive and the pen tip grips on the display well.Latency has dropped significantly.Cons:still not rechargeableAAAA batteries are difficult to find outside of the US and maybe Europethey removed the clip on the top part of the pen
4,Works as advertised. Not sure about the "bang for your buck" though. Seventy dollars is a lot of money for a beefed up stylus. All-in-all not unhappy with the purchase.
5,works like a dream
1,Pen is so overpriced. You do not get anything extra or special for that price either. There are better cheaper options than this.
5,Has been working great since receiving it.  I currently own the new surface pro.  Best tablet pen for writing I have used so far although I have only used the cheaper bamboo pens.  It snaps onto the side firmly so I can take both (surface pro and surface pro pen) together as one which I was impressed with.  Recommend if your looking for a pen to go along with your surface pro.
3,Overall the pen is great. The look and feel is premium and the magnet makes it easy to store on the side. However my only grip is with the seller. My pen came with a battery of 4%. Thus having me to go on a wild hunt for some AAAA batteries. Best Buy is a great place that has them.
3,but then it stopped working after about six months later.  Just had to buy a new one from Best Buy because I couldn't wait for one to be delivered.
5,This pen works great. If you are using Clip Studio then that is probably the best program to use on a surface pro with this pen. You can use the pen to draw while using your fingers to zoom rotate and move the canvas.All in all this was a great value for my money. I highly recommend this product
5,I love it. It's going to make note taking in school a hell of a lot easier. I'm a college student and I am constantly having to take notes. Typing and writing in a book is to much of a jugle. This should be a lot more easy. Will get back to you in a week for an update.
3,The way it feels when you write on surface pro it feels really nice to touch.I don't think the pen itself has problem but whenever I use the pen it(the lines) will break and become really messy.It might not seem like a big problem but it's quite frustrating when you have to constantly repeat erase-write process over and over.If you're just using it to make short notes highlight and stuff it's alright but if you're planning on using it to make class notes etc I recommend youto consider other products too before you choose to use surface pro.
5,Provides top-notch writing experience in my 2017 Surface Pro. Little or no lag writing in most applications especially those that follow the UWP model (shoutout to OneNote). Ssome old applications like Adobe Acrobat have still work to do on their pen support. but it works and makes for a nice writing experience and better work.
5,The pen arrived without a box but it was okay. There is a small black dot on the side of the pen which is not very visible but the pen works perfectly. It also has a battery included with 76% charge.
3,Pros: Great ergonomics noticeable improvement in latency vs. previous pen fits well aesthetically with the rest of the Surface products.Cons: My biggest issue is the stiffness of the pen tip. I have the previous pen and this new one definitely has a tip that is flimsy in comparison. I returned my first purchase because of this issue and on the advice of Microsoft who thought that it was defective but my replacement also has a loose tip.Conclusion: Would be a better product if the manufacturing tolerance by MS is improved and the pen tip stiffened for better stability while writing.
5,The media could not be loaded.
2,This pen was very expensive to only last 10 months.  I tried all of the trouble shooting I could find but it just stopped writing.
4,Okey
2,The gray pen is what came with my surface laptop so I wanted something better looking with style When I received the item it started out great connected with my Microsoft surface book no problem but after a week it kept disconnecting and then two or three days later my surface book couldn't even find it took it to the Microsoft store and I was told it is not an authentic Microsoft pen and you can tell a major difference between the one that they sell at the Microsoft store in the one that is being sold on Amazon the blue color is not even the same
3,No sirve con la laptop surface go
5,easy to use
4,It is a bit pricey but performs great.
5,Easy to use and durable
5,ease of use with it
1,Does not work
3,I dislike the too keeps popping off. Needs to be more secure for the battery it takes
1,Bought this pen on Feb 27 2022 and it stopped working on April 2 2022. Did as much troubleshooting as possible but ultimately the pen is just garbage and is designed to stop working. I really liked the pen too. If only Microsoft cared about their products or customers. I ordered a knock-off instead of replacing it with another Microsoft dud.
3,I ordered this 2/20/19 only use it occasionally and it is 4/30/20 and it is only working 50% of the time.  I have replaced batteries.  I guess 14 months is it's life span?  Seems a little short for the price.
5,Buena calidad
5,Does it’s job and works well.
5,It was a great investment and way cheaper than in the Microsoft store.my daughter loves the pen and is able to draw with it without any delay in response from her surface pro. I had no problem attaching it to the surface pro.  Worth every penny!!!
5,Oh I love it. It is so accurate. I use it to take notes and it is awesome for that purpose.I didn't have problem with tips yet.
3,It is just expensive and it does not have a great difference from cheap one.
5,Had to tweak and acclimate myself w/ the new sensitivity which didn't take me too long. Definitely a fine tool/upgrade for my OG Surface Book.
5,Great improvement over my original pen for my Surface Book. The new pen feels more akin to writing on paper than on a glass screen. The increased sensitivity of the pen has been great when working with the various art and Adobe applications. Would definitely recommend for anyone looking to improve the writing or drawing experience on their Surface product. Patiently waiting for the added ability for drawing with the side of the nib.
5,Works great and was purchased for my Surface Pro ( not a replacement). first time buyer of this pen
5,Works great like it's supposed to and is 10 dollars cheaper than the one they sell on Microsoft website.
5,If you own any Surface device you should have one of these. Despite the nib breaking a bit this thing has been my favourite stylus to use in the history of stylus usage. Thanks to the damaged nib I ended up getting an inexpensive nib kit and I'm excited to see how they affect my drawings.
5,Perfact
2,Worked Great   Was still figuring it out before the eraser snapped offf and rendered the pen useless.  I noticed the eraser was very slightly bent and very carefully tried to bend it back in place and it snapped/broke off. Immprobably going to rrplace it with a less expensive  2nd party pen. Since they dont sell replacement partrs. For a broken eraser.
5,I use the pen all the time to it is one of my favorite Surface Accessories. I love taking notes with the pen over trying to type and the eraser on the other end is just so natural to use. The numerous levels of pressure sensitivity is also amazing.
5,Good pen just too pricey.
5,works great!
5,Works great
5,I didn't realize how far stylus pens have come until I used this.  I wish I were an artist so I had more of a chance to use it.  Also the way it automatically attaches and aligns itself to the surface pro helps to avoid losing it especially when you don't have much workspace (like on an airplane) available.
5,Bought this for school. It seamlessly integrated with my Surface Pro 6 and I have has zero issues with it.
5,Great product! the eraser function is awesome.
5,El producto llegó en el tiempo estimado y funciona correctamente cumpliendo todas las especificaciones de microsoft.
5,Handwriting is much more accurate with less latency.. money well spent!
5,Love it. Makes my Surface Go much easier to use. Really enjoy using the buttons to bring up coloring with my 4 year old and opening sticky notes so I can take quick notes while on a work call.
4,Pen scratch my surfaces heavyweight not energy efficient quick loss battery percentage
5,I got a Surface Pro and knew I'd be needing the Surface Pen since the primary reason for having gotten the Surface Pro was note-taking.  It's a surprisingly good laptop and a fairly good tablet.  The pen works a treat though it could be a bit more comfortable.
5,I have a Surface Book 2 so it's very convenient that the pens sticks magnetically to the side of the screen. Overall it works as intended. Definitely a bit pricey for just a stylus pen though.
5,Love it
5,Todo bien
5,It’s so comfortable to use
3,Works as expected however I have managed to loose it which is going to out me on my ugh 7th replacement pen. C'mon Microsoft put a locator on your pens!! I'm going to stick with the previous model because it has a clip which I use a lot and this one didn't have the clip. And I'm going to attach a Chipolo or Lapa to my next one going on spending like $500.00 on replacement pens is annoying as you know what.
5,it works nicely
5,This was part of a gift for my daughter.  It came when promised and it works well with her surface tablet.
5,Bought it as a present for someone who has the microsoft tablet. No complaints & works great!
3,All okay but came with a battery that was not working .. :(
5,I bought  it for someone else
5,Works as advertised
5,I originally purchased the surface pen from Bamboo which promised all of the same features as the Microsoft version. That was a mistake. The Microsoft pen is far better in writing feel accuracy and the ability to stick via magnet to the side of my Surface Book Pro. Worth the extra money over generics to get this right.
1,90% of the time the pen tip doesn't work but the eraser end does. After much research this seems to be a very common issue with the pen. Even after trying the remediation steps multiple times the writing part of the pen still does not work. For the price of the pen (and being tailored specifically to the Surface) I am overall disappointed with the product.
5,Why not get the surface pen when you purchase the surface tablet.  Some things will just work and shouldn't be left up to a 3rd party.  Complemented with keyboard/cover.  Very happy!
4,Stylus has a little weight to it but not heavy  and pretty nice to use.
5,Love my pen! Excellent palm rejection and 'eraser' feature. Surface apps integrated into pen top button means tablet + pen = fully featured must-have device. Enjoy my Surface even more now!
5,Make sure you follow the directions to make sure your pen is fully functioning and with accuracy.  Absolutely Love It!
5,Price not cheap.Came supplied with one AAAA battery.  Thanks.
4,They are very costly but the users insisted on these. They are quite nice just wish you didn't have to pay for Microsoft's name on them!
5,Thank you. It was everything I had hope for and more.
5,Its with a little doub i bought this. Always have been dissapointed in the past. Just got it yesterday and wow! Its like to use a real pen! No latency ! I love! Really recommend :)
5,Great addition to my Microsoft Surface Book 2 13.5" (Intel Core i7 16GB RAM 1 TB). I have used it more than I thought I would.
5,I first tryed a "generic" one. It was a terrible experience.Then I got the Microsoft's Surface pen!!!! Its a HUGE difference. Now I have a real pen&paper experience. Or even better...
2,It does not work properly with iphone
5,DOESN'T come with battery.  Make sure you order one!
5,I bought this for my Surface Go a few months ago and it works so well! You need AAAA batteries in it which last a long time. So smooth!
1,Didn't work. Tried troubleshooting and updating - just won't write.
1,Eraser button was functional as did tracking on the eraser end but tip did not work or track for whatever reason. Replacement had the same issue. Have another Surface-compatible stylus that works completely fine.On top of that was sent wrong color both initially and for the replacement.
1,Surface pen worked great while it lasted. Smooth writing and good response. Only lasted about a month until suddenly it stopped responding. I restarted it (hold down the eraser for 10 sec) reconnected it numerous times and tried reinstalling drivers and updating Windows. Now I'm out 70 bucks and no returns possible.
5,Lost my Surface pen months ago and suffered along without it as I was reluctant to replace at such a cost -- but this works well and I am happy!
1,This broke within the warranty I attempted to file for an exchange within the warranty period through Microsoft and was given the run-around by the agent responsible for handling my claim who said she was sending me a shipping label but it never arrived and when I brought this to the agent's attention they told me to refile a claim but it is too late now the pen is out of warranty and literal garbage. Absolutely awful product and worse customer service.
1,I had to replace the item once already and now it is not working again. Microsoft support is no help. Seems to be an issue that's lots of people have had as soon with no solution.
4,the experience i get during using it is awesome  very responsive and accurate
5,It works even better than a mouse or the touchscreen in my opinion. You have press and hold as well as right clicks that you can do with the pen.
5,This pen is so amazing. I am a teacher and I use all the features to draw illustrations on my Surface Book 2 and project the screen. The functionality comfort and response is off the charts good.
5,Didn’t think I would like this as much as I do. I read a lot in my Surface Pro fro work and grad school and the surface pen has been a cane changer for me.
5,Absolutely the best electronic pen I have ever used. It feels like a normal pencil/pen but I can take notes at full speed in class on my Surface Pro. I value this over the Apple pen. The erase function and programmable buttons make everything much more convenient.
4,I'm no artist but this is a nice addition to the Surface Book 2 or any device which uses the pen.
5,So i ordered this pen for my surface pro 6 and it came exactly as advertised in perfect condition working great really glad i purchased this pen from here ^_^
5,Seems to be the feel of pencil.  Haven’t yet put to the test of it’s full potential
1,I'm using it to ship back to Amazon since Surface Pen *officially* doesn't pair with my "compatible" Surface Duo.Clown world.
5,The Surface Pen was easy to setup and configure with my Surface Pro.  Within seconds of connection I was able to start writing notes control the OS with the pen.  This is a must have for any Surface Pro user.
4,Good pen had problems with Bluetooth but otherwise fine
5,I have tried Surface pens that are not Microsoft and it just isn’t the same. This one is great.
4,I like the feel and weight
5,It's Perfect! I LOVE Amazon Rock On Baby! ;o) writes and draws great! No issues! I have the Surface 2 Laptop and the pen goes fab with it! It can attach to the laptop as well when your not using the pen.
5,This surface pen works great and is comfortable to write with. It was a great upgrade from my previous pen I was working with. I am currently using it on my Hp spectre 360
4,This on works great. It's only "flaw" is that is feels a bit cheap
4,This product is absolutely great!
5,The generic pens I tried didn't perform nearly as well as this one definitely spend the extra for this one it will not disappoint.
5,I love being able to touch the screen with the pen.
5,I liked my Surface until I got this pen...now I LOVE my Surface. Easy to use gives the best option for using Surface in class for lectures and demos and for annotating documents. GET IT!
5,I love being able to write and draw on my laptop. I mostly use it for school. I highlight and take notes with the pen. It saves paper and increases creativity.
3,The pen wrights smoothly and the eraser works very well when needed. However I have had two of the new style pens and they just stop working in less than a year. the pen will pair but no on-screen functions are possible.
5,I’m using the surface pro and pen mostly for digital art and it feels great best system I’ve used!! Feels like a real pen to paper! (there is a bit of a learning curve it’s barely noticesable after an hr or so)
5,This really is better than oreviois versions.  I see fewer "waviness" in lines and get a better sketching feel to designs.  Also doing line to line designs also cleaner.I am comparing to earlier version of Surface 4 pens (have 2) plus Surface 3 pen.
5,good
4,there was a misunderstanding. I knew it was a new product. However the product name needs to be marked.
3,Works as designed a little pricey
5,Have to be honest...I was skeptical.I use it all the time to take notes or make edits to design projects. Absolutely enjoy using it and definitely recommend for anyone who does creative work.
4,I like it 100% because it has a good feel on the screen .
5,I absolutely love it
5,This item is great! Purchased a Surface Pro but the retail didnt have the pen in stock. Great response when using photoshop. Being able to magnetically attach the pen to the side of the surface is very convenient. Great purchase!
3,I know this is not the seller's falter but the pen is fragile and the tip broken within a falling.
4,Very good feel very pleasant to draw and erase.  Wish it was battery-less.
5,AMAZING PEN YAY! It's great had to get used to the rubbery feel on the screen but now it's very nice. I use it to create digital illustrations. Haven't had any issues and I've had it for two months.
5,I needed it for my surface and it works well no problems. Pen gets dirty easy to clean it off. Sensitivity is fine and can be changed on the tablet. Very good.
1,if this is the level of quality Microsoft is putting into their pens maybe they should just quit.my pen was purchased march 22 and spend almost 2 weeks in its box before I purchased my surface. its been on my surface or otherwise protected for 5 months and in the last 11 days it has stopped working. I've tried every option that exists from their lackluster online service. don't bother buying the pen here on amazon. maybe they save the better quality ones for their online store
1,Would highly recommend making sure your device pairs with this before purchasing. Don’t be a dummy like me
5,Works well more concise than the usual large rubbery tipped stylus.  Has buttons to aid in various functions (though being a quadriplegic I can't press them oh well 😉)Fits well in my stylus holder and allows me to write very fine with less mistakes.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 My one click works but not the tip. I read this in the reviews thinking it was a glitch in their pen but I too am experiencing this. Unfortunately I can't return it because my 30 days have passed. I only used it for about 3 weeks. You've been warned.
5,The Surface Pen Poppy Red is charming when used and it works perfectly.
3,Pros:-Recognized by surface-Came ready to use-still functional after 2 weeksCons:-tip is already broken-sometimes the screen reacts incorrectly and lines get wavy or suddenly appear on another part of the screen-sometimes you click the screen and it doesn't do anything-expensive for what it is
5,GREAT
4,Works fine but if you don't plan to use it a lot it's a pretty pricey gadget.
5,The first version of the Surface pen was good the second was better and this newest version is great. Easy to connect and use. No complaints at all.
5,(Don't mind the scratches on my screen I was just testing the pen) Nice grip and feels nice. Perfect although I should've bought the burgundy
5,Wow
5,Great product for editing drawing and in some cases writing. Very pricey however a well working product that lives up to its product description.
5,excellent
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 It works really well on my Surface Laptop 2 and is easy to set up
5,New to MS Surface and associated ancillary hardware; but pleasantly impressed with functionality demonstrated.
5,Nice pen easy to program works great with Microsoft laptops
5,I use this along with my 2017 surface pro for college classes and I gotta say it’s nice. Taking notes and marking up pdf’s have been a breeze for me.
5,Works super well on my Microsoft Surface Go! I use it when I take notes in class and when I'm working on digital art. Worth the price!
5,It's genuine and working well
5,Works great with my surface for school...  I take it everywhere
5,Bought as a replacement. Easy to install and works like the original!
5,Very good
4,So far so good. Haven't had it to long.
4,Sexy but I do wish I could magnetically charge it while it was attached on the side.
5,I use this often.Cons are that it sometimes fails to connect vial bluetooth. However most of the function still work without that.Must have for a surface pro. Otherwise why get a touch screen tablet?
5,I Love the pen! It makes it so much easier to create work take notes etc. Now I'm addicted!
5,I like to take notes at conferences on my Surface Pro 5.  Pen works great with reversible eraser.  Not sure about art use.
5,Not the seller's fault but it sucks that microsoft makes us muy the pen when the surface book 2 is so expensive...
5,gift
5,Must have accessory for Surface products. Full functionality of your device will make tasks much better. Love this pen at such a great price.
3,It works well with the surface book 2 but I am having issues with the buttons they don't seem to work. I tried everything and the eraser button and side buttons are faulty and unresponsive.
5,Great pen and easy to use
5,A must have accessory to my Surface Pro LTE Tablet
2,Ordered this pen after my old pen (previous version) stopped working. At first I thought I had received a faulty pen lines were always breaking certain letters would be super dark compared to others with no change in pressure and my handwriting came out very shaky. Gave this the benefit of the doubt and ordered a replacement which turned out to do the same exact thing. I ended up ordering another pen of the previous version and that one works with no problems and even came with replacement tips for just $20 more.
5,nice
5,I like writing with it! I wish it was little lighter than it is.
5,The pen is as essential accessory for surface products. Arrived as described and on time.
5,Does what it's supposed to do. Works just fine. A little stiff on the side button but all the ones I have tried (admittedly few) feel the same.
5,Original
5,fast shiping
5,Great value quality look and functionality.
5,The pen works great. The shipping was fast and I really have nothing to complain about so yes five stars.
5,It works really good it takes time to get use to but once you are it very useful for every day tasks.
4,Excelente
4,Great pen wish is wasn't so damn expensive.
5,It's original product. Great pen for surface pro 6. Thanks a lot.
1,I purchased this product for full price and it was suppose to be NEW but upon receiving it the product was defective. The BIGGEST issue I have is not the defective product it is the fact that the product was clearly opened and even showed signs of wear. I did not pay for a used product I paid for a new product. Bought one from Microsoft and am satisfied with the product that still had a seal and the pen itself was even wrapped in plastic.
5,Authentic microsoft pen. Box was open but otherwise appears fine and works great.
5,Works really well.  Palm rejection is 95%.  Don't know what I did without this.
4,Great pen at an overpriced cost.
4,It works.
5,Completely worksWould not try anything but Microsoft (I did and wasted money trying to save money)
5,Bought as a gift boyfriend absolutely loves it! Works spectacular! Makes me want to buy a surface laptop just so I can use it lol.
5,Worked with my wife’s surface pro.
5,I cannot rate this item since I am giving this as a graduation gift to my grandson.
5,Everything is as expected works perfectly and was substantially less than buying at a big box store.
3,If you want to deal with me from now on it must be done through land based or sea based and air mail.This will be in effect till the end of the year 2018.
5,Very good!
5,I like the color like the grip of it and the size is great.
5,I like it alot very satisfied
5,Love it. Very fun. First thing everyone notices is that I can take notes on my laptop.
5,Works for what it’s advertised to do. Just the price sucks big time!
5,Great working with my New surfacepen and takes 7days only to Korea delievery.
2,Wrong color. Also buttons work but the tip is entirely unresponsive after one month already confirmed no visual damage to tip removed and re-paired disabled abd re-enabled in device manager etc.
5,It’s a surface pen.
5,The Surface Pen has an excellent feel and reacts well to pressure changes etc.  A joy to work with!!
5,This works great. I probably don't utilize all the features but I am happy with what I do know!
5,What I always wanted!
3,Seems great but mine did not come with the battery so I cannot write a real review
5,This pen is really good if you want the experience of writing on a piece of paper.
5,Haven't used this much yet but like the way it attaches to the side of my Surface Pro 4.
5,Real writing feeling when used with the surfacebook 2
2,The package was great! Thought I would be happy with the pen BUT as soon as I started using it there was so much jittering! Im a college student and I take my notes on OneNote so it was deffinately a NoNo! Had to get a replacement from microsoft which is on its way.
5,Ordered as a gift to son he leaves ves it and reommends it.
5,Awesome precision!
5,I lost my pen and got this one and love it. The new design and responsiveness is like no other.
4,Works as advertised
5,got a cheap deal so its good. I like it
5,Fantastic; makes highlighting a breeze
2,The package arrived with no battery although the package says batteries included.  So the pen did not work right out of the box.  I have to go out and buy batteries just to find out if the pen works.  I tried to submit feedback directly to the vendor but the system rejected my feedback.
5,Bought as a gift for my wife.  She loved it.
5,I was really anticipating this pen. It came quick and easy. I works amazing!
5,This item was a great price and arrive quickly
5,Excellent Seller
5,What can I say? it's rather pricey.. but I love it.. works great with my Surface Pro 2
5,Very responsive pen and being magnetic it sits very secure on the side of the SB2; love it.
1,Worked beautifully on my surface pro while it worked. Was just using it in class today taking notes and the black cover surrounding the grey tip came off. It looks like it was used to stabilize the tip so you can write. Now the tip is just floppy and almost unusable. It still writes but its no longer firm and wobbles everywhere making it look like i'm writing with Parkinsons. I just bought this July 20th and its October 1st... I don't know if there are replacement tips or if this can be exchanged for a new one as maybe mine was defective. I really hope its defective because I really do love this pen.
5,Good product
1,The pen tip broke after less than 10 uses would not recommend.
5,Easily pairs with the Surface Pro to make on screen writing a breeze.  Love it.
5,Worked perfectly.
5,Light weight.  easy to use. Love that it magnetically attaches to the side of the surface pro which eliminates looking for it.
5,Exactly what I was after synced right up first time and worked flawless.
5,Love this pen works a lot better than the Wacom one no duh
2,It worked for about 6 months then the ball point broker and now it doesn't work.
5,Easy to use touch features are great.Drawing is awesome with the pen
5,useful component for surface I like it.
5,Worked great right out of the box. No problems.
1,We purchased this as a gift for our college daughter. Because it was a gift it was not opened in enough time to send it back. It does not work. Tech support at her college was unable to fix it as well. Super disappointed that we are out the money and she doesn't have the pen.
5,Works great with my Surface Pro 3 OEM.
1,Even though I got a different colored pen it still worked. A day later it wouldn't write anymore. Seems to be a big issue if you look into this.
5,Great product.Never experienced Something like this:clean smooth quick....Surface Pro is definitely enhaced by the Surface PenGreat Job from Microsoft
5,Worked great once I made sure I had the right version for my surface pro
5,Works right out of the box. I didn't have to connect it even with the Surface Pro II.
5,Much better than Apple Pencil. The whole setup on Surface Pro with this pen is excellent.  Very productive.
1,Bought it used a month ago and it was so bent that I couldn't replace the battery and now it's past warranty. The tip was also worn into a nub as well. 45 dollars down the drain for me.
5,Works perfect with my surface pro. Easy to use.
5,it works much better than drawing with your fingers.
3,Toooo expensive!!!!!
2,The seller makes you pay to return and charges a 10% restocking fee. I was not aware until I received my refund- beware!
5,Great Buy
5,works exactly as I expected. No complaints at all. I'm glad I went for this .
5,Nice
4,good!!
4,Accurate
1,Very over-rated product as far as how long it will work properly.  I've had it less than a month & it no longer functions as it is supposed to.  Big waste of money!!!
5,Works perfectly with my Surface Book 2 13". A must have!
5,original working perfectly
3,Works well but the botton on top never took screenshots even though I sat it up
3,9 month of using and now it writes when above screen
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This is not worth the money. I purchased in January but only started using it a month ago. The black part on the tip of the pen broke within a month and it will no longer work. What a colossal waste of money!Next time I’ll just buy a knock off pen from another company and save myself $50.
5,I LOVE IT
5,My husband says it is great.Worth the cost
1,The one thing I really wanted out of this pen was being able to Draw & Paint.This is not easily possible for me with this pen do to its initial activation force. I do pretty light stroke on canvas especially during the sketching stage and the pen will not simply activate unless you put enough pressure down.This may not seem very noticeable to a lot of people. But it's pretty noticable to me being I usually draw with Wacom tablets. Pretty misleading since the description states it responds to the lightest touch 4096 levels of pen pressure.
3,handle is good durable . Found a bit complicated to use or switch modes.
1,Doesn't read good at all
5,Worked great
5,Worked right away and I love the quality and the color
5,Wery Good
1,I wish I had read all the negative reviews ahead of time. I had this pen for 6 months and it worked WONDERFULLY. It suddenly stopped writing a few days ago. I read all the troubleshooting ideas on Microsoft's page and none of them fixed the problem. I tried a cheap non-Bluetooth stylus and it worked so it's not my screen. Bluetooth pairing also works and the eraser still works. I ordered new tips thinking maybe it had been damaged. That didn't solve the issue. Save your $70 and get a cheaper stylus.
5,Great
2,The nibs man they suck and wear out get an updated one.
5,Works so well!
5,Came fast and just what I expected
5,Great product for a great price.
5,It worked perfectly with the 2018 hp spectre x360 13t.
1,This pen worked for just just under two weeks. Now it will not write. Tried to troubleshoot but still not operational. Can't say I would recommend it.
1,Stopped working after 4 months of use. Pen tip first started to break down. Ordered replacement tips from Microsoft would not work at all. Called Microsoft Support and support rep said Amazon would have to replace it. Better off with the lower cost model made by 3rd party vendor. Too expensive for this to stop working. And yes I tried everything you could imagine including wiping Surface go clean and starting over. This pen will not write the button features work but not the pen tip. I now use the cheaper pen and it works fine.
5,Son needed a new one.  Thank you
5,very handy product
5,Thank the seller that he is working at full capacity
5,Love it
5,Works great on my Surface Pro 6
5,Works well
5,With it tbh
5,Arrived on time great quality pen.
5,Easy to use always use it.
5,Great product works excellent
5,Works excellent.  Completes the Different experience with Surface book.
5,Pairing this pen was easy. Out of the box I was using the device within seconds.
5,Excelente
2,It stopped working after a short while. Eraser button works but tip does not. Tried different tips and it still doesn't work. Changed battery resynced tried everything.
5,awesome!
5,Works perfectly easily parlirable
5,Good for use
5,Haven't used it much yet but it works great!
5,Works as advertised
5,la piz origina de microsoft
5,Great. Works well with my surface.
1,We have tried to use this pen for over a month. We have had IT people help with it and it doesn’t work. It turns on but doesn’t work with the computer at all even though the description says it should.
2,Loved this pen at first. It feels great in your hand. It's intuitive and well designed. But after a few months the tip fell apart and stopped working. I ordered a replacement set of tips but they don't work either. Very frustrated.
5,Very smooth
5,It’s great!
1,After less than half a dozen uses the pen just stopped powering up. No new batteries or updates could fix it. Calling Microsoft Support is a soul suck and they offered no solution. After having wasted hours on the phone and on online chats I'm calling it quits. I'd recommend saving your money on this one.
3,Replaced the battery but could not revive.
1,Not the color I ordered blue is different than silver. Microsoft what happened to your accuracy? I won't buy again
1,It never worked. Piece of krap
5,Loved it !
5,Great product
1,Pen won’t write. Little over a year old and barely used. The pen works but won’t the tip will not write. I replaced the tip and the batteries. Disappointed to say the least. These pens are not cheap.
5,Good product
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I am not rough with the pen or overuse it but it stopped working after 2 months where I used it to do homework and take notes. The eraser button still works (will erase) and my surface recognizes the Bluetooth connection and battery life but the tip won't draw. I have tried to troubleshoot it with solutions from the internet but none have worked. I have read that many people have this problem with quality. I bought this at $60 for 2 months of use which is unacceptable coming from a well-renowned manufacturer like Microsoft.
5,Great product.
5,Working good
5,Excelente
5,Pressure better than Apple Pencil
5,Its pretty nice. pretty expensive but it is built well...
5,good product and reasonable price
5,Its useful
5,The product quality is good
1,Purchased Nov 11. Now it doesn't work. Got a whole 4months out of this $72.00 pen. Sent and email to the seller no response. The eraser works but the pen tip does nothing. Replaced batteries did an update on it etc...Horrible product!!!
5,It's actually like writing on paper 😍
5,good
1,Item was not in the original box/packaging. If it's not going to be in the original packaging then that needs to be stated.
1,The microsoft pen paired easily and the eraser function worked but the pen did notwrite.  I tried updating my windows software and I tried removing the device from bluetoothand paring the device again.  I'm returning the stylus pen and will probably try orderinga new pen.  Clearly this is an issue with this stylus pen.  Microsoft needs to clear this up.Very disappointed.
5,Excelente
5,Wonderful
1,I thought I lost my original surface pen got this surface pen to replace it but it  did not work. After I spent a few hours trying to troubleshoot I returned it. Seller was great about a refund. I later found my original pen and it worked fine immediately confirming that it was the pen not the setup.
5,Works as it should.
1,The pen tip stopped working. The eraser end still works though. I have had this pen for a little over a month. Physical condition is great. It has never been dropped. Same problem as my first one which last 8 months. I am never buying this pen again. Microsoft support for this pen is not helpful. Amazon gave me a return label. Thanks!
1,Pen tip stopped working 4mo. after purchase. Apparently this is a common problem and requires a replacement through Microsoft. Not worth the hassle! Waste of money.
1,Take the time and read the reviews. This is NOT an authentic Surface Pro pen.
5,Excellent product.
5,Well done
5,Great product! Its exactly what i wanted.
1,i have a Microsoft Surface Pro. Pen works intermittently. No technical support. All the websites have remedial solutions such as "try turning your computer on and off/check for updates/check your battery"
5,Works great.
5,As described
5,Perfect pen. Thats all )))
1,The pen stopped working after 6 months!!! Tried replacing the tips didn't work either. This is the second time Microsoft pen broke on me. I can't afford such a high price for something that doesn't even last more than a year. Not gonna recommend; not gonna buy any more Microsoft pens. Don't bother.
5,Works perfectly
5,Works perfectly.  Original MS product.  5 stars.
5,Its perfect for me
5,Excellent...but pricey
5,It worked as advertised

5,Great product. Expensive
5,Excellent stuff
5,As good as new.
5,Good feel in the hand and on the screen.
5,Surface Pro
5,Works great thanks
5,👍🏾
5,Arrived on time and as advertised.
5,Useful
5,Hand writing experience in Surface tablets is awesome!
5,nice
1,Bought this in 2019 and now it no longer pairs up with the bluetooth at all despite changing its batteries and barely having used it. Terrible given the fact this pen was around 80 dollars.
1,The item did not consistently work with my surface pro 7
5,Totally better than the previous Pen
5,Very nice
1,Usually had decent luck with buying "Used" items on Amazon but this one was terrible - the original box was the only thing that was in "Used - Very Good" condition. The pen was clearly physically defective and did not work
5,Quick delivery item accurately described. A++
2,the tip fell out of the pen shortly after use. Otherwise no problems with it. However it is a bad situation as I use the pen almost continuously with photo editing in Photoshop
5,Awesome
1,I bought this pencil thinking that when I bought the original it would be of better quality than the ones that cost a third and are generic but I was wrong. The pencil never worked.
1,its good and i like it but it's so expensive and if you want the truth it's doesn't worth itthe performance is much less than I thoughtand you have a lot of alternative with a better performancei think the thing make it expensive the size because it's so light but this not enough to be like this price
1,This pen was defective when I received it ..ended up purchasing a off branded pen instead as it had more control.
5,works perfectly
5,Excellent
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 After not even a month the tip of the pen started bending and eventually it started bending 360. This makes it very difficult to write on my surface pro laptop. It is cute and very easy to use but it is defective and I spent a lot of money on this. Complete waste of money because it’s a Microsoft pen.
1,I saw the picture of the "Ice Blue" pen and really liked it. I ordered this product and received a grey/blue that is not even close to the "ice blue" they show in the picture. Save your money and buy a different one.
1,As with other reviewers the pen was amazing for less than 2 months before the tip started to break off. I had to order tips to replace them. At the cost of this pen there should be replacements included. Expected more from Microsoft.
5,Bette than I imagined
5,Works as intended
5,Very good
5,Love it
5,works great
2,As stated arrived with a rundown tip and low battery
5,Great thanks
1,I love the product I’ve owned one before.  However I was sent a defective device that was used. The deal was broken and it was not wrapped in plastic as all new Surface Pens should be.
5,Thanks
5,good
1,The "Ice Blue" version of the pen has a picture that is definetly blue however the actual "Ice Blue" pen is more of a grey color not much on the blue spectrum there.  Very annoying......
1,I purchased a surface pro i7 256gb 8gb ram I received it and the box stated what I purchased. When I checked the settings to see why the surface pro was moving so slow it was apparent it was an I5 model inside. The seller did a bait and switch
1,I got this today.  Product came as a refurbished pen.  I thought I was buying a new product.  Buyer beware these are NOT new surface pens.
1,The pen quit working after only a week. It will erase but not write.
1,I bought this pen in January - worked fine for a few months but shortly after the warranty period it stopped working properly.  It still connects and I can click the pen to open notepad but it won't write or draw - no inking functions at all.
1,Worked great initially but after roughly 6 months of extremely light use and careful storage it stopped working. Only the eraser works. For $70+ this shouldn't be an issue seen so often. Can not recommend this product.
2,Pen isnt working delivered on time but cant turn it on even after changing battery !!!!
1,This product stopped working today without a reasonChanged batteries but dis not workBad product
1,Stopped working two days after I got it. Replaced battery still doesn't work. Never abused it or anything. Only used it to sign names on forms for work four times a day.
1,The pen which I paid $100 for began malfunctioning about 8 months after I got it. I guess that's how long they design them to last because it's not eligible for support. Microsoft doesn't seem to care about their products or their customers once they've got your money.
1,Died after about 40 days of use. It will not draw;(“tip”) inoperative. (Yes I tried all applicable troubleshooting steps) Into the trash it went. Complete wash of time and money.
2,way too expensive it's just a pen after all
1,Nowhere is it mentioned this is a refurbished product and not new as expected. This would not be a problem if it was mentioned.
1,It wasn’t blue.
1,It broke two months after I got it.  I contacted the company and they won't contact me back.  Bad product don't buy.
1,Pen broke after minimal use over 3 months... Microsoft website says it is out of warranty even though it isn't. No options on site for recourse.
1,This is the second pen I have bought that has had the nib break within a couple months.  This product is too fragile and doesn't come with proper warnings about its fragile construction.
1,It came broken and won't at all smh
1,I used it here and there for about 2 hours. I came back a few hours after and it wouldn't work.
1,Entirely different color than the preview images
1,Spent the money for Microsoft stylus but it only worked for two weeks
1,Finally opened it to find out that it was damaged at the tip! Sending this one back and then ordering a replacement !
1,Microsoft Surface Pen Platinum Model 1776 (EYU-00009) is an expensive item it is very upsetting to get something that doesn't work and go trough the returning process and waste of time.
1,After using it a few times the writing tip broke! I should have bought something cheaper!
1,Brought one of these pens home from work to work on my laptop. Right off the bat that one didn't turn on. There was no light. Did some troubleshooting and discovered it was dysfunctional.Cool. So I bought another. Used it for about a month then one day it just stopped working. Same as the other one. No light. Tried troubleshooting but no luck.I have no idea how I managed to get 2 broken pens.
1,I bought this pen new and it arrived looking like it was a used and returned product.
1,devolviendo todo con el tablet
1,The pen generally is good but the tip of the pen broken easily. It is not strong. It is made from low quality materials.
1,Prone to bad wear and tear.  Support window ends in 2 months and started disintegrating at 3 months.
1,The tip fell out and was broken after a week of use...Not worth the money or the frustrations.
1,The tip breaks easily. There are no replacement tips provided they're expensive to replace and without the tip it is useless.
1,I did not receive the product in the package. The delivery was ok but inside de box i found the other products not the pen.
1,My Microsoft Surface pen failed within 4 months of purchase.
1,Also charged me 5 dollars to return!
1,I didn’t even get the thing
1,Surface pen did not work and customer service told me I could not return the product and stopped replying to my emails.
1,its all good  but i am giving bad review for not selling it with the official price USD 99.
5,Yet to exploit it fully.  Good product.
1,Product stopped working less than 2 weeks after purchase. Pen does not ink but other functions work intermittently. Microsoft said the product was defective
3,So my first surface pen was purchased in 2019 and it worked great until a year later when the tip suddenly stopped working. The eraser still worked fine and only the tip was broken. I looked this problem up and tried everything that was suggested on the internet. However none of those worked for me. I figured my pen was just too old so I bought a new one. This time not even THREE DAYS after my purchase my pen tip stopped working! I was so disappointed. I love the functionality of this pen while it still works but its life span is just so inconsistent and frustrating. I ended up buying a 30 dollar knock-off one and it works fine. Do what you will with this information...
1,Got the platinum and it quit working exactly one week after the manufacturer warranty would've covered it. 🤦🏽
1,Not writing or pairing and I've tried trouble shooting
1,This pen sratched the side of my surfacebook 2!!
3,This pen worked really well on my Surface Go 2 in EVERY way...until I upgraded to Windows 11. It stopped working immediately after I installed the upgrade.
1,Really bad
1,The box came without the pen in it. Returning and ordering another one.
1,I bought the keyboard for my daughter - 1/2 the keys do not work.
1,Died in less than a week. Terrible. Amazon was great about taking it back.
1,I GOT A RIPOFF PEN THAT ISNT THE REAL THING IN THE ORIGINAL MICROSOFT BOX. SHADY!
5,I bought the pen from the Microsoft store the day it was released with the new surface but the review is more relevant here. I've spent a lot of time with the pen. It's good and I like it.I wanted to minus one star because my pen didn't come with anything telling how the device worked beyond a small pamphlet telling me to connect via bluetooth and then a link to the Microsoft forums which didn't help me with some setup difficulties. But I decided the pen is so good and I'm so happy with it that my few complaints weren't worth detracting a star.These are the things I love: (Note that all of my use has been in Photoshop.)First the pen is incredibly precise. I've been able to draw a line lift my hand then place the pen exactly where I left off to continue the line. I've not been able to do this with previous pens.Second the sensitivity is impressive. When testing the ability to draw lightly the line was so light that I couldn't see it without zooming in. I initially thought it wasn't doing anything.Last the pen is thinner than other digital pens I've used and so feels more like a real pen or pencil. The weight is about right too. I don't know other people's opinion but to me this is something that matters.These are my complaints: (Note that all of my use has been in Photoshop.)First and most annoying is if your finger or hand touch the screen before the tip of the pen is detected the pen will not write. I always have to lift up my hand and make sure the pen tip touches before my hand does.Second the jutter on the pen stroke is fixed... Mostly. I'm still getting jutter on the pen stroke when my hand is resting on the screen as though the tablet is wavering the stroke between my hand and the pen. Using a drawing glove negates this effect.Third tilt works in most native programs but (at least in Photoshop) the tilt function is linked to brush settings and has to be set up to work. Being a novice in Photoshop I still don't know where these setting are and I haven't been able to use the tilt in Photoshop at all.I anticipate these are negligible for most people and can be fixed with a bit practice use and experience with the pen. But it all is pretty frustrating.
5,Muy bueno
1,Every time I have bought a Surface Pro Pen the plastic casing that supports the rubber portion of the tip has fallen off after two months. I have bought two Surface Pro Pens and refuse to buy another due to the quality of the tip. Don't waste your money buy a pen with a better tip.
1,this product breaks every time i get one. don't waste your money its what this company wants you to do
5,I bought this pen from Best Buy in the color Burgundy to match my mouse. I am in love with this pen. My hand no longer gets tired of scrolling on the screen when I don't want to use the mouse. I've been coloring and writing with it and it truly feels like a pen. I had an issue with lagging at first so I went back to Best Buy. Apparently Chrome uses too much CPU to use it with the pen and not cause the surface pen to lag. Since I've been exclusively using Microsoft Edge I've had zero issues with lagging even while using multiple applications at a time. The pen is magnetized so it also sticks to the side of the surface securely. The pen is definitely worth the price to me if you want to get the most out of the surface and the apps made for it.
5,Works flawlessly.  I really like the idea of it being magnetized so I can keep it attached to the side of the screen.  Very strong magnet. Haven't totally figured out the eraser yet  but that's just me.  Great product. Have to see if I can lower the sensitivity.
5,Purchased as a less expensive alternative to the Lenovo Miix 630 Pen FRU 01FR716 .  Works great. Pressure sensitivity works as expected.
5,Excellent. Well packaging and sturdy pen
5,Great pen easy to work with. Nice gift for friends.
5,Good first impressions with the unboxing premium feel will update when used
5,5/5
5,Very high quality product with extremely high quality materials. Works great with Microsoft Surface Products. I use a Surface GO.
5,Great product
5,Easy to use very sensitive and smooth movement.
3,Ok. This really urks me. Microsoft is charging $99 for this new stylus but heres the kicker. It doesn't eliminate line jitter. What that means is you won't be able to draw completely straight lines when doing ink work or tracing as an artist unless you purchase the aftermarket software Lazy  Nezumi that will practically render any stylus to draw straight. Thats an additional $35. Another major disappointment is that the pressure sensitivity is built into the tablet. So if you're using a SFP 4 or older model you won't be able to take advantage of the $4000+ pressure sensivity. The pressure sensitivity on your current stylus will remain the same. So since theres no significant changes or improvements for pre dated Surface Pro users why spend a whopping $99 on a new stylus you might ask? Good question.  My advice. Save yourself some $$. Download Lazy Nezumi if you haven't already and ditch the Surface Pro Pen. Your results are going to be the same with or without it.
2,I have had to buy two of those so far and both have broken. The first one broke within a year usually only kept attached to my Surface. It may have been mishandled simply due to falling off into my backpack as I went from class to class.The second broke within two months. I had learned my lesson from the first time and had this one always inside a hard-shell carrying case to keep it secure. I thought that I would get AT LEAST a year of use out of it but the inking simply died on me. I followed all of the steps on the Microsoft Support site to diagnose the issue and the only recourse left to me is to replace the Pen. This is a premium accessory for a premium product and the level of quality control Microsoft has is simply embarrassing. This is not the first surface accessory to random;y break on me (the other being the charger) and when they charge an arm and a leg for any individual piece one would expect them to last more than a year.I was very happy with my Surface at first and it still has the potential to be a great productivity tool but I cannot recommend it (or any of the first-party accessories) to anyone until Microsoft decides to produce quality accessories.
1,Pen is no longer responding. Usually you'd have a cursor show up under the pen tip but even that won't show up. Only the eraser is working. I haven't had any serious drops with this pen either (I've been treasuring this thing since it was so expensive).This pen was great until it stopped working. I've tried everything I can to get it functioning again. I spent $90 bucks on  pen that has now quit on me (salt in the wound it's listed as $70 buck not even two months later from when I purchased it). I bought this pen to draw on my tablet heck I splurged even for the eraser feature and the tilt function. Tilt function never worked (Surface Pro 3- said it would work on my model). I didn't complain cause it really was fantastic. Very responsive! Felt much nicer than my older model! But now here I am. Broken pen. No way to fix it without shelling out more money that I don't have. Honestly I'm extremely put out. With an issue this common (just look through the other sour reviews) you'd think they would have fixed this. I'm not sure what I'm going to do now that my pen is essentially useless. It's no good to me if only the eraser is working.
1,Stopped working after six months and was under warranty.  I called in and Microsoft pulled every trick to try and avoid replacing the pen.  I insisted they replace it.  After 1.3+ hours on the phone they finally agreed.  Then the rep said he would send me an email for me to upload my receipt (even though purchased via MS).  Guess what the email never came.  MS has outsourced its support to a non-MS service/independent contractor.  So they have no desire to actually provide support.  I will never purchase another MS product again. Avoid MS products get a Samsung tablet instead.  My son got one of those and loves it.  He has not had any problems.
2,Wish I have read more reviews.  I only bought this because I thought surely the surface brand would be the best option. The pen was great while it worked! Used it for 2 months without a problem then all of a sudden the pen side stopped working. I tried everything. New battery ran all updates restarted the surface re synced the pen and nothing. Eraser side works but the pen side is a bust.. hoping I can get my money back but I'm not counting on it from other reviews I've read.
2,Pen is too heavy too slippery to hold and when it is dropped which it will be it falls tip first. A few times of this and it is unusable. In the realm of the computer pen world not worth money or hassle to replace. And honestly how many features on a computer pen does the average person truly need ?
1,Recently my 3 month old Surface pen stopped working just like many of you guys who also reviewed. The eraser still works. but it just wont write. I tried everything to fix it meaning downloading new drivers and updates re-pairing the bluetooth restarting the pen checking the batteries running the Surface Diagnostic and more. To be honest it worked great when it was actually working but to pay 100 dollars from a reputable company is unacceptable. WHats worse is that even the Microsoft support person I tasked for help said that he'd seen many issues with the pens and that it was probably bad. I'm sorry but I don't recommend buying this device.
3,Over priced. No pen clip.
3,tip broke really fast about 3 days of use
1,The surface pen is awful. It loses connection misplaces touches and is a nightmare to try to get working. I have a surface book and often try to take notes on it. The surface always misplaces the tip of the pen and thinks it is about a millimeter above where it should be. I have gone through 3 new pens and 2 laptops trying to fix this problem to come down to a simple conclusion to just buy any other type of pen
2,I’ve been using this with a Surface 3 (not the pro version) for about 6 months now. The pen works well but it doesn’t have a clip like the previous one did. It took me 5 months to manage it but I’ve finally lost mine. Poor design on Microsoft’s part it’s incredibly easy to lose. I keep track of my stuff but had 3 close calls before this.
1,Had this pen for about 18 months and used it less than 10 times in that period... tried to use it today only to find that it doesn't "ink" (i.e. can't write) on my surface laptop anymore. Doesn't help that Microsoft customer support is non-existent. Won't recommend anyone to buy this... which is unfortunate since the Surface Laptop is a great piece of hardware.
1,The tip broke off of my pen and is so fragile to the point that I was worried about it breaking (which happened not so long after realizing this...) Such a waste of money! Wish I could get my money back because this is pretty ridiculous. I expected more.
1,The top button and the one in the middle don't work. I can only draw and click with this 100 dollar stylus. Totally disaster. Most expensive stylus in the world. I've tried many times the Microsoft recommendations but I got the same exact result: zero.Don't buy it definetly there are plenty cheaper stylus in the market.
1,The eraser button works but the pen stopped writing after 1.5 months.  Tried multiple troubleshooting methods provided by Microsoft and other youtube videos and none of them work.
1,Never seen a product break so fast the pen stopped writing while all other aspects still worked. Apparently this is a huge issue might as well buy it from a place that gives you a year warranty you will need it.
1,I have been through two of these in under a year.  They suddenly stopped writing.
5,The pen does it's intended job is very comfortable and really slick! I do however need much more time using it - right now I'm spending more time with keyboard/mouse and need to get creative!!!
5,This is all that I needed to add to my Microsoft Surface Pro 3 to make it complete. It works really nicely and I really love it. I would recommend it to anyone.
4,aye the only issue I had is how easy the tip was to break. Maybe I banged it somewhere without realizing. I had to order new tips.The pen is amazing
5,but its a little thin for bigger hands.
5,it got here in a day and works so well
5,As advertised. Even better than I expected. It was pretty much brand new down to the NIB and battery.
1,Clicking the "eraser" doesn't do anything like its supposed to. Waste of money
5,I recommend this pen to anyone that has a Microsoft surface
5,Pen pIRS pretty much by itself. good features and free apps you can use. Sturdy feel
5,Love this pen and the prices was great.
5,This is a magnetic pen so be careful it will like to attach to anything it can.  Works great though and easy to set up.
5,Easy to use durable and super reliable
2,Came in silver and the button is too hard to press in
1,work sporadically at best and tip stopped entirely in about 8 weeks
5,Love the programmable commands for the eraser and side button. This makes jotting notes a breeze. Definitely a must have with the surface!
5,Easy to use
5,This pencil is great ! Works perfectly with the Microsoft Surface Go
5,It is so easy to use it glides on the screen very good product.!
5,Good
5,When I touch the screen with this magical wand I feel like one of those kids at Hogwarts. Just swish and flick a little more pressure a little less pressure  smooth very little lag and it doesn't seam to mind the greasy cheetos finger prints.
5,I'm sorry if I sound a little frustrated but I when I bought this surface pen I thought it would actually you know write on surfaces! I guess not. I mean why would you put the word surface in the product name if it doesn't actually write on any known surface. I tried it on paper glass quartz and drywall. Nothing! I tried it on a hat on a cat and a bat. I scribbled on sidewalks scrawled on sandpaper and even squidoodled on a squid! This thing didn't make a single mark. I tried left-handed right-handed with my toes and up my nose behind my ear in my hair and on my chair. This pen didn't write anything. About the only thing it did was scratch the paint on my neighbor's brand new Kia Sedona. Now my neighbor is suing the family of the kid across the street because he thinks little Roger was the culprit. I would write him a letter and confess but I can't. I'm pretty sure there's not even any ink or lead or blood in this thing. Unbelievable! I eventually threw it out because what am I doing to do with a pen that doesn't write? Use it as a tooth-pick?!I guess I'm not frustrated just disappointed. You want to know something funny? I actually had one of those Microsoft Surface tablets you know the ones you're supposed to be able to write on? I bet this supposed surface writing pen would have worked perfectly on it but I guess I'll never know because I spilled beer all over the tablet and now it's ruined.Sleek design. You will look very cool holding it.
5,Accurate and fast
5,Does what it's supposed to do. I'm not an artist so can't evaluate the pen for artistic use. Seems sto be working as it should otherwise.
5,Love this pen. Works as a mouse.
5,I just got it I will come back if any negative feedback. So far I absolutely love it!!!❤️‍🔥
5,Excelente producto muy buena calidad
4,Arrived fast. Paired (though i had to pair manually). Buttons function but tip does not. It will not write or recognize the pen tip.(Already paired a second time. Already updated windows. Etc) tip is still not workingUpdate: after several computer restarts and several forced pairings (forgetting device in order to pair anew) it seems to be working now.  Here’s to hoping
5,Wanted a tablet that has a large screen. The size of the screen was what got me into the surface pro. The surface pro 7 is a nice upgrade with quite a few features. I like the i5 without the fan. The i7 with the fan is too pricey for me and the fan would make it seem like a laptop. So with the surface pro 7 purchase I would recommend this Microsoft Pen. This thing is so much fun to use on the tablet. The snip and send and whiteboard are quite nice. It works as a pointer and mouse and has many features that I won't get into now. I will only say that if you want a surface pro you will want the pen. If you get those I would recommend the keyboard also. They are welcome additions to the surface pro. Of course the cases will add to the whole package for a quality laptop tablet windows 10 later windows 11 experience.
5,top song
4,The black tip of the pen came off but the pen works just as well. I have a screen protector for my surface so I am not worried about any scratches. Still I expected a better design.
5,What can I say?  Fast shipping and brand new.
5,this is the real deal. I know it says it is but now I know for sure. lots of fakes out there. thanks.
5,My community college went virtual in 2019 and to accommodate the virtual protocols I had to buy a new computer and paraphernalia. I've always been a "board-user" -- chalk and white. The Surface Pen helped make the transition easier. The pen is magnetic and holds firmly to the side of my tablet and it works just like a piece of chalk or white-board marker with the chalkboard mode of my screen.  The Surface trademark did not let me down and the adjustment to teaching virtually was a little easier using this pen.
5,Excellent Thank you!
5,I can’t wait to really learn how to use this well. So far it’s reliable and fun. Just need to completely understand how to use the “right click” for cut and paste etc.
5,Works with my MS Surface.
5,Can not live without it
5,The laptop is more fun now
5,The color is really the same italian blue as the keyboard !Works perfectly with my surface pro
5,Utiliser comme souris aussi mais avec beaucoup d'autres qualités
5,Love it
1,When I originally opened the package it said that it came with a battery to use immediately. Upon opening I realized the pen would not turn on. Originally I believed this to be a battery issue not a pen issue. I went ahead and bought replacement batteries and the pen still did not work. The LED light turned on and immediately turned off. After multiple troubleshooting methods it appears I just received a faulty product. This was the second faulty product I received from this company in the same week. Don't know if it was just a bad manufacturing line or just sheer bad luck but was really disappointing.
4,Great pen will start with upsides since overall I'm very happy with it:It writes well and feels right in my hand more like a HB pencil but a bit thicker. Satisfying to write with and on the surfacebook (almost) feels like writing with marker on paper in the sense of how the "ink" flows. No palm rejection issues on surfacebook.Some downsides:-right click is weird (need to hold on the side button then tap on screen) but you get used to it.-not very much customizability available for other button..-Major downside is having to change the battery. Batteries are 4A which I didn't know existed before this. Was kind of hoping there was a different way to charge it but found a work around buying a rechargeable 4A battery (bought on amazon came with 2 batteries) so I don't have to frantically try and find this off battery type at a store when needed and need it you will. Battery also just suddenly dies with no warning. I use my surface pen to take notes on my surfacebook while I'm on conference calls not cool if it suddenly dies without a warning of some sort.
1,Ordered The Microsoft Surface Pen - Ice Blue as a gift for my daughter.  It was delivered within 48hrs unfortunately that is the only good thing with this product. Everything looked great until the box was opened. The pen inside was silver had two buttons purple eraser not magnetic made of cheap plastic and as far as I could tell not even a Microsoft pen. Luckily the pen didn't have a battery. Otherwise my daughter might not of said  anything to me about the pen. Extremely disappointed as this item states "Ships from and sold by Amazon.ca". Definitely looks like someone deliberately switch the pens somewhere along the way.
4,I like this pen. I used a cheap off brand before this and they both were good. Plus for this pen the interchangeable batteries and tips. Con it's not always accurate unless you want to zoom in to ungodly pixels. Plusz I wish the eraser was a different shape. Using a round eraser on a digital screen is almost impossible to be accurate with
3,Product with worth much more than three stars however read carefully because mine wasn't battery included. So I went out to get a battery only to find out that the pen was defective. The company took it back and I was reimbursed so I still gave three stars.
2,Look if you want a stylus from the tablet manufacturer (Microsoft) and are willing to spend the money then this pen is fine in almost everyway. Very precise and easy to use. My biggest issue is that there is NO ERASER BUTTON. You must completely invert the pen each time you want to erase as the erase is mapped to the back of the pen. And no way to remap it to the side button. Speak of the side button is kind of hard to press and its mapped to the "selection" hotkey. The eraser mapped to the back of the pen makes it hard to accurately erase in onenote and drawing since the back of the pen is thick when compared to the tip. As well as being annoying to flip the stylus everytime you erase.The thing is third party stylus' are equally as good in terms of performance for half the price some even cheaper. AND THEY HAVE AN ERASER BUTTON. I can't stress how important this eraser button is for writing notes and for drawing. So much more precise.
5,Comparado con el anterior modelo este resulta mejor ya no hay que presionar tanto el lápiz para hacer trazos de manera suave. Se extraña el sujetador que tenían antes lo hacía sentir más seguro. La inclinación del lápiz funcionan bien pero la forma de punta hace que al inclinar de más el cuerpo del lápiz llegue a raspar la pantalla la forma de la punto debería ser como los de apple (más parecido a un lápiz de madera y no a un lapicero)
5,Perfect for my Surface Go. Effortless pairing best writing experience on a tablet I've had. Icing on the cake the way it clicks into place on the side of the Go magnetically.
5,I bought a $5 one and a $30 one for my windows surface wanting to save some money  they just don't do the job.  Very high quality uses AAAA battery that is easy to find.  Very good build quality and feels good to write on. Perfect weight and feels nice in the hand.A must have for artists to get the 4000 pressure points. You can make nice shades and really acts like a pencil when drawing.In terms of the style I really like how it looks.  Looks very nice with the windows surface and matching.I also like how it attaches well to the side of the windows surface. This works by magnets and it works on both the right and left side of the surface which is very nice.  You feel like you are writing on a very smooth surface with the nice pen tip material.  It doesn't come with any case but I just put it in the pen pocket of my surface bag which is very common in surface bags.  Order the AAAA batteries from Ebay 2 months before you need it its cheapest there.
5,bien anduve dibujando gran parte con esta pluma y es mi salvación si tienen una Microsoft Surface y dibujan no necesitan otra pluma mas que esta eh probado otras plumas de precio mas económico pero no duran tanto como esta pluma además las puntas son mas fáciles de encontrar.
5,Para poder utilizar la surface al 100 es necesario la Surface Pen para poder usar  todas las opciones como captuarar pantallas rapido o bien utilizar las hojas para apuntar o buscar con tu letra en vez del teclado.
5,Excelente. Muy practico. Funciona perfectametne. Me ha servido mucho para la imparticion de mis clases. Lo he usado en diferentes dispositivos de Microsoft y funciona muy bien. Altamente recomendable
2,So I've had the pen for about 2 months now and it works fantastically. However just the other day the hard plastic protecting the tip broke off so now I'm left with a long bendy tip... I always keep it stored attached to my surface in the tablet's travel bag so I've no idea how it broke. It's quite unfortunate to say the least and it will definitely deter me from purchasing a replacement.
5,Battery life is great and the product feels good in the hand.
5,Ningún defecto encontrado (hasta la fecha) la PC la detecto enseguida fácil de usar y de detectar lo único es que las puntas se desgastan el uso y se tienen que adquirir repuestos.
4,La única observación es el uso de baterías AAAA que no son fáciles de conseguir especialmente ahora con las limitaciones para productos no es envíales. Sólo sugiero que pongan más visible este requerimiento.
4,Picked this up after my using my faulty Heiyo pen for months. I use 1st gen. surface and then pen works well for the money I paid. Only downside imo is that it requires AAAA batteries to function I'd prefer a usb charging cable.
2,My pen stopped working after only 2 months of occasional use.  If it's the battery then this battery is not as advertised.  If it's the pen itself then it's one expensive 2 months used.  I don't know what is the issue.  However I am not sure which battery to buy for this product so I am stuck.
5,Love this pen!  As advertised the pen is probably one of the best I’ve used to date.  Doing presentations and daily work is easy with this pen.  Definite recommend.
4,EVERYTHING IS EXCELLENT....THANK YOU.
5,I spent more to get a pen with the erasable end and small tip for clearer writing along with name brand so it would link with the Microsoft tablet I use.  My old pen was magnetized so it would "sit"/attach to the side of the tablet this one does not but minor.
1,Not compatible with Go 2
4,It works perfectly fine my only argue is lack of 2 buttons and expensive price
3,It says that it is the Ice blue - surface pen however when i received it it was merely the plain silver one. This is very disappointing considering this coloured pen was for some reason slightly more expensive
5,Es un buen producto funciona bien aunque no tiene las mismas capacidsdes de un apple pencil aún así es muy funcional recomendable (por cierto se pega magneticamente en el lateral de la pantalla asi que sienpre lo tendrás a la mano.
5,I bought for my daughter. She uses it to take notes in classes. Works very well.
5,Está muy práctico y lo utilizo para varios procesos en la Computadora lo cual me ahorra tiempos.

5,Does the job
5,The pen is awesome the only thing that sucks is that it only takes AAAA batteries but that’s okay. The pen is good and works perfectly.

5,It works

4,Great device. So smooth!
1,This pen doesn't work for signing docs unless you have a monthly/annual subscription plan . Useless! I used to be able to use my finger to sign when i first bought my surface pro they claim that people are illlegally signing documents.  As a result  me an actual and honest user who is recovering from an accident and needs to sign legal documents and medical related permissions cannot use this feature of the pen.Microsoft no longer supports signing.  This is useless! I paid my money to buy a surface so i would have the ability to sign my documents. NowI feel like throwing it out the window. I even wasted time trying to go to a microsoft store even with difficulty walking and there are no more microsoft stores in canada as microsoft has chosen to replace people with robots.The online customer support was not helpful either.
1,Very poor quality
4,cool but not sure I needed it.
5,I don't know why I got myself one - the darn thing is so pricey and the only thing I can draw is a Coconut Tree that somehow ends up looking like Bin Laden' beard...Got myself one just to complete my Surface Pro though - I got mine (the SP4) without the Pen but with the Type Cover... Simple but effective packaging by Amazon though it took its own sweet time to arrive. The Surface Pen Platinum does not work with all the features (for example Tilt and all 4096 Pressure Levels) on the SP4 as it does on the SP 2017 Edition...Having never used a Digital Pen all my life I need to now use it! So far I have just put in about 30 Minutes usage! Initial impressions are therefore that;- Its a Magnificent piece of Architecture- The Weight and Grip are just sooo right- Snaps Strongly onto the SP yet easy to grab out and work with it too!- It GLIDES over the SP's Screen making a slight Ssss sound - feels Great!- Works as my finger works as a Pen too- More than losing it I am mortally scared of dropping it on its Tip... Shudder!!- Where do I get cheap long-lasting AAAA Batteries from next year for the Surface Pen???Edit after a year plus of using the Surface Pen: the Batteries are still over 50% so I can put off buying replacement Batteries for another year! Batteries cost a small fortune too... And err. although I haven't suddenly turned into an Artist I do love having the Pen around to sign Digital Documents or just to wow people! 😁😎
4,I ordered this pen and it is my first pen usage as stylus on surface pro 6. Somehow I think the oen I received has its tip a little bit broken from its round edges at the tip itself(the rubber part).I didn't noticed it at the purchase time. But I found it while using it on tablet in a tilted mode.Be sure to check it for urself. Otherwise the bluetooth connectivity is great and buttons too.
5,I thought i will make handwritten notes but this thing is fragile. The software is bad lines are non smooth edges in handwriting. Used on pro 6. Cant give it back because i hope it will be usefulbut if you want to take notes go for ipad pro and the pencil. The interface for touch is not so nice on windows.Edit - You will get used to it. Nice.
5,Little expensive ! But very  good features. It’s a perfect companion for surface ! Kudos to seller for prompt service.  5 starts for everyone. ( Seller .Amazon . Microsoft ! A must buy
4,Just like a pen sensitive and easy to handle. Value 4 money
3,It is pretty nice product you don't need to pair Bluetooth u can use it directly. The only drawback is it is a bit pricey then it should be
4,No clip for pocket not cover for pen tip
5,It is a brilliant tool for multipurpose usage. Can be a little less expensive but of course a very user friendly and high utility device.
4,I love this pen friendly to use
4,Good one
5,Working perfectly no problemsI use it daily for about 5hrs countinousStill it's battery is 92% after 2 months
5,Feels like a normal pen
5,Works a dream!
4,Good quality  but very costly
3,okay
5,perfectly compatible with Surface go 8gb model.It is so much comfortable in hand as well as on tablet.
5,arrived in very safe  package and works very fine fluid and accurate.the pressure sensitive tips feels premium.very pricey in India.
4,Nice one
3,The tip of the pen is a little loose.Is it normal or did i receive a defective piece
5,loved it !!!! and it is damn smooth.
5,One of the best pens!!
3,Useful for artists
5,Good product
5,It’s good one for Painter..
5,works well. Though expensive recommended for microsoft surface pro.
5,Good
5,Ok
1,The pen is pathetic. Couldn't work properly. Had to change the battery twice. Do not buy this pen. Paid 10k for the pen and output is zero.
4,Perfect!
5,Item as described.
4,battery was DOA other than that pen works great as you expect from a surface pen
5,Old one was somehow broken. Love its functionality. Didn't choose another brand. Didn't want to risk losing the functions or ha the hassle of setting up different buttons
5,High quality product with fair price. Work well with Dell laptop.
1,The pen was working really well at start out of the box and all.One day the pen tip and side button stopped working. The weirdest part is that the rear bluetooth button still works without issue.Tried reconnecting changing the battery updating drivers uninstalling drivers power cycling my surface book 2. Will keep trying but really frustrated that a 100$+ pen stops fricking working after few months.Piece of crap don't buy.
1,Setting the pen up out of the box was easy using it wasn't a problem at all. However pen died 4-5 months after purchase. Spent hours trying to troubleshoot issue to no avail. Now I have a fancy looking expensive plastic stick that sticks to my laptop. I bought this pen for school and it failed me hard ended up having to turn to apple for school after this let down.
1,Literally just got it. It worked all day yesterday then this morning it stopped. It’s connected the buttons work but it won’t write. I’ve tried everything Microsoft suggested but nothing.
5,Excellent
1,Really ticked me off.
5,Great product and services
5,Funciona increíble como cualquier spen de esta marca pero me agrado la compatibilidad con mi surface pro x llego sin ningún problema.
1,This product is a scam it is fake and does not work. The seller is uncommunicative and refuse to address the issues.
5,Funciona bien pero es un poco incomodo el boton izquierdo aunq a todo nos podemos acostumbrar
1,Hola no escribe. He hecho todo lo que me han dicho y sigue sin escribir. Si funciona el boton pero no funciona. perdi la pluma original y funcionaba perfecto. esta no funciona a pesar de todos los "tips" que me han dado desde reiniciarla los drives la pila.
5,llegó en tiempo y en buenas condiciones el precio es elevado pero esperé a que tuviera un precio mas accesible para adquirirlo de esta manera tener el juego del mismo color con el teclado.
5,Funcional
1,I got it for my surface pro 7 thinking it will work smoothly but I was wrong. The precision wasn't close enough to be able to do simple tasks such as clicking menus.
1,Lasted barely more than a month used maybe 5 times and quit. Got refund -20 percent restocking fee Microsoft wouldn't even answer tech support online or on phone. Probably turn me off of Ms products overall. Go for the win Microsoft pump out crap and don't answer won't sucker me again.
1,AAAA Battery was dead on arrival. Unable to find replacement batteries.
5,Excelente es compatible con mi Surface Pro 4.
