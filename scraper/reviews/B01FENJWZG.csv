5,Its mostly put together right out of the box. There's a few pieces that you'll need to attach. I feel this stand is very customizable depending on your playstyle. Its very sturdy and when I'm finish I can just slide it to the side. I have lots of extra screws that I didn't need to use. I just put them in a small bag and put them up for later. The instructions are not the greatest but it only takes a little common sense to figure out what screws to use for what device. Very happy with my purchase and highly recommend this product.
4,I tried other brands before and they were a pain to assemble and very flimsy. This one is super easy and solid. I'm only confused about this additional gear mount. It's literally useless frankly. If you attach it to the bottom of the stand as it should it will basically be in the way of your chair or your leg making is unusable unless you are a child.  The stand itself is just too narrow and anything sticking out from the bottom of it will end up blocking your leg.  If they wanted to do it right it had to go sideways first and then towards the driver. So I ditched it and just used the one that attaches to the side of the wheel stand.
5,I recently got a force feedback wheel and the force and vibration was way too intense to be desk mounted. It would literally shake my monitors and desk a bit so I needed something to get it off the desk. I was looking for something sturdy comfortable and easily movable if I wanted to sit normally and play keyboard style games.This GT Omega wheel stand fits the bill perfectly. It’s built extremely well and has everything needed to mount my G923 wheel and pedals plus all bolt holes line up. It does say foldable but I just slide it out of the way when I need to sit at the desk and slide it back when I’m playing a driving sim game.All in all for the price this is an extremely well built and though out design that will make your sim experience more realistic and fun without spending a crazy amount of money.
5,Fantastic quality for the price. Very adjustable and came with 2 stands for both gear shift and handbrake. The max height is like a computer desk. The pedal mounting plate tilts up and down and so does the steering mount.The instructions are bare minimum but the build is fairly fool proof. All the allen screws have the same thread pitch so it's just a matter of figuring which style goes where. There's a few with lock washers a few longer ones and a bunch of regular ones.All in all I couldn't be happier. It's very apparent that a lot of thought and care went into the design and build quality.
5,This is definitely a quality Sim Racing stand for the price has a lot of different adjustment settings the building part was straight forward BUT the instructions SUCK! they are bare bones if you don’t really have skill in building this might take you a while to build even tho it’s very simple other then that it’s a great product plus later on down the road you can add too this Sim Setup one reason I got this!
5,Absolutely amazing! I also  got the shifter for it!
4,The mount is stable unless you want to raise your wheel so it’s farther out. If you do that it will become shaky. You can extend it a few inches before it gets to a point where you can hardly do anything due to the shakiness. Also the instructions are pretty bad we ended up just resorting to pictures in reviews to put it together.
3,Great wheel stand and its very sturdy but can’t even use it. Make sure you scroll through ALL of the pictures or you’ll be paying $100 for just a wheel stand. Partly my fault for not reading the description. Don’t make the same mistake I did. I honestly don’t see why the first picture can’t just be the whole thing when you buy it. Everything is sold separately now days. Make sure you purchase everything separately or you’ll be looking dumb like I did.
4,Don’t get me wrong this is a great stand for the money.  It’s sturdy tough and fully adjustable.It has many predrilled holes for placement of equipment.  It’s working great!My issues with this unit are; to narrow.  It could have been a bit wider no adjustments in this area and since this is for auto racing I move around a lot hitting my legs on the bars. (I added some padding)They state that it easily folded up not true.  To adjust or “fold” the unit you must loosen two wing nuts then the steering wheel looses all support and drops to the floor.  It did fold up.  But this is the same process for adjustments in the steering wheel causing a weight issue.  Basically any adjustments you want to do with the steering wheel takes two people.Last is the feet.  They provide 4 round discs that thread into the bottom.  They are good for leveling but not for keeping it place on carpet.  I purchased some casters with leveling stands.  That way I can move it when needed but when it’s flat it does not move.  I also needed it elevated about 4 inches to match the height of my chair.  I don’t sit on the floor. Just raising the pedals and wheel doesn’t make it match upI may be pickier than most but I do virtual reality simulation racing and things have to be like they would be without the cost of reality. With some alterations this does great!!
5,Bought this for my son along with steering wheel  pedals and shifter.HEAVY box.  Was easy to set up and adjust.  Instructions have pictures  not many words. I would imagine it would be a little challenging for those that are not mechanically inclined. Only issue I had was changing sides for the shifter stand.Easy to attach the steering wheel shifter and pedal plate to the stand.  Screws for attaching came with the stand and they all fit great. There's several Allen keys 2 small wrenches  a bunch of screws  nuts and washers.  Everything you would need to attach your preferred equipment.Very pleased with this purchase.
4,First things first: I did a considerable amount of research on what would be the best stand for the racing rig I wanted to put together and GTOmega's was the best reviewed and most affordable for my price range.When I got it I found it came almost entirely pre-assembled in the box and simply needed some adjustments to fit my particular measurements and driving style. Having had it for a week of moderate-heavy use now there's been no apparent wear on the fasteners the pedals have remained firmly in place and the steel used shows no sign of bending warping or twisting at all.BUT...if there's ONE issue I have it's that the assembly instructions are rather vague about which bolts/washers/nuts they offer in a rather large bag of them need to be used to make sure the stand is 100% put together. Granted the types of fasteners will vary depending on the wheel you buy and for my Logitech G29 I only needed two bolts for the wheel and two more for the pedal platform.If GTOmega updated their instructions (which is a single page to begin with) to have a diagram of what fasteners you need for the compatible wheels that fit the frame it would answer a lot of questions that first-time racers would have and it would only enhance what is a VERY solid and well-constructed racing platform. That's the only reason I'm not giving it a five-star review.Seriously if you like racing games and are looking to switch over to a wheel-based rig this is worth the price.
5,Big fan of product. More impressed by the quality and how easy the set up was. 10/10
5,Wow! That is what really comes to mind. I used to love going to the arcade as a kid and playing on the driving games. The pedals the steering wheel the shifter all greatness. I was getting really tired of trying to race with the regular controller it just felt like there was something better out there. When Covid hit I really got into racing because my company went 100% virtual (it’s about time) and I went from putting 600+ miles a month on my truck to 50. So MOST of my driving was in front of the TV! I went ahead and bought a steering wheel shifter and pedals to get that “virtual” feeling. I quickly learned how sturdy a card table was. NOT. I tore that thing up in about an hour. I finally bit the bullet and purchased this stand. INCREDIBLE QUALITY!. This thing is a ROCK! It took a few minutes to put it together but after I got all of the stuff on. It and situated it was MAJESTIC. You know I got the “None of the other kids in the neighborhood have this” feeling.Now when I race it’s an event. I usually do 3-4 hour marathons on Forza and my scores have never been higher.I absolutely love this stand!
5,Looks good holds up to the stress of the tru force steering wheel. Adds great stability. Pretty easy to assemble as it arrived mostly pre-assembled.
5,I reviewed all of them on net.  I finally decided on this one but the complaints on lack of directions worried me a little.  All I can say is it comes almost completely put together and if you can figure out the rest well maybe you shouldn't be left by yourself much.  It is adjustable for different leg and arm length and overcomes every complaint I read about others stands.  I can't say enough about it.  Just perfect in my opinion.
4,This thing is really good quality and helps a lot but personally I would say spend a little bit more money and get one with a chair. This thing also takes up a lot of space and does not break down easy. I use the Logitech G923 on it and it fits great but just so big.
5,It is what it says it is. Easy to set up and use. I'm using the PS5 HORI RWA and with the exception of the pedal no way to actually mount them for now the steering wheel mounted perfectly. If you're wanting to stay cost effective but enhance your driving sime experience you can't go wrong with this.
4,It’s a solid lightweight slightly adjustable wheel stand. You have plenty of options for where to put your gear sifter if you have one. There is plenty of mounting points for both the week and pedals. I’d recommend if you need a stand have some space.
5,Wasn’t sure how stable this would be. Read a lot of reviews and most said it was a solid unit but you do t know how others define “sturdy”. Let me tell you that this stand is  S-T-U-R-D-Y. It is a well built and easy to assemble unit. Mine came with all the bolts washers nuts etc.  With spares. It has nice rubber feet you can screw in or out to level it on any surface. If using a mid to high end wheel with lots of torque(nm) it may move around a little if the action is heated but I used a couple of weights on top of the frame rails and it’s not going anywhere. If your on the fence go for it u won’t be disappointed
4,Nice rock solid product. Sits in place on the carpet and doesn’t move. Very adjustable and easy to put together out of the box. I had to deduct one star because folding it up is kind of a pain. It does fold but you need to remove 2 screws with plastic handles. I would have preferred buttons or some kind of quick connect.
5,This is a great stand for my Logitech G923 wheel set.  It came with both styles of side mounts.  I'm a bigger guy though and I ended up taking off the V1 side mounts as I kept running my leg into it.  I wish I could order a 2nd V2 side mount but they have been sold out for months.  It folds up if you need it to but I leave my up and just move it into place.  It's very sturdy and doesn't move on me when I'm "driving".  Highly recommended.
4,Sturdy stand. I like that it folds just be aware that once you have all if your peripherals attached it is quite a beast in size and weight. Making the folding option not as appealing but still usefull.4*s because mine came out of the box with rust all over the place. The powder coating should be thicker for sure.Watch out on light colored carpets you don't need Wife aggro because of your new toy...I added some pics to show some rusted areas there are plenty of other areas that had rust... I'm probably going to steel wool this thing and spray it with rust-oleum.
5,I like many reviewers that I read wasn’t too sure how this stand would be.  So to put it plainly…it’s great.  Very sturdy and was easy to put together which didn’t take long at all to do and it came with a gear shifter attachment that can be used on the left or right and attach either from the steering platform or from the bottom frame.  I use the bottom frame attach point.  I have been looking for a good stand for a while that wouldn’t take up a lot of room and was sturdy enough to last.  I had seen other stands that had just one pole that attached to the peddle platform and to me it doesn’t look like that would be too good with steering and torqueing put on the wheel at times. That may not be but that is why I did not buy one like that.  When I bought it they gave a 5-7 day delivery time for this and I didn’t think much about it until I noticed that it was coming from Great Britain.  Well I got it in just a couple of days!  So great price (since I presume being factory direct) and great shipping and all in all a great stand for my wheel and peddles and it collapses down for storage when you need to. The only drawback that I have with this is that you cannot adjust the angle of the peddle plate which is minor in comparison. So if you are looking to buy a sturdy stand that will last and has a shifter mount included and is at a great price compared to several others don’t wait… this will do the job!
5,After buying my very first sim wheel setup I quickly grew very tired of clamping my wheel to my desk just to have to remove it later to work on other things. A quick trip on Amazon later this stand was on my doorstep within days (actually a few days shorter than projected!) The first words that come to my mind are impressed. I am very thoroughly impressed with this stand. I have a Thrustmaster TMX Pro setup currently on the stand (TMX Wheelbase T3PA Pedals) with the TH8A shifter. The stand feels incredibly planted with barely any wobble and if there is any wobble it stems from the shifter not the wheel. All in all my only complaint with the stand is that when I installed the floor shifter pieces it turned out to be too skinny of a fit for me to use the stand. If you’re skinny or not very husky this may work for you. All in all very impressed for the price.
5,easy to put together very sturdy i like it alot
5,I race alot and this has done its job well. Much better than having the wheel on the desk. Plus the shifter mount is perfect for a natural feel.
5,I feel like I looked at a thousand different wheel stands from every maker on earth before I chose this one. Boy did I make the RIGHT choice!  The stand is 85% assembled in the box needing only the shifter mount to be installed. The instructions are in fact a joke but they really aren’t needed. This thing is adjustable in every possible way but once you have it set up and locked down it is bank vault solid.  Zero wobble in the V2 shifter mount either which is something I was really worried about. I’m using a Logitech G920 set with this and it works perfectly.  Heartily recommend this stand to all
4,Good material strong feel to it. Would be nice if the fold screws could be loosened and folded instead of taking out completely to fold the stand.
5,I'm very happy with the product.I use it both for my GT wheel and for my HOTAS One joystick.Both fits at the same time.The unit itself is quite sturdy and heavy which is a good thing since it's not easily moves or shakes from the force you put on the wheel or the joystick.In General although not at the high end quality it's still very good for its price point.
5,I got this for my Logitech G923 and its works perfectly. Everything is adjustable and the construction is very solid and durable. About 6 months of use so far and not a single bolt or screw is loose.
5,This is great if you have a living room setup and a dining room chair. Solid hardware and heavy enough not to move around when driving.
3,This piece I bought as a brand new item and when it arrived the package was all destroyed and had been a previous return. Metal all has scratches and wear on it. Build quality is good but product description is not
2,I'm convinced everyone that gave this a 5 star review wrote that within the first 10 minutes after building it. This wheel stand is very wobbly you can adjust the feet to make it more level the issue is the base is too narrow.Every bolt that came with this stand must have been the lowest grade metal they could find because I striped every head.But on the bright side it holds the wheel and if you're handy you could easily make sturdier. If you were thinking this might be a cheap but effective mount for a Thrustmaster t300rs I highly advise against it.. I have a logitech g29 so I imagine it would be way worse with the thurstmaster.
4,Very heavy strong metal stand perfect for sim racing wheels i give ony 4 because of the medium/hard difficulty to set up the stand when the instructions seem to make it a fast and easy setup which is not true in my experience otherwise i suggest getting this for casual sim racing for begginers and affordable
5,This thing has delivered above and beyond all expectations. Easy enough to put together well constructed good fasteners multiple options on how to set up between the two included side/throttle/shifter mounts and the three position angle/height adjustment on the main shelf. Entire unit can fold with peripherals mounted for easy stowing/hiding. Pre-drilled/milled for a lot of different hardware. Logitech G920 pedals and shifter all had matching bolt holes and secured well. I can fasten my X-55 HOTAS after checking the pattern. Would work great for flight yoke throttles and rudder pedals as well. Rarely this pleasantly surprised taking a chance on Amazon this thing is worth every penny!
5,Bought it used to save some additional $.As the title says I bought it as a cheaper alternative for a flight sim rig. The holes are not designed for my purpose. Add some industrial strength velcro and problem is solved. Solid solid. Using it for Microsoft Flight Simulator. Extremely satisfied no regrets whatsoever.
5,This is a great solid and sturdy stand. I bought a g920 and a shifter. I was able to get six bolts in the pedals two in the shifter and two in the wheel. Everything is solid. It's very clean. There are many other holes available as well. The bolts to attach the wheel etc. Are provided. The shifter can be mounted rhd or lhd. It also can be mounted via overhead at the wheel or at floor frame (doubt this will work with seat frame accessory). So four total shifter possibilities and the floor mode allows infinite adjustment. It's very solid. It does have instructions but they are as basic as it is. You don't need instructions it's already assembled except for shifter brackets. Also I use a cheap fold up camp chair and it works great. Eventually I plan to add a real seat but the fold up chair works great.
4,It serves its purpose well. This stand is very sturdy and heavy. I am using it with my Logitech G27 in case someone is wondering. It came with all it needs plus two separate shifter mounts which was the main feature of why I bought it. Unfortunately one of the shifter mounts that I got had holes too big for the screws and will not hold in place making it unusable. Fortunately I am not picky and since the other shifter mount (the "L" shape one) works I'm okay with it.Pros:-Heavy and sturdy-Works with G25 G27 G29 and G920-Two separate shifter mounts for easy switch between LHD and RHD (unfortunately this ended up being useless for me since one of the mounts is faulty)-Relatively easy to assemble even without instructions-No center bar!Cons:-A bit expensive I feel.-Won't fold flat like others if the wheel is mounted. So better have some extra room to put it away.-Tricky to get a comfortable position for taller guys like me (I'm 6'2). Also despite I'm a skinny 152lb guy it does feel a bit tight.-No instructions (although it's pretty much common sense if you look at the pictures)
5,It's durable solid and works great!
5,Best stand for your money. My Logitech g920 wheel pedals and shifter easily connected to this stand. It is a little heavy but that's good as it's durable and sturdy. There are adjustments at every level to suit your height or chair. Very pleased.
5,This is not like other stands I have seen.  This is very sturdy well built.  Made from heavy-gauge steel.It could use some width adjustments for larger users but not difficult to assemble and set up.
5,This is a great product. I am so glad I spent the extra money. I can’t say the cheaper stands aren’t as good but this stand is worth every penny. Super Sturdy and my logistec wheel and pedals fit perfectly. The only negative I can give it is the directions. If you aren’t someone that works with their hands in can get confusing. They don’t tell you what hardware to use. You have to figure it out on your own. It’s not terribly difficult but someone who isn’t accustomed to working with their hands may go through all the supplied bolts and nuts until they find the one that works.
5,Just received this yesterday.  Based on a few reviews I was worried we wouldn't be able to put this together without some yelling and cursing however it was a breeze!  All the hardware was there and even though the instructions are minimal and it doesn't tell you which screws go where it was pretty self explanatory. It's extremely sturdy (although not so heavy that you can't move it around) and was easy to assemble!
4,The stand itself is great very solid feels like very high quality especially for the price.However the assembly instructions...oy. There is a baggie with a bajillion wing nuts and adjustable hand knobs and a pictogram that actually made me wish that the IKEA guys could have done a quick once-over and made it somewhat understandable. I mean I THINK I did it ok it seemed pretty straightforward but I've never been left with this many extra pieces and that scares me a little.It hasn't fallen apart yet so I think it's OK. I'd have liked it better if more of the pre-drilled holes matched up with the wheel/pedal/shifter combo I got for my boys (Logitech G29). Only 2 for the pedals of 6 available holes in the unit one for the shifter. I'm sure that's enough but again having some guidance from the instructions would have been welcome.One star taken for that issue. You won't be disappointed with the hardware itself though as long as you can guide yourself through the assembly.
3,It is very reasonably priced. I wish I would have bought something that is a chair and stand combo or at the very least something that has more options in adjustability
5,My application is for an older Playstation 2 wheel so the mounting hardware does not apply.  The stand comes mostly assembled only have to put shifter hardware together.  Agree with earlier reviews that the instructions are a bit lacking. For example there is no illustration for the lower shifter mount hardware.  The unit is not complicated so most should be able to figure it out.  Nice stable platform for wheel and pedal setup makes play time more enjoyable.
5,Good gift
4,the stand is solid but tends to slip some on carpet when pushing the pedals hard. The rear detachable stand for mounting a handbrake or shifter tends to get in the way of my chair as it is too far inside of the frame. Also the folding for storage is kind of a pain as you have to unscrew the wingnut style screws and hold the weight of the frame with steering wheel up. Other than that it feels pretty solid.
4,Mostly perfect only change I would request would be an adjustment to be able to make it just a bit wider with the arm attachment.
5,Pretty well comfortable good fit my arm and legs use wheels stand height
5,Took a minute or two to get set up properly  didn't know I had to download the proper stuff from logitech.  But it works great
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The feedback from the wheel causes it to move very slightly but besides that a solid 10/10 I would very much recommend.
4,Was very easy to put together. too bad getting the one with racing seat was just to expensive for me. i have the g920 steering wheel and pedals the gear shift and also the logitech side panel attached.  all parts are firmly attached.
3,My order was damaged on delivery.  It's a heavy item.  Several pieces were bent.  I was able to straighten with channel locks and an adjustable wrench.  The scratches that were on it were fixed with touch up pen.Works as expected.  Good build quality and has enough weight not to move under hard braking or over excited acceleration.
4,Update: Customer Service has sent a replacement bolt and I’m currently awaiting delivery. They were responsive and communicative.The stand overall is sturdy and holds the G29 Wheel well.However my stand came with a faulty "easy-to-fasten" hand bolt I was unable to bolt down both sides of the frame and their customer service hasn't responded to my e-mails.
4,You get all the hardware to mount your racing stuff that was unexpected and a real plus. Went together easily which only is a couple of parts..A blind man could do it..what do you know I am commercially blind so that is the truth. You can also purchase additional add ons to make it a full rig!
5,Works great. Easy to assemble. Came with cable ties. Very sturdy. Pre-drilled for mounting. I'm using a Logitech g920 and the holes line up perfectly.
4,As other reviews have said. The set is pretty good honestly. Only complaint is the instructions are complete garbage. Basically is 3 small pics showing where all bolts go.. But.. If you have any common sense. It takes like 10 mins to set it all up.
5,Very well built and does not move when playing. I have a G29 attached and it works great. Dumb mistake on my part not having all of the cables connected to the wheel before bolting it down... Don't listen to these other reviews that say it is hard to set up because of bad instructions. It is super simple and the simple instructions reflect that. A side note this thing shipped from Paisley GB and mad it to my house in four days! Wow! Ordered late Sunday night shipped Monday and here Thursday. Super job by the seller and FedEx!One other side note... This thing is heafty so be careful how you lift and move it around.
4,When using with a Logitech G29 the stand is pretty shaky. Other than that the overall build quality is excellent.
5,There are tons of options when it comes to these wheel stands. I can tell you that this was the best choice I have ever made.Set Up Time: 10 minutesPros: Very durable construction the unit folds into a smaller space saver for storage. It's very heavy which is great for stability when using the stand while gaming. The spacing and angles of the stand are very realistic to a car. Mounting the wheel pedals and shifter was a breeze. The stand comes with finger screws so you can easily mount and adjust to your needs.Cons: It's not a real race car (Oh and it could use some sort of cable management black Zipties will do the job too)Overall: Stop debating between this stand and which ever other one you have opened in another tab. This stand is an incredible choice especially for the price. You're going to be incredible happy with this stand.
5,Better than I imagined it's more sturdy than it look.
4,After 2 years of sliding pedals and moving wheel this thing is rock steady. The ability to add a seat try later on is awesome. I haven't used it much so I can't comment on durability but definitely feels solid.
4,Product was delivered on time. It's solidly made good adjustment options. Only issue is that documentation should be added detailing how to assemble the wheel onto the metal frame before trying to align with the correct screw holes.
5,The media could not be loaded.
5,This is a very solid construction with no wiggle whatsoever once it's in place. It has rubber feet to keep from sliding and the metal is all heavy duty. It has multiple holes for customization. It is also foldable.It was a little bit more expensive than other setups but worth the extra $$'s.
5,Awesome steering wheel stand that comes with two different ways to mount shifter. The way I used mine is mounting both platforms on the right side and used one for shifter and the other for a parking brake lever. Works very great and very study durable.
5,Setup is pretty much common sense I didnt use the instructions at all this thing is amazing! The extended shifter stand is nice but won't work if you have a wider chair the quality is amazing and the amount of adjustments you can make is great for any setup!
5,It is a solid stand using a G29 and fairly easy to assemble. The adjustments for the height make it good to use with most chairs. The included two extra platforms for a shifter and e-brake are nice if you have more than just a standard wheel and pedals.
5,No helpful instructions on how to set up. Once you kinda figure it out though it’s one of the best stands out there. Pretty sturdy and easy to adjust! Would definitely buy again
3,A decent little stand for a wheel. The instructions could be better. The hardware and tools are cheap so be careful to not round off the bolt heads during assembly. It should be bolted down because I move it while racing my son (6) doesn't have this issue. It has plenty of holes for many wheels and adjustments some take time to do though. If you dont have money for an expensive rig this will work well as a starter. Tip:leave extra cord out from the wheel if you are planning on making adjustments for other sized people. Made in China
5,Very solid sturdy quality stand. Made of pretty much a solid metal piece with attachment for stick shift this has all the adjustments necessary. Simple assembly since it is already one piece although the instructions are lacking. Even with its solid construction this stand collapses down as pictured and advertised. Shipped from the UK this got to me 3 days early! I easily and wholeheartedly recommend this product and seller. I use this with a Fanatec Porsche 911 GT3 RS V2 wheel shifter and pedals and everything fit just fine except for my shifter does not have holes to mount to this stand's attachment. I am very impressed with the quality of this product and the affordability makes this purchase a no-brainer. If you have need of a steering wheel stand look no further.
5,Easy to assemble. Highly adjustable. I don’t see myself folding it to store out of the way - with wheel shifter and pedals plus metal construction makes it heavy; I’ll just move it out of the way. Came with multiple optional for shifter placement.
5,Very good
5,Had been eyeing this stand for sometime and decided to finally make the purchase. Prior reviews were spot on in that this is a very solid stand. Fits my Logitech wheel fine but requires a bit of creativity with tie straps to hold the GT Driving Force version in place properly. Comes with everything you'll need to assemble the stand.
5,would recommend if you do not want to spend a large amount for product (with seat) easily assembled mostly together out of the box feared we may have to assemble the whole product bust was pleasantly surprised. Is sturdy and easily assembled
5,Fantastic Product! Stable sturdy and easy to assemble. I finally decided to do things right when I picked up a new Logitech G920 for the Xbox One. After looking at a couple other stands I decided to go with this one. No regrets this thing is the real deal. I'm 5' 11" and 200 lbs and this stand is an excellent fit. My legs don't feel constricted when I use the pedals. GT Omega also offers a rack that attaches to this stand that you can then mount a racing seat on (available on their website). So if you're looking for something to use while you sit on a couch (like me) but offers the flexibility to be modified later on down the road then this is definitely the stand for you!
5,Loved that they included Velcro cable ties and thought the overall quality was very good and it wasn’t hard at all to set up
5,I have to admit I was skeptical about buying something like this without seeing it in person.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It's sturdy and easy to assemble.  Very much worth the price!
5,Easy to set-up... not time consuming at all.STURDY / Excellent look / great rigWorks very well with gaming chair!Exceeded any expectations I had for sure.Great Product. I would recommend it for sure
5,Two fifteen year old boys put it together and were playing very quickly. He loves it
5,Using with G29 stable with alot of ways to adjust it but you have figure some of it out your self. Instructions are basic just a series of pictures. I'm very happy with it.
5,Sturdy and lightweight. Great for someone starting out in the world of sim racing. I have no complaints. It has a simple design and is easy to set up.
5,Great product for the price assembling it was easy and its really sturdy loving it so far.
4,This was a birthday gift for my husband to use with his racing games.  Took a few days to adjust but he seems to really like the setup and having everything mounted on the stand. Wish there were recommendations for best seating to use with the stand so that we could have gotten everything at the same time.
5,Awesome product. No flex or twist. Easy to assemble and affordable.
5,It was good had to return though because racing wheel did not work correctly
4,Works good for what it is intended to do little flex in the pedals.
5,Surprisingly sturdy little wheel stand.  Happy with the product and recently ordered the seat attachment.  Super easy set up.  Great value for the money.
5,Very happy with purchase! Well designed. Made a big difference in my gaming experience.
4,Good material quality thick steel and the only plastic is on the adjustment knobs. Quite hefty but people with wheels that have stronger FFB than my G27 might want to either add weight to it or get a different stand as it does rock about when you yank on it hard. Otherwise its very well made and sticks in place well with its wide rubber feet. Great stand for my G27 and would recommend.
5,The stand is solid.  It has taken the driving games to another level.  I should have done this a long time ago.
5,Bought for grandson he really liked.
5,Well built and the best thing about it it comes 90% set up already. Super nice glad I bought this one
5,I don't know how it is  because  I bought for my son for a Christmas  gift  but I'm sure my son will love it
5,Very well built the set up is perfect the adjustability is great well worth the value great product
4,nice racing stand.  seems very sturdy and well built.  instructions were lacking but still not hard to put together. fully adjustable heavy duty stand.  would buy this stand again.
5,Works great for Flight Sim - very easy to secure the Rudder pedals to the foot panel and the yoke system to the tray. Well Done!
5,I ordered this looking for an easy set up and break down stand for my Logitech g29. This is a fantastic product initially I thought it was a tad expensive but upon fully assembling the stand you can see it features fantastic build quality. While its easy to break down and store there is very little movement in the joints when tightened down. Its a very solid rig I would recommend this to anyone looking for a simple racing setup that they can put away when not needed and easy to set up when you're ready to use it.
5,Stable and well built and it's a very versatile product. I mainly use it for a yoke throttle and pedal combo and works perfectly.
5,Solid piece well made
5,Quick and easy to set up. Worth the money. Everything was like how it was described.
5,Great product. Doesn’t take up too much space so I can store the set up easily when not playing F1 2020.
5,This is a solid wheel stand. Nothing really to complain about.
5,Easy to assemble and high quality components. Works perfectly with my Logitech G920
5,Solid base slides a little but with a decent amount of force.
5,Way more than I thought I was getting. Great rig!
5,Just what I expect and more this was great
5,Solid purchase. I was using a table to mouth my wheel and I thought it was decent. Then I got this and I’m hitting lines like Whitney. Doesn’t move at all while racing. And the tables double as a beer holder.
5,I'm very happy well built excellent value for the price.
5,works great with the Logitech steering wheel pedals and shifter
5,It is the perfect height for real feel racing.
5,Easy assembly!Good material.Very easy to put anywhere!
5,My Son seems to be enjoying it
5,Love it should have bought one years ago!
5,Excellent quality well worth price paid
5,My G920 fit perfectly
5,Great and sturdy product.
5,The stand is very sturdy! The steering unit has matching holes on the stand to secure it with more than the turn knobs that I had to use while on my desk. When gaming time is over it is easy to move the entire rack off to the side and out of the way. Unlike being attached to the desk the rack is adjustable to any height. Great product!
5,Surprised with how quick delivery was. Stand is perfect set up for racing games.
5,Predrilled holes for the pedal platform did not line up had to carefully drill my own. This seems to have been a rare manufacturing flaw. Everything else was more than satisfactory. You can purchase this product with confidence.
5,Excellent product. Very study. Highly recommended
5,Every good review had merit. This is a terrific wheel which makes me wonder why I hadn’t turned to the wholly experience of driving sooner.
5,Great product used the extra shifter peice to hold my chair
5,Heavy and sturdy. Worth every penny
5,Really like the sturdiness and ease of adjusting
5,This steering wheel stand is a necessity if you buy a G920. I saw very limited reviews online before I bought this but am I very impressed by this stand. It is very rigid and is the right fit. I use a folding chair with it and I love it. The shift know is placed at just the right height. Best product at that price.
5,My husband uses it more than the kid!  Adjust to fit a 6’5” man down to a 4’8”.  Great atand
5,My stand is actually better than I thought it would be!  It is very sturdy and able to withstand hours of rally racing usage.It showed up in less than a week... bravo omega!😎PS I know the gearshift platform is mounted upside down I don't have one but... I got lots of cups (n stuff) that need holding!lol
3,Instructions were very vague.
5,Excellent quality
5,Great product better company. VERY responsive to customer contacts and superb customer service.Love love LOVE the setup. I can move it to the side when I'm not using it slide it easily into place when I want it. Sturdy solid adjustable and the steering wheel and pedals are excellent! I could not possibly be happier.
5,Just what I was looking for. Great price. Shipped very quickly and arrived with all the parts and tools needed for assembly.
5,I am glad I waited for these to come back in stock. I am using the G29 steering wheel with this wheel stand and I love it. It even comes with extra parts in case something gets misplaced when adjusting the position.
5,The perfect Christmas gift.  Everything as described and delivered on time.
5,My son wanted this as a Christmas gift. He loves it!
5,This is a very sturdy wheel stand at an affordable price.
5,Yes this is a pretty good stand. Looked at all of them. Very  good if you have small space to work with Very sturdy ran my best time Easy assemble. Everything is adjustable  Well worth the money.
5,Exactly what I was looking for. Good build nice and heavy. Great customer service. I would go with the shifter attachment that hangs from above rather than the one that comes up from the bottom but it's nice having the option. Good buy.
5,I was looking at several stands  purchased the omega for g29 and very very happy I did . Sturdy  easy setup ( not that difficult ) again very happy !
5,This is the cheapest option for a racing wheel stand currently but that doesn't mean it's cheap. There is very little/no wobble while using it and it is collapsible for storage.
1,I ordered this stand for the upcoming racing games. Upon delivery I noticed that the package was taped erratically and there are a lot of missing pieces and tape on the stand.Received an already opened item.DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE EXPECTING A BRAND NEW STAND
5,Great sim racing stand!
5,Very sturdy easy to assemble and adjusts to accommodate a 4 foot tall kid to a 6'3" adult kid.
5,Very solid product I love it!
5,Awesome product.
4,This is a really nice stand very sturdy well made super easy to put together. Like another reviewer I do wish there were some instructions about the bolts included and what they're for as I ended up using a longer one for the wheel base that would have been better for the pedals but it worked out anyway.The other complaint I have is that even though it *is* very easy to disassemble when you want to fold it and put it away it does require that you unscrew the two side bolts fold the unit then screw them back in. I think the Apex stand has a hinge mechanism that is probably worth the extra money. Not a fault of GT Omega but something to consider.All in all this is a great little entry level stand that makes it simple enough to store away when I don't feel like looking like such a huge nerd when friends or family come over and now my desk doesn't shake from the force feedback and wheel usage. Win win! And hopefully more wins to come! ;)Quality unit and it's helpful to know that if you do end up wanting to expand it you can get the rear seat attachment and a cockpit seat... just couldn't hide that away as easily.
5,I'm extremely happy with this product. Before I owned it I was having to clamp the wheel and shifter to my computer table. This caused my monitors to shake violently. Plus the pedals would move all over. I saw many different setup options and this one was just slightly more money then cheaper options. Take my word for it and spend the extra. This is a quality setup. I know many gamers like to use a hydraulic e-brake setup with these games. This was the only thing I was worried about when ordering this setup however after much research I saw that this setup came with 2 different ways to mount the shifter. That got me thinking "Could I use the secondary shifter mount for my e-brake?" Well I'm here to tell you that yes you absolutely can. I mounted my e-brake to the secondary shifter location and it's nice and sturdy. Now I'm able to use my shifter and e-brake comfortably. I will say that if you use the table to put something sturdy behind it to keep it from moving back while you're using this setup. These games get aggressive at times so this is normal and certainly not enough to deduct a star from this review. Everything on this table is nice heavy and and solid. If you're looking for a cheaper mount do yourself a favor and don't. This was only maybe $20 more then cheaper setups and it is 110% worth the extra money. It's extremely well made and stable.
5,Can't go wrong with this stand. For the price  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and sturdiness of this stand. Very small amount of horizontal flex but not really noticable unless your looking specifically for it. Running a thrustmaster tmx.  If you need a portable stand  this will do the trick quite nicely.
5,I have a home office where I work and play my games. I also have three young and aggressive (lol) children. This means the following:1) I need something strong to withstand my three children.2) I need something that I can easily fold up when I need to start work.3) I need something compact so I don't get yelled at by my wife for taking too much space.I posted a picture above and I couldn't be more pleased with this product. It's strong and it's easy to fold up and when it does fold up it takes no space at all. It's great quality and I couldn't ask for more out of this. I have a G920 and it fits like charm shiftier and all. It comes w/ even an E-break extension and furthermore if I wanted to mount my flight stick on it - I can do that as well. Don't get the off brand stuff - the GT Omega - Classic Racing Wheel stand is the one.
5,Sturdy good product
5,I purchased this directly from the manufacturer but wanted to leave feedback here for others. This is an awesome wheel stand for the money. The best part is not having a bar between your legs that prevents switching feet on the pedals. The pedal angle is not adjustable but it is just about right as it is. The wheel angle is slightly adjustable and the height of the wheel and the distance from wheel to pedals is adjustable enough to accommodate most individuals. My biggest criticism is that is comes with Ikea-like instructions and I had to contact support to find out I needed to remove a bracket in order to hard mount my G920 pedals to it. They responded within a day and this is a high-quality stand for $150.
5,i would reccomend
5,This is an excellent stand it is extremely well built sturdy and versatile. It is way better than wheel stand pro and less expensive I returned a wheelstand pro for one of these and am very happy I did. I have actually built an entire racing rig around it.
5,I just decided to get into sim racing and did not want to make a huge financial investment while I dip my toe in. After looking around on Amazon I just felt like there were a lot of the same exact stands with the same images just a different company name as the seller. Most of which seemed cheap and in most cases more expensive than this one.It was nice to see a branded wheel stand with great reviews and at a reasonable price. I decided to give GT Omega a try and I am very happy I did.The stand is very solid! For most users this stand will do the job great and provide a great experience. After 15+ hours of driving I have no regrets on this purchase.Pros- Feels well made and has a good weight- Easy setup and mostly put together out of the box- Lots of adjustments options for steering wheel angle height etc... Peddle angle can also be adjusted- Easy to fold down and move out of the way- Solid floor grips that have kept it in place on my tiled floor- Easy to adjust on the fly (wife was able to jump on with only slight adjustments to wheel height).Cons- Possibly a small con (was hard to really find any real cons) is the instructions aren't super clear on everything. I could see some people may struggle a little but if you take your time and follow them it should be no problem. Again most of it is already put together so there really isn't a lot to cover in the instructions. But you need to make sure you're using the right screws for your wheel etc...- Could be slightly wobbly on the wheel stand if you had a strong motor vibration from your wheel (as I am sure is true for all wheel stands that use this style). Otherwise it has been very sturdy!If you're like me and want a solid wheel stand without coming out of pocket this stand will do the job. You will not be disappointed.
5,I purchased this for my son and he spends hours playing it. Great buy!
5,Well built solid wheel stand.
5,Bought this for my son’s Christmas present. It’s quite sturdy and his Logitech steering wheel/pedals fit perfectly. Keep one thing in mind. You’ll need a good chair that doesn’t roll to get the best use of this system.
4,I didn't want to spend $400 on a fancy stand with a seat because I already had an office chair that does the trick so I picked this one because it was for a lot less and it had no crotch bar which I don't like and I don't regret my decision folding it away is good too but not the easiest to do
5,I love the stand and it really fits with my g29
5,This is one of those products that does not desapoint.  It is very very sturdy with the wheel and pedals is heavy enough to stay in place and not move around. I have a G20 and you can bolt it perfectly and hold everything in place firmly.  Have in mind that if you are planning to do some crazy "Sim driving" it will moves around little bit.  This is agood option if you have to move it around and it doesn't take too much space... For the price this is as good as it gets ...
5,My 9 year old loves it.  I was worried it woud be flimsy but it's very sturdy.
5,I loved that it was easy to fold away into a closet. It would be nice if there was another axis of adjustment to the wheel. Very happy with my purchase.
5,Es un increíble entretenimiento tanto para jóvenes como para adultos !!
5,This is great rig for someone just starting out in sim racing (me) or someone who doesn't want to shell out the kind of money a real race car costs to race a cartoon one (also me). It fits my Thrustmaster T-150 wheel and pedals perfect and I also plan on using it as a HOTAS set up for flight sim as well get a little more bang for my investment. It comes with 2 styles of stands/mounts for a shifter add on. I will be buying another upper frame unit for the HOTAS (as opposed to the one that attached at the bottom/base area). The frame does seem a  little narrow if you attached 2 floor mount ones but you could make it work. It does fold but it's a little awkward by yourself to do so I just leave it set up. Overall I'm very happy I finally got one because I love racing games but the controller thing was not doing it for me anymore. This along with the very good (not great) T-150 wheel makes me feel like I have an arcade in my game room awesome!
5,Compre este kit para poder usarlo con mi ps5 y es genial . Recomiendo
5,Very nice! Works perfect for G923. Also the shifter bracket is pretty dang thick. Would recommend
5,I ordered this for my grandson for Christmas. Iy was one of only two things he asked for. I can't speak for how it works as it will be in the box till Christmas. I can tell you that it came in only two days and is quite heavy.
4,The mounts build quality is pretty good and it's decently sturdy. The shifter plate does wobble though I could've been just sent a bad unit. All of my thrustmaster gear fit on perfectly (th8a t300 base and t3pa pedals) and I had to drill a hole in the upper  shifter plate for my handbrake but that's not a con.Pros - Very small good for storageVERY adjustable.8/10 build qualityConsSuper unsteady if driving hard. You can tip over the whole mount with your pinky finger unless you're just casually driving it's fine but drifting is super unsteady
5,Easy to assemble sturdy and easy to store. Love it!!!
5,Very sturdy and almost everything is adjustable for the perfect setup. The instructions also give a very good diagram of which holes work for the certain type of wheel shifter and pedals. I am very happy with my purchase. Would recommend.
5,The assembly was straight forward and my teenage son is enjoying his driving games a lot more with this set up. It’s sturdy and well made which is important for a kid who is hard on stuff!
5,Very solid keeps everything in place and is heavy enough to not move around when racing. It also seems very versatile with all the extra mounting holes so it should work with a variety of brands. Overall very satisfied with the value.
5,Lots of adjustments is sturdier then the videos online show but only after I put a tool box behind the petals. The problem isnt the stand itself it's all the weight being up high
5,Absolutely amazing experience. Just wish they would get the add on back in stock. Would like to buy a seat and the add on bracket.
5,Awesome
5,Sturdy. That's the most important thing to me. Heavy but portable enough. Not that difficult to assemble. Expect some extra parts that you might not need. Comes with rubber-covered legs that let meput it on my hardwood floors well-thought!
5,I give 5 stars to this because it's a quality and affordable to everyone.
5,Je l’adore!!!
5,Great stand. Sturdy construction. Can adjust for sofa or a chair.
5,shipping wrecked the box but so far works well
5,Loved it sturdy heavy grade metal
5,It works great.  Solid.  Highly recommend.
5,Nice Solid Wheel/Pedal stand!Yes the directions could have been better But it’s not all that hard to figure it out!Mounting the wheel/pedal wasn’t the easiest I suggest 2 people (woulda made it tons easier)And hook up all your cords and cables because it’s a pain in the you know what to unbolt and rebuild… But all in all I can’t complain! 👍👍
5,Amazing product as expected. Great quality easy to adjust height and easy to store when you do not need. And it arrived before time so thanks to Amazon shipping service. Love it and definitely recommend this product👍
5,Went together well and smooth fit the Logitech wheel and shifter as stated.  Extra parts were included that weren't in instructions not sure if they were to modify what is there or go elsewhere?  At any rate it did its job at a good price point.
5,very solid.  if you don't want or have room for a full frame this is the best deal as for quality of build for price.
5,I do not have any complaints - not even about that scarcity of installation guidance that many other users complain about. It comes practically assembled the rest depends on your own equipment.The only recommendation : if you wish to install a shifter I recommend to NOT use that extra-holder at your foot - install it on the side of the wheel
4,A little tuff to figure out how to set up that's the only reason I gave it 4/5. Otherwise it is a very stable support for my Logitech G923 steering wheel pedals and manual stick. With better instructions it would've easily been 5/5. Also the price is great!
1,Not impressed at all very misleading in what’s included
1,Not impressed at all very misleading in what’s included
5,Took a really long time to decide what stand to go with and this one had a good price and great reviews glad I ordered this one and it came super fast set it up really quick instructions weren't great but just needed some common sense everything fit with no issues and am really happy with the unit nice and heavy not cheap thin metal didn't have time to secure the wires but it even came with starps to secure the wiring to the frame great purchase for anyone getting into forza or american trucking  simulator
