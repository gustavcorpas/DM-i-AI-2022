5,Honestly I was just looking for a depth finder for my old boat since I don’t do much fishing I can’t really speak on the fish finder portion of this device .. but the other features are great. The way point gives you a nice piece of mind. It tells you the depth which is very accurate to my tests that I have done. It tells you your speed (which is great on my old boat that only has a tachometer. It tells you battery voltage which is also great to know on an old boat. Also tells you water temp which again is great to know. Has multiple screens split screens. I would recommend!
5,Just wanted to know my depth and speed and for that it’s great!
4,Great for kayak
5,Looks kinda small but it's bright awesome colors make it easy to see!
5,Works perfect and super easy to install
5,Is good one I love it
5,Simple to use accurate and clear readings  great for beginners.
3,Ridiculous!  Unless you install fishfinders / transducers on a regular basis the transducer is going to be more difficult than it could have been. First off the directions are barely there and therefore I didn't put the little black spacer and rubber washer in the transducer since no diagram showed it; so I figured I'll just unscrew the lock nut. No way I couldn't get it out of there using a power tool. I finally used power tool and vice grip holding the threaded interior and it literally broke the end of the long screw stuck in the lock nut. The old humming bird transducer holder was still there so I used that. I had to get a bolt and lock nut from my shed no big deal. The transducer holder is ridiculous. There are these deep holes that make it very difficult to install and waste a lot of your precious fishing time. Why the deep holes I have no idea there is no structural reason I could imagine. I've never seen a dumber design and I've installed 2 hummingbirds on my boats in the past 25 years so it's not like I've never done this before. I chose this product because of it's high ratings. I hope it works better than it's installation. Not happy about losing part of my day because the engineers can't put together a simple transducer holder.
4,Update: upgraded from 3 stars to 4 stars.  Would be 5 stars but I have to keep one star off for having had to go through an exchange. My original unit from Amazon was defective and had power issues.  After a couple of weeks of emails with Garmin and attempts to troubleshoot--including them sending me a new power cable--Garmin did an RMA exchange and sent me a new unit.  I took it out today no power issues whatsoever and it worked flawlessly.  It's nice to know that Garmin does stand behind its product.  See below for the actual review.--- --- --- ---Lots of features in such an affordable package.  I can't imaging boating without it--and I don't even fish.  The GPS is useful and very flexible.  I use the GPS track feature to map the perimeter of the lakes which is super nice to have since these cheap fishfinders don't have charts.  I do a lot of birding photography and this is perfect for mapping my favorite birds.  The sonar also gives me a good idea of where birds might hunt for fish so I mark dense fishing areas on the GPS too. For a while my boat's speedometer was clogged so it's nice to have reliable GPS speed on this unit too.  Other than being useful for discovering potential hunting hotspots used by birds I use the sonar to keep my boat out of trouble in shallow waters.  It is so nice to be able to see what's under the boat and to tell how deep the water is. I probably wouldn't be as concerned if I had an aluminum bottom boat but I have a fiberglass hull--those are not meant to take a pounding so I steer clear of shallows by setting depth alarms.  If I had to do it all over again on the same budget--power issues notwithstanding--I would definitely buy this.  Now that I have had a taste I do wish I sprang a little more cash for a Plus CV unit for the contour mapping feature and for the clear vu radar which looks pretty nice.  And my dream unit is one of those echomap units because they come with charts and have all the features of the striker series but I'm just doing lake boating so I don't really *neeeeeed* charts other than for the satisfaction of knowing I could have them.  Anyway I fully recommend this product for anyone with a powerboat and I am sure I would be just as useful for people who do kayaking too.
5,Easy install. Easy to use. Brilliant display easily visible in sunlight. I have this mounted on my kayak and I love it! Works perfectly.
5,Happy with fact it’s still working since 2020. I’m not to rough on it and always take it inside garage after boating. I like how I am able to turn the ‘fish blurbs’ into actual fish on the settings screen; my nephews love to watch them as they appear like small little goldfish on the puny graph. This doesn’t have a side scan or anything special however for such a low price to receive a color And accurate sounder is definitely a plus. Garmin makes good electronics I have to say. Plus it has a map and tracking that works superb in the San Juan islands this feature is Kind-of worthless in lakes. I rated 4 stars for extra tiny readouts with extra small screen. If it works for a few more years I would rate it 4.7.. still to be determined
4,It is a straightforward machine better depth  sounder than GPS but it does both. I got it foe my tender and it is great for that
5,I have it set up to be portable on my Jon boat or ice fishing and works awesome.  Will pick up a 1:8 oz jig in 25-30 fow
4,Fish finder works great. Easy to navigate and small and compact which works out well.
5,Very happy with it for how I use it (Navigation and depth awareness).  simple and accurate.
4,my initial review was pretty harsh! so its been over a month since I purchased this product. after 1 visit to the bay it wasnt working right at all!! since these large companies no longer include specific instruction manuals due too the high cost of printing them I downloaded the manual. and I must say it doesn't offer much help!! but enough for the average person to figure it out. so after a second trip too the saginaw bay  still wasnt right! I contacted garmin and long story short I ended up doing a factory reset! now it works good. however gps speed is not good for trolling due too the fact that wind speeds and waves have an effect on gps signals. with that being said the speeds are fairly accurate! as for the gps position push the button on the lower right it brings up the location of your current location u can edit it! its simple. when u launch go too that screen and select edit location it automatically saves that location! simply go back to that location click on navigate and it WILL bring u back too that location! im slowly figuring it out....slowly!!! as for me I feel its well worth the money! I have yet too find any flaws with the accuracy of the gps location! it has always guided me back to where I launch or fishin spots ive saved!! just gota mess with it ppl!! give it time and I suggest that u download the full free manual from garmin!!!! note....this is not a chart plotter nor does it have preloaded maps!! just a simple gps....nothing more!! it says theres fish but......im not sold on ANY fish finder showing where fish are!! this unit meets my needs just fine. if all ya want is a fish finder gps combo this is for you!! I highly recommend this product! UPDATE 2018...i just purchased another one of these Garmin striker  4 units cause simply put THEIR AWESOME!!!! i sold my boat in 2017 and the first unit went with it. now i have decided to buy another one simply because i loved the first unit(after i figured it out)! I'm gonna use this one for ice fishing. i ordered the exact same unit as i had previously purchased. i will be using the same transducer that comes with the standard unit simply because there's really no difference. i mounted it inside my shappell bay runner shanty and will be buying a separate power cable so i can use the unit on my snowmobile when out ice fishing! this unit is way underrated(IMO anyway) the last one never let me down! i simply save the location where I'm going out from then when it's time to go back where i started from it takes me back....EVERY TIME!! and honestly ya just can't beat the price!!!!!!!!! love it and HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS UNIT! thanx Garmin for making this incredible trustworthy fish finder gps combo!! and thanx to the seller for getting them both to me FAST!!
5,Great unit.  My boy and I installed it in about 2 hrs (I have lots of experience) an we were on the water marking fish and depth.  Couldn't ask for a better unit for the price!
5,I would recommend this product to others.
4,This depth finder works really well and is very easy to use/set up. I set mine up as a through-hull transducer since I didn't want to put any unnecessary holes in my sailboat. Per the recommendation of some people on YouTube I got a glob of duct seal putty stuck it to the inside of the hull bellow the waterline and jammed the transducer into it being careful to not leave any air bubbles. Amazingly it's able to give accurate readings through a half-inch of the putty and the fiberglass hull of my boat.Battery power: Since I'm in a larger boat I hook this transducer up to its own large (80 amp hours I believe) 12v marine deep cycle battery. On a recent six day long trip I used this depth finder for ~4-6 hours per day and by the end of the trip the battery had only gone from 13.1v to 12.8v. Something you should know when setting it up (they don't tell you this in the instructions!) is that you only need to attach the black and red cables to a battery. Black is negative red is positive. The blue and brown ones are accessory cables for if you want to hook the transducer up to other Garmin devices. One thing I do wish is that the battery connector cables were a little beefier. They're pretty thin and I'm a little worried that they might break. Other than that I think it's a great addition to any boat at a very good price.
5,I bought this for a small jon boat to fish a local lake. I have never had any luck there until I started using this. I did not want a large permanently installed finder because the road to the lake beats anything in the boat to death and I am not great about covering it at home. I installed this in a bag with a 7 AH battery and put the transducer on an aluminum bar that I C-clamp to the transom.  The first day out I was going to fish a bank with some lilly pads and playing with settings  when I saw what I thought were fish a few feet off the bottom. But I was in clear water in the middle of the lake and about 20 ft of water without any bottom growth or structure except a small divit or trench about 3 ft deep. I decided to stop and drop a spinner to the bottom and slow roll it when I got my first hit. A largemouth about 12" long. My first fish from this lake at a place I have been over but never fished because I could not imagine there was anything down there.  I could still see arches down there and about 3 casts later got a second hit just a bit larger largemouth.  I have been back multiple times now and always find a fish or 2 and almost always get a good bite. I have fished this lake with a buddy who has a very very old Hummingbird and it was ok for tracking the bottom but never showed any fish. I think the dual freq along with the wider beam in shallow water really does the trick.
5,I mounted this fish finder on a kayak to use on lakes. It reads very well through the mucky water. Learning how to use the Garmin was easy and fun.
5,Used this with only the provided transducer for ice fishing this year. Awesome. Flasher setting Is great. I mostly used the scanning/scope function. Best of both worlds. You don’t need to spend thousands on a quality rig. And the smaller screen on the base model is plenty big enough. I think it actually has better resolution than the bigger one too
5,Four trips out with this unit on my fishing kayak and four flawless performances.  Great accuracy as far as I can determine.  I'm running it on a 5aH SLA battery and after 8 hours I still have over 11.5 volts even in cold weather so it could possibly last 10 or more hours on that little battery.Operation is very intuitive.  No frustrations at all looking for or changing settings.  Check out 1cast1fish on YouTube for a great series of tutorials on this unit.So far I'm really pleased and having a blast using my first sonar unit after almost 60 years of fishing.
5,Those looking for a DIY battery for the Striker 4. I turned an old ryobi battery charger into the battery supply. I used the older gray/black charger that comes will most of the tool combos. I had an extra one I didn't need anymore. I checked the install manual and the Striker 4 said it can handle 10V-20V. I opened up the charger de-soldiered the pins and put the pins back in place. I soldiered the wires to the left and right side of the pins and made sure to verify ground and power. FYI there are 4 pins that connect to the battery the middle pins are deleted/unused. I hooked up the fish finder and it powered up. Voltage read correctly on the screen. I read that some people had long usage with on 9 Ah lead acid batteries. I think a couple 2 Ah batteries could last an entire day on the lake or a couple 4 Ah to last the weekend. Since I am dual purposing these batteries I never will forget them in the boat nor will they died from sitting in the boat like normal lead acid batteries. Win Win. I plan on posting photos later. This could work with other brand batteries under 20 volts. 18 volts is preferred since the batteries start out at higher than 18 volts fully charged so it allows some wiggle room and will not exceed 20 volts.
4,This is a great fish finder and gps system that I would highly recommend for boaters who travel.  I recently used it for the first time on a 10 mile canoe trip and I couldn't be more happy with its performance.  I was able to plot my course on a paper map to get the coordinates of each leg and then add all the waypoint coordinates into the unit the night before creating a route.The next day on the water the gps unit kept track of where I was how long it would take to get to the next waypoint and how long it would take to get to the final destination.  It also told us our speed which is very valuable for trip planning.I have two boats I use one is a row boat for fishing where I mounted the transducer on the electric motor propeller and a canoe where I mounted the transducer in the hull using a foam mounting piece.  In both cases the fish finder worked well and I love that I can swap the unit between the two.  Note that I use velcro to make the unit swappable between the boats but permanently mounting it would not be hard at all.  The base is very nice and you can adjust it to face any direction.During our trip we were rained on and the garmin had no problems in the rain.  It held up very well.If you just need a fish finder for local lakes and you're not traveling in your boat and you don't need to use waypoints this is probably overkill.  But if you're looking for a great gps and fish finder in one this is a fantastic unit and I highly recommend it.Quick note about my setup I built a battery box to power my charger but I know there are nice little battery boxes premade available that might be more hardy and compact than the one I built.  You will need to explore power options and be able to wire the unit to whatever power source you choose.  I like that flexibility.
4,So far I've used this unit on a few fishing trips.  I have it mounted on a kayak.  Extremely lightweight yet it feels as well made as my more expensive Garmin echo map 53dv.  I am powering it with 8 AA batteries which I made with an AA battery holder I purchased.  So far I've only had it out running for 2 or 3 hours at a time my the battery drain is pretty minimal.  I have not really tried the GPS map feature and I don't really plan on using it that much.  So far I am very pleased with how the unit is performing.  Seems pretty rich in features so far.  Will do more updates once I use it more.  Yes the transducer was included.I've had this unit out several more fishing trips and I must say for the cost and size/weight this unit is a great value.  I normally only go out for maybe 3 hour trips but I'm surprised the AA battery pack I made lasts as long as it does.  I've learned that I don't have to recharge the batteries before every trip (as I said I only go out for 3 hour trips).  I'm sure I would only get away with 1 fishing trip if it were an all day trip.  I will do more updates once I use it more.05/1317- UpdateWell I used it about 2 1/2 months last year and so far I've used the unit 3 times this year before it started not working correctly.  I've had several instances where I had the screen background set to white and the screen all of a sudden went to a washed out gray/blackish color and the screen constantly flickered.  I've had 2 instances of the unit just powering off randomly (fully charged battery pack).I will have to call Garmin for tech support and see if I can send it in for repair.  I've had several/many different Garmin fish finders so I'm pretty sure the cause isn't my error.  I've got a bad feeling I'm going to be without this unit for awhile!
5,perfect for a kayak
4,Easy to install
4,Very easy install. Good size color screen
5,I researched these for a long time and this was by far the Best Buy! I am not really a fisherman so I can’t attest to the fish finding abilities but it seems to be giving notifications etc. I bought it for the depth finding abilities water temperature and GPS. The speed is a nice feature as well. We installed ours using a rechargeable 12v 7a battery in a water proof box (not included—they are available on Amazon). Also used the mini stern saver kit (also on amazon) to avoid drilling into the boat. We have tested the various depths with the kids standing in areas we know and it’s very accurate. Overall this is an amazing product. The Waypoints GPS feature is easy to use and very handy. Can use it to set favorite locations such as launches and marinas and navigate back to them with a few clicks). Especially nice to get back to the launch where your trailer is when it’s dark. I could go on and on about the features. Easy install as well.  YouTube installing this product for ideas on how people did it. That’s where we got the idea. From a guy that did one on a Jon boat. Good luck! Enjoy!
5,Fish find a depth finder for my bass boat
5,Actually I bought this on Amazon as a replacement. I have two others exactly like it one on the back of the boat and one on my trolling motor. The one for my trolling motor is open and water got in around the buttons and it wouldn't turn on. I unplugged it and kept it in the house for several days for it to dry out. It still didn't work so I purchased a new one exactly like the others so that I could plug the unit in and wouldn't have to replace the transducer and all the wiring. After I received it I tried one last thing with the one that got wet. I used a hair dryer to dry out the buttons a little more. The unit started working. Now when I am not using the boat I unplug the head and keep it in the house until I need it again. I will keep this one as a spare in case one of the others go out I can replace the unit and not have to change all the wiring.
4,The unit supplied will not turn on. Checked to be sure there was power (12v) at the cable end that plugs into the unit but beyond that there is nothing else to be done. I can't reach Garmin on a Sunday so I'll have wait until tomorrow but I suspect the only option is to return it. I'll follow this review when I know more.  I spent some more time working on this and discovered a few things. First it can be very difficult to seat the power cable all the way. When reading to the end of the online manual I found the recommendation to be sure it was all the way seated. That needs to be stressed in the installation instructions Second it's very sensitive to voltage levels. I had it connected to an old battery that was not holding a charge well and although the docs say it operates down to 10v as soon as the voltage got down near 11v it shut down. The Humminbird I was previously using gave a low voltage warning but the Garmin does not.  Now that it's working it looks good and is more than adequate for the kayak fishing I'm doing but the manuals could be a little more detailed and include more trouble shooting suggestions.
5,Muy facil de usar muy sencillo practico solo quiero solicitar que se informe el consumo de energia para poder estimar la bateria para usarla una cosa que no me gusto pero es de fabrica es que no se le puedan bajar o subor datos desde un pc o compartir por bluetooth pero esto estaba descrito en el manual de usuario. Pero es un problema del fabricante
5,Nice unit with amazing features for the money
5,First fishfinder so I'm no Bill Dance. Can't compare to other models.I mounted it to my trolling motor... as opposed to drilling it into the hull of my boat. Much easier works well. Knowing the depth is super helpful not only for fishing but for navigating... I only use it at speeds a little above idle... it cuts out if you're trying to go fast....Shows "fish arcs" and blobs of baitfish not to mention the shape and contour of the bottom. I can see the screen easily in full sunlight with sunglasses on... don't know why some folks say the screen isn't bright enough. I run it off a deep cycle battery that I also use for trolling. Worked all day with the trolling motor pulling on battery as well... it also shows the voltage output from the battery which is super helpful.Only downside- the battery hookups are super frail thin wire. I literally crimped them into the trolling motor alligator clips and then taped them up really well. You're going to have to figure something out to keep the wires held securely in place... but other than that everything is great. The directions are easy to follow... they are lacking though as far as the power hookup goes. Just remember red positive black negative.... you're good to go.Still learning the features but has gps speed water temp... all really useful. Can keep my boat trolling consistently at 1.2 mph.Great little unit highly satisfied affordable and works well for my little fishing setup. Will update if it stops working. If no update assume she still works great! I have a feeling it will hold up just fine.
5,I bought this unit to replace a fish finder that lacked GPS. For a fish finder in this price range it is full of useful features.  In addition to the typical sonar related data this unit has waypoint functions and GPS speed data.  After installation I ran a few "out of water" tests in my garage to make sure that it was working properly.  I was surprised to find that GPS speed was not present on the sonar screen.  This was very disappointing.  However after making a call to tech support I discovered that the unit must be placed into the waypoint screen for a couple of minutes and then returned to the sonar screen for the GPS speed to appear.  (This may only apply to testing the unit where it is not receiving a satellite signal). If I had one complaint about the Striker 4 I feel that the numbers which overlay on the sonar and waypoint screens tend to be quite small and can not be adjusted.  Overall I think this fish finder is a great addition to my fishing equipment.
5,Love it. Review follows.First the CONS:Took an hour or two to mount on my inflatable pontoon boat but likely much faster on other boats with standard transoms etc.  Took a few hours on the water to familiarize myself with features and viewed various YouTube vids because the  print and downloaded manuals are not that useful. Trial and error plus YouTube are crucial. Tends to read weed beds as fish (thousands of them lol) and any air bubbles around transducer will seriously degrade data. (Easily fixed by stopping motor and/or briefly increasing motor speeds to clear the bubbles.)Now the PROS:I really love this thing. My local lake has fish populations ranging from 3 feet to 60 feet deep and they’re constantly  on  the move. Skipping the dead zones and knowing fish depth have made all the difference.  I power my unit off my trolling motor battery so I can monitor that as well. Graphics are clear and screen is bright enough to see in bright sun albeit with brightness set to 100%.  First time fishing with it I spotted a large target at 25 feet. Stripped out line to lower my lure and landed 19 pound channel cat.  Don’t know how I fished without it.
5,Nice fish finder/ gps for the money!
5,A great little unit for the price was a great buy. Screen is small but easy to read and excellent clarity. If you looking for a good value with a screen that has excellent resolution this is a good as it gets for just over $100 It also has GPS to mark fishing locations on the lake and you can chart a course to avoid getting lost if you on a new larger lake I think it is a great value a little complicated if your going to be using the GPS function but has a simple depth finder to use with great resolution
3,The unit is great at this price point.  Garmin has to come up with a more robust mount
2,The simulator mode provided in the fish finder is not realistically what you see they show very defined arcs. I have seen very few if any defined arts on my fish finder most of the time it's just a white blob or a line that's indistinguishable from anything else. It is very good at finding the depth of the water temperature and all the other functions are fine it just does not define the fish very well in either the fish mode or the mood using just the arch.
5,I am an electrical engineer with advanced degrees and I have spent a month learning a fraction of the features.  Much of my working career I worked with sonar and radar.  I love technology.  This unit is such an overkill but it can be used for simple functions and is worth the price if just used for the simple features.  I would buy it again and highly recommend it. It will surely please you if you like a challenge.  I keep resetting it to factory defaults when I get in trouble with a setting.  I love the various alarm settings such as minimum depth and anchor drag.  It's called a fish finder but I've never used it for that but it does find fish.  The GPS feature is great. Learning to use it will keep your grey matter exercised which is a good thing.
5,Now that i got your attention!I know there are a ton of reviews on this(Garmin Striker 4 Fishfinder) so I will keep it short.Wow Love this fish finder. Great Price. Easy to use.So happy i could do cartwheels (if i was younger).My buddys getting one. I highly recommend.One of the best things i have got on Amazon!Just buy one and be a happy dude too. lol :)
5,better than I had imagined...ice fishing on Lake of the Woods yesterday.I could tell if I still had a minnow on a bare hook at 31+ feet
5,good fish finder but amazon said it was coming early and then it came 2 days late.
3,this gps fishfinder is working well enough very sensitive to depth reading with tenths of a foot accuracy and the speed as calculated by gps and the fish finding seems good as well.  Weaknesses are the construction details which indicate a limited lifetime is expected when compared to my last uit which had really tight screwed on connectors where these are simple push-in types very small and soft texture and not super tight when plugged in.  They're a little finicky also having a slight chamfer to indicate how to insert the two plugs and the pins are very tiny.  Besides the connectors the way the "head" unit is attached to the pivoting base is very insecure indeed.  It's almost impossible to insert the head unit into the base without disconnecting the holder from the base.  These connections are simply too easily disrupted or separated with very little effort.  Yes the system allows pivoting and tipping of the head unit in the base but everything is very easily dislodged if any effort is exerted on the unit unintentionally or not.  Very easily to be ripped off by a thief if desired.  Lastly the screen disappears way too easily in the sunlight and is invisible with sunglasses on in the sunlight which is not cool.  I have a bimini which affords some shadow and makes the display just legible in bright sunlight without sunglasses on of course but without that bit of shade it would be almost impossible to read.  My old LCD display of back and white may have been archaic but it was a pleasure to read in any light whatever.  So with these caveats the unit works well enough but I'm seriously concerned about its longevity.
5,Perfect for the Kayak angler this unit doesn't have as many features as some of the other models but it does give you a reasonable idea of what fish are below the boat\Kayak. The small form factor works perfectly for me. It is mounted on my pedal drive in between the pedals so I have a perfect view while trolling. I find that the one thing I use it most for is to confirm what my trolling speed is. It also has the standard GPS way points and tracking... I would literally be lost with out it. You don't know how disorienting it can be to be out on the water and have thick fog roll in.  Thank you Garmin!
4,The striker transducer does not fit well on the Scotty mount.  Be sure you have a 3D printer to make your own mount or have some rubber washers handy to fill the space between the transducer and the Scotty mount.
4,I have used this unit now for several months and I am impressed the color detail and ease of installation of this product.  Installed on my pontoon and it provides me everything I need to know from depth time water temperature and even my battery voltage.  Not disappointed.
3,Over 15 mph the depth finder won't read depth and just flashes the previous depth.Programing it is a pain.However it has a lot of options you can adjust and change which is nice but from experience I cant say this is very accurate. At slower speeds out of the dock its great has a good detailed screen options etc key point - slower - under 15 mph otherwise it doesn't read or read true(Any kind of seaweed or grass will confuse it as well...that may be normal  for any depth/fish finder not sure)MPH is accurate to atleast 50Water temp seems to be accurateTo sum it up if you need a fish finder/depth finder and cant or won't get a big nice one this does the job. It works  enough for our 18 ft
3,One of the reasons I got this off of Amazon was to avoid the scared sheep in stores but that is not to be.  I'll need to face the sheep in the auto parts store to get more wire and no connectors came for the battery either.  I've already got a crimper for adding wire and terminal points for batteries so I don't have that expense like some of you might. The directions are worthless.  Not as cheap or easy as portrayed when you factor in the additional components needed and my wasted time getting them.  I have only been able to take it out now once with the less pleasant weather here lately but the detail on the depth finder was impressive and I learned a bit more about a pond I've fished for 20 years.  The GPS is very basic with no maps and not the easiest to learn so I'll be spending more time with YouTube trying to become somewhat competent with it.  The product works fine once you have managed to get it installed with additional materials you are going to have to buy.
5,Ok... So I bought this a little while back and have used it only on the river (usually to verify depth and not so much a fishfinder).  Anyway I broke it after having a couple month.  I was plugging it in (it has small one-way fit only connectors behind it) and I was doing this in the dark but apparently twisted/bent incorrectlyetc.I email garmin support with the issue and explained it to them there.  After about 30 hours they got back with me and verified the issue and asked for my shipping address and told me they were sending a new transducer to me.  They didn't ask to see mine they didn't ask for it back just did what they needed to so they could make the customer happy.  I am very happy with the support I received and will buy garmin products in the future!In regards to the GPS fishfinder.  I'd like to see you be able to map your whole route out and take that route back rather than only be able to map waypoints on the way.  It would make it a lot nicer.  I do like that you can show speed depth etc.  Very nice fishfinder for the cost
5,I dunno half the things this thing can do but it accurately tells me the depth and I can watch my crab pots drop into the sea.  Also shows you the fishies swimming around under you - I’d get it again in a heartbeat
5,Easy to use!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Worked awesome for me in my 2005 Malibu v-ride. I mounted the transducer in the hull of my boat as I didn’t want to drill holes or have it mounted outside of the boat. I used a $2 stick of duct seal from Home Depot to mount the transducer and keep it in place. I mounted it just to the side of the v-drive and about 2 feet forward from the prop shaft hull penetration. Used it at lake powell this summer for the first time and it worked perfect! The shallow water alarm also was very nice to have. Custom display settings allowed for a large readout of the depth. Totally worth the money in my opinion as it saved my prop a few times while on the lake the last 7 days.I don’t use the fish finder but maybe someday I’ll use that part of it.
5,Everything seems to work very well for the price; however it would be nice to have more levels on the Gain side.  When using this for ice fishing it is difficult to see where my line is in relation to the depth of water.  I have the Gain set on high but that doesn't seem to help much. so more levels in the Gain (just three levels now) would be a nice feature to add down the road.  I am just using the standard transducer so my guess is that using the ice fishing transducer would be better for this feature.
5,Easy to use and many functions!!! This little unit is fantastic for ice fishing!!! Have also had it on the boat and it’s been great to me! I like to take it with when on open water where I also hard water fish. This way I can get maps drawn for hard water!
5,This locator is mounted on our pontoon and provides us with the water temp speed depth and shows where the fish are.It is a replacement for an older Garmin locator that had the transmitter destroyed by the winter storage facility. With the price of the replacement transmitter almost the same as the newer models it was time to upgrade to a locator with a color screen.The improvement was immediately noticeable presenting a much more detailed view and multiple view choices. One option I would like to see added would be the ability to increase the text size of the various items on the screen including speed and water temperature.
4,I’m sure it’s a great little unit. But if you’re older like me with older eyes I’d recommend you buying a bigger screened unit.
5,Ice fishing...  Made three holes two for fishing one for sonar.  Using regular transducer just hanging it in water.  Adjusted level with bracket included.  We could follow a worm from the surface to 31 foot depth.  We could see our #8 hooks at the bottom.  Machine predicted a fish every time before we got a bite so we we're ready to set the hook.  Fish alarm didn't work for bottom fish but dual zoom made it so we had a good view of the bottom and could see when they were rising for our lines.  We could distinguish which line they were after by depth.Very accurate.  Little noise on screen.  Amazing for the price.  I was worried about the transducer not being ideal for ice fishing but I have no need for anything better.7ah battery lasted 8 hours from 12.5 to 12.0v.Lightweight sturdy and very flexible mounting options included.  Ability to mark location is handy too.
4,Very happy with this unit. This is my first foray into fishfinders so my experience is limited.  (the old method of fishing with dynamite is apparently frowned upon)  There are lots of good and bad video's on the web explaining how to interpret these things and their technology is endlessly touted as a "game changer that will revolutionize your fishing experience". With all the marketing hype I thought I would start with an inexpensive unit and this was a good choice with many many positive amazon reviews. So far I like it.When the sonar technology lawsuits wash out I will probably upgrade next year to downscan and a bigger screen.Mounting: I did not want to punch holes in my pontoon so I converted mine into a portable unit. The head bracket is hot glued to hard foam that fits into a cup holder on the helm and powered by a 2200mah 3 cell lipo. The transducer is mounted on a fiberglass pole that attaches to the pontoon fencing via Koala clamps. Simple and easily removed.
4,I replaced an older model Hummingbird with this transducer and I am pretty much impressed so far. I don’t think it shows the fish as well as my Hummingbird did but then again I may not have the settings exactly right (I just installed it on my pontoon about two weeks ago and only have used it twice). However I do really like all the features and the color screen.  I think it will be a good unit once I figure everything out.
5,Kayaking with this is awesome it’s out of your way and very easy to use even the set up is easy worth the money if you like kayaking and fishing
4,Once we got it going. BIG PROBLEM - No manual included and the online manual was not terribly helpful.
5,Exceeded my expectations
4,I have two kayaks one pontoon and one jon boat. This product makes it possible to switch between all four watercraft with one portable lightweight fish finder. I made my own YakAttack Cellblok to mount the Striker 4 and the YakAttack Switch Blade. The one thing I would change is installing a quick disconnect going to the transducer making it possible to use a shorter cord. That was the only reason I could not give a 5 star rating.
4,Not certain about tech support but some directions for set up would have been nice.  They included four different booklets with this fish finder and not one of them talked how to connect this thing up to a battery. A YouTube video from other customers simply isn’t acceptable. Paying to have someone install a $100 fish Finder also not acceptable.I can learn how to connect the transducer to my boat in five languages though!In the end my husband and I eventually got it figured out after an argument a trip to Lowe’s and another $15.It’s a good (maybe even a great) product - I’ll find out once I get it in the water.
5,Great unit for price it does have split screen ability.  Wish I still had it instead of the Hook I got with new boat.
4,Paired this with a Nocqua pro power kit and mounted it on my 12' Jackson Cuda.  It's my first fish finder so I have nothing to compare it to but so far I love it.  It's easy to view and easy to navigate.  The fact that a roughly $100 fish finder has temperature speed depth AND GPS is incredible.  It's perfect for a kayak.My only critique is that my unit seems to struggle in shallow water with a soft bottom or mossy conditions.  In depths below 6-7 feet especially in muddy conditions the Striker 4 loses the depth measurement.  All other features work great but depth just goes to either a flat line or blinks the last depth it measured.  It's essentially a moot point because I don't need a fish finder to tell me I'm in shallow water.  I want depth to show me structure drop offs ridges etc.  Beyond 6-7 feet it's dead accurate.
4,Rather than rewrite the whole review look at my review forhttps://www.amazon.com/AQUOS-35-5inch-Saltwater-Freshwater-Brushless/product-reviews/B08CS8DYH7/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews .I mounted this transducer on that brushless trolling motor.Worked great within the limits of size and capability.Particularly interesting was the durability and ease of mounting the transducer on the trolling motor..I got a whole lot of real time testing in fast turbid water where you had no warning of underwater obstacles..Impressive mount....
5,This works great on my Sea Eagle 285fpb inflatable boat using a Brocraft adjustable transducer clamp-on bracket.  I can run it all day on my ChromeBattery 12V 7AH- SLA battery.  I haven't tested all the bells and whistles yet (GPS speed routes etc.).  I simply turn it on and use the default settings - it just works.  Sensitivity and detail are really good.  I highly recommend getting the Garmin plastic screen cover for it to protect it during rain and storage.  My only complaint so far is the screen can be difficult to see under the sunlight.
5,By far the best finder for your $$. Ease of use reviews and the fact it has mph are just afew of the many reason I bought this for my kayak. If any one looking for the best fish finder for a kayak I would not hesitate to recommend the Garmin Striker 4
5,Love it. Got mine within 3 days. mounted it on the back of my port side log of my pontoon boat. I needed to buy Split wire loom convoluted tubing and mounting cable clamp with screws but other then that it came with everything I needed. install took me about 1 hour. I spent all labor day weekend on a very large lake. I don't know how i would have managed without it. I was told about a spring on the other side of the lake. using my Navionics app i found that if i headed 182 deg. south west i should find it. My Garmin took me right to it 8 miles away. No way i would have ever found it without my Garmin. The wife and I stayed until dark and use the waypoint to get use home. It saved us more then once. The next night we went out to watch the sunset and the striker brought use right back home. Great fish finder/GPS for a great price.
5,All I wanted was a depth finder to put on my trolling motor.  I was surprised the price was good and I ordered it Thursday afternoon and it came on Friday morning that was a good surprise.  My grandson helped set it up and I used it Saturday afternoon.  It worked great.  It gave me the speed depth time of day has other features that I might not use.  Also was very easy to read for as small as the screen is.  I am very happy with it and I would recommend it to anyone.
4,Will not work after I had a professional wire my boat for it.  Gets power but cant seem to get the unit to start reading the correct depth.  Frustrating  Had Grandson who works as a programmer and writes programs but he couldn't make it work???  He followed the instructions but never got it to work properly.
4,Mounted this on my Moken V2 kayak. It’s exactly what I was looking for a good basic depth finder and sonar. Very easy to install.
5,Wired to rocker switch panel(also Amazon) and mounted transducer on transom of my aluminum. Game changer!
4,I was in the market for just a simple low budget fish finder just to watch/find the depths of the waters.  I haven't really been using a fish finder until this which is my first fish finder purchase.  With so many different choices to make for around $100 I find this to be one of the best seeing that this has more to offer than others.  Very nice color built in GPS can mark your favorite spots shows speed time depths.  Has a down scanner for direct under the boat or ice fishing but I haven't really used it for that yet.  Comes with transducer to mount on boat or trolley motor.  Only downside (-1 star) to this is that you have to go online for the manual.  Can be a little confusing but takes a little time to get used to and figure the functions out.
4,Ease of use for finding fish!
4,You cannot load depth maps onto this unit or use it to map the bottom. The GPS is just a blank white screen with your lines of travel on it + waypoints. The model $20 more expensive has the contour mapping feature. Otherwise it is very customizable as far as sensitivity/gain 77khz or 200khz chirp vs no chirp and the color options are good. Seriously upgraded the jon boat.
5,This thing is frickin awesome! Ounce I turned this unit on an saw all the gizmos it has I said sweet baby Jesus honey get out the frying pan cuz this things going to catch us a whole lot of good eatin!!!
4,This thing is great.  I have a Colorado inflatable pontoon float tube.  This this is the perfect size for what i use.  The only downside is it drains the battery fairly quickly. If you plan on being on the water all day with it and a trolling motor get a second battery.
4,I had been using an old black & white Hummingbird. Frankly I only used it for depth and not really for finding fish. Going to this Garmin was a HUGE improvement. I am amazed at how well it works.  Very pleased and I am still learning it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that when you power it off you have to press and hold for a while. If you forget and press quickly it brings up the option to dim the display. This is easy to do and next thing you know you have a display that is darkened and you have to blindly figure out how to correct it.  I had some extremely frustrating moments on the water. Do it once and your much more careful after that.  However that should not take away from  the great performance of this unit.
5,It was everything we wanted plus some!
5,Hard to beat fish finder! Used it on my fishing kayak and great. Also has a plotter for the price. Best small package fish finder.
5,I bought this mostly for the depth finder as we tend to go in shallow areas with our boat.Installation  was a breeze.  Didn’t really come with very detailed instructions but really the pictures says it all.On our first trip depth finder worked great at all speeds. I set the shallow alarm at 4 feet and it let me know a few times when I was in the shallow areas of the bay.The screen is not that big but the color and brightness were easy to see in full sun with sunglasses on.And the fish finder worked great as we came across a school of fish in the bayou (probably mullet) and a “big fish” as described by my girlfriend (don’t know what that was lol).Overall I am very satisfied with this product as it fits what I need and at a great price.
5,Dropped in the water and still works. Easy to use perfect for my kayak
4,It does the job.  Transducer works well even when installed shoot-thru-hull style.  I knew the screen was small when I bought it but split screen mode is a little harder to read than I thought it would be and it's nearly impossible (for me) to interpret split screen while in motion.  I also don't like that I can't install maps which I didn't know at time of purchase (my fault for not doing more research on it).  It's also annoying that the default low water alarm is set at 20'.  Every time I get in the boat I have to reset it (I disconnect the unit and bring it inside after each use).  For a very basic GPS and fish finder it works and it's cheap.  If you're expecting more spend more money.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 It was easy to put on my kayak.  Still getting to know the settings.
5,I've been using the Garmin Striker all winter as an ice fishing flasher rigging the transducer to a hollow rod wrapped in in a piece of float noodle. Works great. Way cheaper than traditional ice fishing flashers. So for that purpose alone it's worth the price. Need to wait for the warmer weather to try on my kayak.
5,I mounted this on my trolling motor as seen in the instructions however I might consider mounting this on the boat instead to better hold it in place. It reads accurately and is very easy to setup/use.
5,Purchased this item for a friend. Easy diy install. Intuitive access to features. A good buy.
4,We bought 2 of these and hooked them up one works fine and the other onedoesn't show the fish set it up just like the one on the front of the boatbut the 2nd one just doesn't do exactly right. To much trouble to take it allapart and send back so we just deal with it!!! But the graphics are good and myhusband only cares about the water temp. depth. We haven't used the GPS becausewe know where to go and fish been there plenty of times. Clear screen and nicecolor.
4,I've only used it for two runs so far and I like it.  It's a great unit for the price.  Installation and startup were simple and it's relatively easy to use.  The GPS mount is a little wonky but seems like it will be OK.  The only negative I have to share is that I don't like the plastic mount that came with the transducer.  It seems a bit fragile and would have liked to have a metal mount.  I can see having to replace that at some point.The screen is really clear and easy to see in the sunlight.  The functions are all easy to access and I like the vertical profile as opposed to horizontal because this unit doesn't take up so much space on my already too-small dashboard.
5,Works way better then we expected for the price. We highly recommended. He haven’t caught fish all season fist time out with this fish finder we caught 4 very big fish… again highly recommend
5,I bought this to add to my boat's stern so I could see it while running the kicker motor.  I have a Humminbird Helix 7 up front.  This little unit is fantastic and the signals do not interfere with each other.I bought the cover as well to protect it when not fishing.  I mounted it with a piece of aluminum channel 2x1 inch with two pop rivets.  This really works nicely.Throw out the fuse holder immediately.  It is pure junk and will come loose on its own and un-power the unit.  Get a better fuse holder or like I did wire it into a 30 amp breaker and don't worry about it ever again.Great value in this unit and the screen is crystal clear.  Registers fish perfectly.
5,Hands down best budget fish finder i have ever used. I use it on a job boat and have no complaints. Very accurate in deep/shallow waters as far as i can tell. The amount of detail you can see on color fish finder vs black and white is AMAZING! GPS comes in handy for marking hot spots and marking the dock you used to get in the water so you don't get lost trying to get back. CHIRP is also a game changer. The two things ill never go without again is CHIRP and color! This is a great budget unit.We mounted it to a removable stand to take off boat when not and use and to switch between boats. The stand was a great purchase!!
5,A great fit for kayak fishing and very reliable.
5,This product is great. I bought it for my friends. My friends like it very much and will recommend others to buy it.
4,I purchased this and didnt realize that it not only is not a chart plotter but doesn't have any maps at all.  It will record your tracks however so you can mark your spots.  I think I will be upgrading to a chart plotter in the near future.
5,Great investment. Good on the water the graph got wet a couple times and still works great. Easy to read if you know what you’re looking at
5,Be like me and buy it! Stop thinking about and do it! It was so easy to mount that my I had my sisters kids do it! Saw another angler with the same one the 1st time I took it out! Best bang for my buck!
4,Very simple and intuitive interface. It works just as I had hoped. However there are two points that seem to be glossed over at times. First this unit has to be connected to a 12 volt power supply such as a car battery or one of those car battery booster type units. So if you plan to use it in a kayak you need to plan for a power source. Second the screen/keyboard unit is not water resistant at all. If there is a chance of rain or spray you need a ziplock bag or some such to cover the thing.
1,Worked for a few months then started shutting off for no reason and would not turn back on. Sent it back and replacement did the same thing. Checked all wiring and confirmed unit was getting power and ground. Replaced power lead and still shuts off for no reason. Tech support on hold for 5 to 15 minutes every time I called.
5,Fishing.
5,For around $100 i thought well this cant be all that great but i didnt care and tried it anyways. Wow!  Amazing color seems very accurate easy to use and navigate.  I only use it for depth and get a kick out of seeing fish but theres more options to it i havent used. I had a marina install it and they said it wasnt hard typical install whatever thats worth.
5,The installation was easy and quick.  The GPS is fast and accurate.  The depth sounder several time saved me for hitting rocks and bending the prop.  The GPS/Sounder paid for itself on the first trip.  So far I'm very happy with this little unit.  I installed it in a 19 foot SeaRay Sorrento boat.
4,It works great 👍
5,A wonderful fishing assistant of a famous brand.
5,Easy to use works perfect for navigating lake and finding fish!  Fish on!  Caught 7 in 2 hours my first day out with it!
2,Needed to replace the screws washers and spacer for the transducer. They said that I would have to order the bracket accessibly because the screws don't come separate.  So I agreed and when I got the e-mail to confirm the order it was $10.86 which was reasonable BUT shipping was $11.00 more that the order. Needless to say I squashed this order I will have to see what I fashion up to work. Not going to order this again!!!!
4,So far its everything I hoped and more for the price.  I haven't used it much (boat troubles) but the times I have used it I have enjoyed it. I love having the speed on the screen.  The locator works well I didn't really try too hard to get the transducer positioned and it never looses bottom. The gps portion is a little lacking (no maps) but I didn't expect much for the price it allows me to use and track to way points which is just fine as the lakes I fish on I know pretty well and I sure can't get lost on a 200 acre lake!  Great product at a fantastic price.
5,Works great. Perfect size for my smaller boat as it doesn’t take much space and easy to remove when not in use.
5,Everything as I expected!  Very accurate and easy to use.  Even in the bright sun its easy to read.  I use a 7AH sealed lead acid battery and I get about 18 hours of battery life while using it at its max.  Perfect beginner fish finder at a great price!
4,Works well but not that easy toprogram
3,Sometimes I have to power it off and power it on a number of times for the screen to come on full power. Frustrating. Otherwise it seems to be a great product.
5,My son loved this depth finder.  He's used it for ice fishing and on his 14ft boat.  Works well and is fairly easy to use.  Saw fish on the depth finder caught fish in that spot.  Can't ask for more except maybe an automatic fish cleaning option :)
4,So far I’ve had this for a little over a year. It has been a great easy to use. I find myself turning it on even just when going out with the family simply to check clearance. Have done some good fishing with it. Would recommend it for a inexpensive option. I didn't give it five stars because I would have liked a better stand for it.
4,I use this mainly as a depth finder while driving. Really shows what’s under boat good.
5,It marks fish and keeps an accurate depth measure. Good mph reading also.
5,Just to be clear there is no chart data that comes with or is available for the GPS. That being said it's an awesome unit for a very low price. I know the waters I operate on very well but I like to have a plot line in case of heavy fog or out after dark. This fits the bill perfectly. You can drop waypoints and make tracks to be saved and referenced. I tracked down a flush mount kit from gander mt so I could mount it in my dash. I use it for I lad protected waters but it will work great anywhere even off shore. But again do not expect chart data (such as buoys markers land anything). I'm going to buy two more this year for my other boats. Highly recommend.
4,I really enjoy using this fishfinder. Installation of the transducer into my wooden transom was a breeze as was the mount plate for the fishfinder unit itself. I'm sure this is a common gripe when a myriad of larger devices exist but the screen is rather small. I didn't seem to have visibility issues I just wish it had at least an inch more horizontal view space. This would score 5 stars if I was installing it on a kayak.I found that the depth reported was very accurate and it produced a reasonably clear report of the scan area. Great product but I will be looking for an upgrade.
5,I researched and researched on fish finders and which would be the best bang for my buck! This one is great. My husband was surprised and he loves it. It was easy to mount and easy to use.
5,Great entry level fish finder a lot of options for price
5,Great product. Second one i bought and no issues at all. Love it for the function and value.Great features too. It could track fish better but all in all its great for the money.
5,Would recommend it👍🏽
5,I am Happy with this purchase. If you need a good easy to use fish locater with a lot of the bells and whistles.
5,I really like this unit. I bought it to replace two of my old failing units one GPS for speed and tracking and the other was a fish finder and depth. This has it all and at a very good price. One thing I want to mention download the owners' manual to your phone and read it. The first time out on the boat I accidentally pushed buttons that dimmed the screen so much it appeared to be no longer working. I had to wait until I got back home to get my display back. The only docs that come in the box are a quick start guide and the transducer's mounting instructions. The quick start guide has information for downloading the full manual.
5,For 100 bucks this thing rocks! Accurate depth & fish readings even with transducer barely in the water. Screen easy to see even in the hawaiian sun. Mounts up strong & held up to getting soaked on the side of my kayak. Connected this baby to a DBpower lithium jumper pack & it will run all day! 6 hours fishing constant on only pulled 20% of the power pack. Thanks!
5,Works great for my kayak
5,This fish finder is really easy to use.  I set it up on the trolling motor with a metal bracket rather than use the plastic one provided.  Really nice screen.  Probably saved my butt when I was approaching some really shallow stained water and the Garmin was showing me a little over 2 feet.  I screwed the base onto a couple of pieces of wood about 14" square and about 2 1/2" thick.  That way I can move it around in the boat.  Really nice system for the money and extremely easy to use.
4,Garmin siempre sera un referente si de tecnologia GPS se habla pero creo que no deberían de sacar tantas variaciones de un mismo equipo solo nos confunde y evita que las actualizaciones sean mejores.Pero como siempre tiene mi confianza total.
4,the brightness has a tendency to lower it self and appears to be shut off.  love the gps not sure if it's my transducer that is causing broken up images on the fish finder.  It worked fine on day one so i'm sure it is my silicone fastening of the transducer to the hull.  I'm gonna work with it.  i believe my issues are me not the product.  other than  that i look forward to getting more familiar with what looks like a simple to understand operation.  Love the price and i'm pleased.
5,Works great I’m still figuring it out nice that it tells temperature and speed too.
4,This is my first fishfinder but I found it works pretty well shows where the fish is and such. I mounted it on motor itself. 4 stars because the description should say "don't be cheap spend 60$ more and get the ClearVü one". My understanding is that those are more for scouting the right spots on water. First time I took it out and mapped the lake I found out that eventually I ended up where all the locals are clustering so its obviously working...Otherwise very solid there is fish where it says it is shows the profile weeds and ground.
5,It’s small but perfect for my 13’ aluminum. Night and day difference from my older hummingbird. Price was definitely my deciding factor in buying a sonar I wanted more features and bigger screen of course but this little unit had just enough bang for my buck. Very happy with this purchase.
5,I liked the product
5,It works so well and is so easy to use install and I'm so happy we got it. It shows you where the seaweed is it gives layers sized marks and really is great!
5,Unit was easy to unbox and setup.  Manual is downloadable from Garmin and is straightforward to understand.  What was particularly great about Garmin was the customer service.  On my first day of use I accidentally lost part of the universal mounting bracket over the side of the boat and down to the bottom.  The customer service tech at Garmin was able to understand the part that was missing and arrange for a replacement part to be sent out straight away.  The tech was knowledgeable and easy to coordinate with.  Great customer service and a very appreciative customer.  I'll make sure I don't take my butter fingers out fishing with me next time!!
4,Why not support more languages such as Chinese
5,Perfect for the boat
4,Easy to navigate layout. Nice and bright screen.Basic GPS and zoom functions. The GPS is basic and could be a little better with today's tech. That drops it down to 4 star.I wish they had a function where you could make a single display full screen like depth or speed. That would be nice.Screen is also a little on the small size if you are trying to read at speed.
5,Have used Lowrance for kayak fishing for more than 10yrs.  Have had continuous issues with Lowrance too much negative stuff to describe on this review.  Read a bunch of positive reviews on the Garmin Striker 4.  I am quite pleased with the Striker 4.  Its easy to set up and navigate to your particular fishing liking.  Its suburb and responds quickly when depths change rapidly.  Will buy again.  Thanks Garmin for this excellent product - perfect for my kayak.
5,This was fairly easy to install and the price was great.  I would suggest if your not handy and don't know anything about electronics get someone to install it for you.  You need to put screws through the stern of your boat and seal it with caulk. Than run the wire to the front near your steering wheel and connect it to an electric source.  The Garmin Striker 4 is an outstanding product at a great price.
5,Use on my 14’ canoe with a trolling motor attached zipping around the small lakes with this set up . Who could ask for anything more absolutely love it thank you highly recommended
4,After a while and not even that long the depth reader took way long the gage the bottom (200 ft +).
5,These are great super handy. We use ours for our Four Winns power boat
5,The dept finder is great and exactly what I wanted. I bought two of the batteries and that was a mistake. I just have two more batteries to charge. The batteries worked fine but just more work to get ready to fish.  Attached the Garmin to my boat battery and all is well.
5,Got out on the lake first time with this and could barely see the display all I could read was depth. Got back to camp and adjusted brightness from 60 to 80 still not enough but I could see to change it more I brought it up to 90%and that works. I looked on line for a sun shield but they didn't have one. Garmin needs to offer one because this is used on small open crafts with no sun protection
5,I bought this for when I went i fishing it worked great and now I can use it with my kayak. Very happy I can use it all year round
5,My cousin suggested I buy this because he loves his. I have to agree. Lots of options but there are great informational videos online.  Works Great at a great price!
3,This gps is not accurate. Took it on my buddies boat and my gps points were about 800ft off from what his gps points show. I checked it against Google earth gps as well and the points were off too.Update: my gps came with presettings for a european system datum. After looking through the settings i changed the datum to NAD83 and now the spots are in line with Google earth. Double check your datum setting before use
4,Seems to work good but no instructions included. I’m getting better with it each time but I’m no tech wiz either. Good product for the $.
4,Good little axillary unit but for the price a protective cover should come with it.Per Garmin the power cord is undersized. They say it is 22g but even with the insulation my gauge meter won't get 22. Guess that is why they include disclaimer that is not to be used as a primary navigation device when they have your life hanging by a thread.Hope Garmin gets this. I told them this on the telephone when trying to get a heavier cord and it was like talking to a stop sign.
5,I bought this after reading reviews and recommendations to replace a Lowrance Elite 7 on my Kayak.  This is all you need for a kayak...the resolution is much better than in the photo's in the description.  No reason to spend $400. Go for it!
5,Easy set up and a very nice unit
5,Got it hooked it up took it out on my 12' inflateable boat. This fish finder worked great 1st time out simple layout of controls easy to navigate the menu and get right to using. Another feature i liked is it shows me the battery voltage so I knew the battery condition with my trolling motor running. Really happy with this purchase and it has a great price point. No rating on tech support because I havent used it.
5,Absolutely love this thing. I’ve used it for over a year and have yet to have a bad thing to say. Best fish finder for your money. I did have to get a mount for the back of my kayak but it was also inexpensive
5,I have this installed in my little 10ft inflatable hypalon. The hardware screws nicely into the wooden bench and the unit comes on and off easily for putting the boat away. I then took a 2x4 and attached the transducer to one end and have a C-clamp holding it in place to the top of the transom to avoid drilling into the thing. It's already taking on a 15hp motor with a 8hp max rating! (It's a 2 stroke) I event painted the 2x4 to look just like my transom. Now I'm able to fish like a baws. Low power drain by the way.
5,I am mainly using this a a depth finder and looking for submerged rock piles and structure.  Not using the unit to locate fish currently.  But it does have that capability for when I do want to use it.  Love it for my kayak.  Can mount it out of the way so it doesn't interfere while I am paddling.  Large enough to read the details on the screen from 3-4 feet way from me.
5,Very easy to use. Great display and.  accuracy for price
5,Bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it. It was the perfect size for his console. It was easy to install and use. So far it was a great purchase!
5,Installed this fish finder on my 2002 Fourwinds Freedom 170 and work great we are very happy with this product only down the keypad don’t have backlight you can see the buttons at night but other that that really happy
3,hard to complain for the price but definitely an entry level device. U wanted it for my kayak but didnt want to spend a lot. This was fine for a season but if you're like me you'll want a bigger screen and more features rather quickly. Going from no fish finder to this us a big upgrade but it left me wanting more and i upgraded to a 7" with maps after the first year
5,Can’t go wrong with a Garmin unit. Not much to say but I love this unit on my boat. Great instructions and fairly easy to install. Really nice unit for the price.
5,Screen was on dim and could not be seen in sunlight. Found a tip online that alternating off on switch cycled screen brightness now there is not a problem. Default should be on bright and then one can change settings to suit.
5,Great unit. Easy to use provides the info I want. Cant go wrong with it.
5,I have used this exclusively on a kayak. It is great entertainment and helps locate the fish. Now that I have it I always take it with me. I do like the portability of it.
5,Like and use it on Chamberlain Lake ME
4,Purchased for my cousin he loves itWorks well I didn’t realize how small it wasBut it still does the job
5,Whatever I like most about this unit is the ease of operation.  It has so many functions packed into a really small and compact unit.
5,Fast shipping. It has a lot of features for such a small price including heading bearing to waypoint water temp gps speed in statute miles or knots distance to waypoint eta to waypoint current time and ofcourse depth. I cannot speak as to the accuracy of finding fish as I use it solely for depth and navigation. I wish I had bought it a long time ago. One tip for anyone with a fiberglass hull: Bury the transducer in silicone at the bottom of your hull and avoid drilling holes in your boat. It is a cinch to install.
5,see headline
5,I lost my other Garmin Striker during a move researched other depthfinders and decided to go back with a Garmin I mainly fish inshore and nearshore waters so I can’t justify spending 500 plus on a plotter but I will say the GPS is accurate and very simple and useful. Marking a spot is very simple and when you are running in unfamiliar areas the GPS “breadcrumbs” comes in handy when finding your way back to the ramp! The sonar is very easy to use simple and accurate.
3,When I try to turn the unit off it takes 2 pushes on the on / off button and the second button reduces the back-light brightness to night mode. This causes to reduce the  light the next time you turn the device on. The images are not visible in daylight conditions hence you think there is no power. The default lighting should be brighter every time the unit is turned on. Poor and inadequate programming and testing.
5,I absolutely love this unit. I'll definitely be ordering a Icefishing transducer for this next ice season
5,My husband and I have been using this model on our small flat bottom boat for a couple of months now and it is amazing. Great bang for your buck! Would definitely recommend
5,Within hours of product delivery I was out on the water. Even though it is spring it is still cold like winter but it felt good to be out. Great product Intuitive and easy to install. Word on the water is the fish are nervous. 😁🎣  good news for the fish I let about 95% of them go.  And just a friendly reminder to be on the lookout for the phantom dirt bag! He or she has been leaving their garbage behind for years and I never seem to catch them in the act.
4,Worked about 5 day trips in last month of use then went dead-nothing-will not power up. Tested power to the end of plug 12volts boy will not turn on!  Contacted Garmin by email NO RESPONSE. CALLED GARMIN NO ANSWER.  so far a piece of crap as Garmin will not even answer a repair inquiry!!Update: Garmin got back to me via email with solution. Was very helpful and corrected problem (my error).Highly recommend this product.
5,I use this in my kayak and it is the perfect tool for this application. The sonar is accurate and the transponder works through the hull. I mounted it with putty. I will update my review after using the flasher ice fishing this winter. I mostly use it to find depth and bottom. I think it finds fish too.
4,Great little gps and depth finder. I installed this on my jet ski and love it. It is water resistant it has been splashed multiple times without any damage so far. If gps had maps this would be a five star product.
5,Awesome depth finder! Easy to use and it’s right on point when trying to find your fish!
4,I knew buying this that it didn't have any charts but I just feel like we should have had the option to buy a module or something if we wanted to add it for our region.  Not a fan of the power cable and transducer connections at all.  If you don't want need or desire that (maps\charts) then it is a 5 star device all the way.  Fired right up out of the box....mount is decent but all plastic.
4,I've only had the opportunity to take it out on the lake once but it worked very well especially for checking depth. I did not mark many fish but they showed up decently when I did. I did not attempt to use all the functions on this unit. I still think this is a good unit for anyone but especially a novice like myself.
5,Nice product just have to get it figured out
5,I put this unit on my pontoon for depth reading and GPS tracking. It was very simple to install and performed flawlessly.  I highly recommend it
5,So helpful
5,I like the upright mounting position for my application.Works well.  I do not use it for fishing but for depth detection and warning.Have not used the fish finder functions.Good buy.
5,Great value for a fish finder!  Was easy to mount the transducer and the bracket to hold the unit.  I would recommend getting the Transducer mounting plate if you don’t want to drill into your hull.  Works great and the instructions are clear.
5,I love this amazing Farin fish finder. I read many reviews and decided for this one. And within my budget. Its looks great on my Sun Dolphin Sportsman 10. I will tested it in the water later. I connected mine transducer in the trolling motor.  Futures are easy to ses thanks to the great reviews in you tub. Fast cheaping and well packed Will highly recommend it Will buy it again.
5,Awesome unit for ice fishing. Flasher and traditional mode works great. Can’t wait for summer to use on my boat as well.
5,I use it for ice fishing and couldn’t be happier with it. Best $106 I have spent!!
5,I am using this striker 4 for kayak fishing. It works great and was simple to install the transducer through a scupper hole. I did have to make a mount for it to install through the scupper hole but that was simple with a couple youtube videos. Overall I'm very happy I purchased this fish finder.
5,Great little fish finder for smaller boats.  was sitting over a school of perch in the photo.
3,So I haven't actually used this on the water yet but I did install it yesterday and that was quite the challenge. There is almost no instructions on how to install/set up this unit. I pretty much guessed my way through installing this on my kayak. Hopefully when I try it on the water this weekend it works okay...
5,I installed this on my Sea Doo that I take fishing when I have to go by myself.  Installed the xdcr in the hull and it works great just don't get water temp because its mounted in the hull.  Great to have on the Sea Doo to read depth and track lots of way points that are very easy to program.
5,Still learning it.
4,Really like this small sonar GPS. Mainly use it for the sonar because I have another Garmin GPS I use for my navigation very affordable easy to install and setup.
5,Product works great. Installed it in my new Tahoe boat in about 45 minutes. Lake tested a few times and does a great job. WORTH THE MONEY!
5,Had product just under 6 months it turns on but no display troubleshoot nothing works try to call their service and it's a two-hour hold and then they hang up is there anyone out there that can help us
5,Grt product. Can see the screen in the bright of day. From 0 to full throtle tracks depth and spots fish with amazing clarity! Easy to. Install. Good price. Ty
5,So simple works great lots of features easy to use. You would be a fool to spend 1000's on other depth finders when this one does the trick if you know how to fish!
5,Truly great unit! It was super easy to install (if mechanically inclined) so far it’s been very good and I find it to be extremely accurate! Well worth the price and then some!
5,Small but great package. Works well and great price. Easy to install. My only problem is the power cable is only 4' long so you'll have to extend it on a full size boat.
5,This is the best "cheap" unit on the market. It's comparable to units twice or three times the price. Very easy to use and install.
5,This seems to be a great fish finder. Accurately ranges depths for my 14' aluminum boat when traveling anything slower than on plane. The GPS function could be improved setting titles for waypoints is tedious. Great color screen with good detail and easy to see in even the brightest conditions. It is also easy on batteries. I bought a 7amp 12V battery to power it and have never gotten the charge to show below 12.9V on the display and it only takes about 20 minutes to charge when I get home. I would suspect that it would go for days if needed.
5,I got this item as a gift for an avid fisherman  and he absolutely loves it ! The price is great to !
5,Bought this for my son's kayak. I couldn't have made a better choice!
5,I have had numerous Fish Finder/GPS devices over the years and Garmin has developed the Striker model to compete with all comers at a better price point. Great visibility in all possible applications. I am using as a Trolling motor mounted sensor on the front end of my pontoon boat.Perfect application at less than half the money of the other fish finder manufactures. Since it is waterproof it is also great for canoes and the small watercraft.
4,I really needed just for knowing depth.  Works perfect and the GPS included is great for saving spots where I catch.Dual band screen is nice addition and shows fish.
3,Well packaged instructions seem to be informative.  Not impressed with the power cord being only 5ft long!  I'll half to extend it with heat shrink adapters.  The transducer they got right (roughly 12 feet in length as I did not measure).  I was hoping it came with a thru hull transducer evidently not. This unit comes with the trolling motor mount that doubles as a transom mount.  I was concerned with the screen being to small. It seems to be a good fit on my dash. The screen is very bright which is a plus.  All in all for the price I would recommend this unit.  I gave it 3 stars as I have not had it in the water.
5,So far so good. I mounted it on my fishing kayak. Easy to mount and remove. The GPS does not have map outlines only waypoint marker. But thats fine by me and I knew that when making the purchase. It is very accurate and easy to read. The flasher mode is a cool and useful feature but obviously not as accurate as the vexilar/marcum ice fishing flashers. It gets fairly wet when I paddle and that hasn't seemed to cause any problems. Overall its a great depth/fish finder for the price. I am very happy and would recommend to anyone.
5,Can’t beat it for just over $100 put this o e on my Jackson (kayak) it’s a great little FF for my 12.5 kayak very easy to use anyone who can read should have no trouble navigating thru this thing  would %100 make this buy again it has features that you won’t find on many if any FF’s in the price range
5,I  have been using this product for a week. It was easy to install and it works exactly as advertised. I have found it very useful In low channel water and the application of its  many uses are easy and intuitive.  If you  download the instruction manual it makes the startup and learning process a snap.  As others  have mentioned be careful when plugging in the power and transponder. Speed and way point navigation work great. No other worries.
5,So far so good! We used it this weekend for the first time on our 12’ boat. Seemed fairly easy to install- heard no griping or swearing from my husband while he was doing it. Seemed pretty accurate and it was great information with speed temperature of water depth and under water sonar. Hope it holds up!! Will update as needed if any issues arise. Just what we were looking for at a reasonable price point.
1,STAINS BADLY on the plastic case.. no reasonable explanation for the stains based on the patterns... I ran it by GARMIN CUSTOMER SERVICE as a warranty claim and they blew me off...My initial thought was it was bug spray wipes or suntan lotions or creams.. so i tried "DOTTING" the back with 17 types of those things that I use or have around.. nada... no reaction..still works fine..AWESOME equipment... very hi tech.. yet intuitive operation.... great display even in bright sunlight... actual current draw is 200ma (.2Amp) so it will run off pretty much anything from 10 to 20volts (not written in specs anywhere you have to contact cust support to get info).. and they quote .8amp drain... no way I measured... registering the warranty is a chore.. it comes up tellin ya that the product comes w/o a transducer.. well not true.. and the transducer even has a model and serial of its own...cust support is clueless to help.. and yes. I did not get it registered properly yet.. or the other one that I bought for my son...I am currently running it off a old laptop computer battery recharging with a small solar panel ( I dont have any other power in my 12 foot fishing boat)///  Great value.. feature rich...$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$attached is some pix of the install I did for my son.. a 12v Milwaukee power tool battery ... get the dremel tool out..
4,Love the accuracy and easy to read and use. Put me on a school of reds my first time out.  Easy to identify the fish passing by. Great for the price fits my kayak perfect. Can read screen with or without sunglasses on sunny days.
4,Nice unit for the price. Easy to install and operate. The wiring for battery is cheap and not long enough. The wiring is to small. Otherwise I would give this unit a 5 star.
5,Love how easy this was to get set up and to start using it on the water. Being able to watch my lure on the screen while jigging was impressive. The included picture shows my lure on screen. The accuracy appears great. Overall I’m more than impressed with this I couldn’t be happier with my choice to go with this one.
5,used this on a trip to canada and was super happy with it.  To not only have a fish finder to give you the correct depths but to incorporate the GPS was great.  It was super useful on unfamiliar water because if you pay attention the 1st time you can follow your path to get home safely.  Also we used it to mark fish that we caught and was able to use the split screen to pin point those spots and see depths.  Pretty cool for this price point.
5,Very good GREAT for the price I use it on my kayak and I'm impressed. Its been wet dropped and baked in the sun and it functions like new every time.
5,Haven’t gone on the water with it but did play with it out of the box a bit. Very easy to use and excited to really try it out.
4,works as should
4,So far I really like it for my Kayak.  Just wish the screen size was either four or four and a half inches rather than three and a half inches.  What you get for your money I think is a solid piece of fish finder/gps equipment.  I will see how it lasts in the adverse environment of all weather fishing.
4,Nice
5,Easy to use and great price for a Garmin depth finder. Very impressed with this finder!
4,It works well the way. Stuff just sucks and I don’t exactly understand the frequencies quite yet it shows no fish sometimes when there’s fish but that’s Fishing
4,A fine depthfinder. Easy install and flawless operation
4,My husband will be using this in JAMAICAI cannot comment on the product until it has been u
5,I do like this finder. It worked very well on it's maiden launch on my kayak. I paired it with the 141 transducer mounting arm track mount. I used a Outdoor Products Watertight Box to mount the 12V 7AH Sealed Lead Acid (SLA) Battery for Piranha MAX 160 Fish Finder inside with watertight switch. It was very clear display with good contrast. I like it's size and not in the way while paddling or fishing. The you can raise it up when landing/launching.
5,This is a great unit for a great price. I just finished my first full season with the Striker 4 and it did not disappoint. The readings are accurate and the screen is colorful bright & easy to read - even in direct sunlight. So far it's held up good to the sun saltwater & sand and I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking for a lower priced depth finder.
5,used in lakes in oregon and works grat now if there was just a way to get the fish to hook themselves
5,Bought this for my husband on Father’s Day. We used it for the first time on the river and it was perfect. We weren’t very familiar with the river and this helped us navigate and avoid the low water spots. I also bought the protective cover to go with it and it looks great!
5,Great depth finder has to be best for the money. I upgraded from a humming bird. Packed with cool features like the compass rose. I got one for my Hobbe Kayak and made a mount with pvc fitting into the sail mast. The transducer I mounted inside haul with Marine Goop works excellent. I got small 3lb  12v battery of amazon will keep charged fir days. My depth finder quit turning on so I orderd another one. Returning old one. Another great Garmin product .
5,Love this fish finder! Tried it out on my kayak and it is pretty accurate.  I watched a few videos on how to use/read it before I went out which helped a lot. Price was good and shipped pretty fast.  Wish it used an internal rechargeable battery but I guess none of them do.  I power it with a 12v 7ah battery that I store in the hull.  The wires that come with the Garmin are plenty long enough.
5,Perfect for my fly in fishing Canada trip. Wouldn't have done near as well without it. Easy to navigate and bright display. I used a chunk of plywood to mount base to the Velcro to mount to boat bench. Same with battery. Used peice of plastic conduit and c clamp to mount transducer to boat. Would have bought a suction cup for transducer if I would have planned better and had more time. Nice that it can mount to electric trolling motor too.
5,Easy to install. If you’re using it on a bigger cruiser you’ll need to order an extension cable for the transducer. I was about 8’ short to reach the helm on my 33’ Maxum
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Excelente compra! Fácil de usar.
5,For my kayak was the best solution for a fish finder
5,Does exactly what I need it to do on the river.
5,Best bang for your buck.  I recently replaced my 15 yr old Garmin fish/ bottom finder with this unit.  Not much to say except "I love it".  For the price and functionality I don't think there is any other unit from Garmin or another manufacture that comes close to matching this Garmin.  I use it for my 17' Jon boat.  Works good and hopefully lasts a long time just like the one I replaced.
4,It took me a while to learn how to use this as it only showed water temperature and depth out of the box. I had to figure out how to turn on the fish locating feature which I thought would be the default setting.
1,Not working I traveled for a month and once I get back I tried to open it but it won't work
4,Works well and is very intuitive. The GPS tells me speed over ground and has helped me get back to areas I could not have found my way back to.Be aware there are no maps so you just see a white screen with a dotted trail of where you have been.
5,Great Product simple to use and effective.
5,I had bought one last winter for my kayak and really enjoyed using it this year so this one was for my wives. We were able to get them out a couple of weeks ago and she loved it
5,Easy to use. Very accurate. Good looking sDisplay.
3,Very basic GPS. It's good for marking spots/ramps/trails but sometimes the coordinates will randomly shift and show your island in the middle of the water. I would spend the money on a better GPS with land/structure already on it.
5,This finder is has a clear bright color screen even in bright sunlight. Was easy to install. Simple to figure put without using the instructions.
5,Not enough information on how to set up product and it's accuracy is way off when we tried it on the lake yesterday.
5,This unit works perfectly and does everything I need it to do. I mounted it in my pontoon boat dash and it looks great too. AAA product
5,Easy to use and great imagery
5,Easy to understand menus and learn how to use. Did a good job for my small fishing boat on inland waters
5,I use this depth finder to fish for crappi and to mark places I have found crappi this is a great little depth finder I put it on a 16 ft Jon boat and it's is very accurate and has a great picture easy to use and mark spots and helps you get back to those exact spots
5,Only had it out one time for about 2 hrs....weather was bad.  I like it so far seems to do a lot more than my older Humminbird.  It at least showed fish arches. As far as accuracy not sure. So far I like it.
4,The power wire broke from the fuse in the first hour.  Why is it so brittle?  No map on the GPS function when it was working.  WTF Garmin?
5,What a great  little unit GPS is Amazon sports fish and depths spot on last over 3 days on the battery  I use. I put this on my personal pontoon boat and now I don't think I can fish with out it
5,Super easy install on my kayak. I mounted transducer in the hull and it reads perfect.  Wry bright readable screen.
5,Great unit that can go from boat to boat with additional transducer.
5,This GPS fish finder is amazing.  I use it on my jon boat in both fresh and salt water and absolutely have an advantage on the fish.  Finding the drop off points in the flats gives me an edge.  The depth finder is accurate and I love the GPS.  I cant believe the price.  I highly recommend this unit.  Best bang for your buck hands down.
4,The price is great even less than just a depth finder.  It provided accurate depth and water temperature at low speed but did have an echo line and lost depth reading over 20mph
5,This Garmin Striker 4 is exactly what I was looking for. Built a  mount out of PVC and it is used on my 9' pontoon boat plus it can easily be moved to my canoe.  It works great for staying along a certain depth and when you hook up you save the waypoint and soon will figure out where the fish are hanging out! My dad was impressed enough after our first trip out that he now has one for his pontoon.
4,Great product very nice loaded with features only thing is I wish it had maps already on it depth is very accurate and the depth sounded is awesome for the kind of fishing I do would have gave it 5 stars had maps came pre loaded and the sonar cord would have been about 3-5 longer but it works well for my 16 foot boat!
5,This unit isn't as bulky as the other's i've seen and works & fits perfectly on my Kayak! Happy with my purchase.
1,Would not buy again I used this on Carolina Skiff 2 months and corrosion was too much for unit 4 prong push in connection poor design
5,i have no idea if this works.  i don't know how to read this thing but at this price how could i not learn.just wish i could learn.the speed/gps thingy is nice.but it hasn't put me on a single fish.why not make the fish look like a fish instead of different colors.  sometimes i turn it off and just go w/ me gut.
5,Been using this on my canoe for a year now. It's probably the best one in the $100 price bracket. Mind you it doesn't have a feature to map or store contour maps. You'll have to spend more $ for that.I would definitely recommend this unit. I would buy another one if i had a use for two.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This is all you need to find fish. It’s very affordable and easy to use.
4,I seem to be having some problems with it that Garmin never heard of. Also they said the "chirp" transducer was not full "Chirp" and you have to upgrade the transducer. If I had known that I would not have bought it. Now it's installed it's too much trouble to change. Wish I had known.
5,Great product for the price....5 stars..
5,I have two of these . one on each of my kayaks
4,Very good unit dies not lag when going 35mph. Would be nice with a backlight but I may not have the settings right. You can set a way point to go back to the same spots you pick.  Has GPS speed which is one of the reasons I picked it. Excellent unit easy to navigate through the settings.
5,very nice system for the money and as far as I can tell very accurate for the price you can not go wrong !
5,This unit is by far the best GPS fish finder i have ever owned. I owned half dozen of other units but none compare to this Striker 4. It is accurate it reads the water depth while moving it gives you so many options to view your water depth and your waypoint location. For the 110 dollars it costs it is well worth more than that. I highly recommend this unit.
3,If the transducer stops working it is very expensive to replace. Force few more dollars you can replace the whole thing.
5,For the price try to beat this. Took an afternoon to install on my bayliner bowrider. For the amount of time i spend fishing this was the one. Simple most intuitive use ive seen bright display great instructions!
5,Works Great easy to use
5,Para mi kayak
5,I just received this Garmin Striker 4 a few days ago. It's a beautifully perfect fishfinder with GPS for a kayak. I installed it on my Lifetime Sportfisher 10' with a Scotty transducer mount and a piece of aluminum angle and riveted to the kayak. I can't wait to get out and use it with my 4 year old and I! We do mostly inshore saltwater fishing.
5,Easy to setup and easy to read great beginner fish finder
1,I purchased a Garmin Striker 4 for my kayak. At the time I was using a Lifetime kayak from Walmart. I decided to shelve it for a winter project. Then I found Vibe Kayaks. I purchased a Sea Ghost 110. ( I love this Kayak!! ) Well it's winter here in the Northwest and at 62 I am done for the winter. Today I started installing the Garmin. I opened the box to get out my new Striker and there was no transducer mount  and no power cord!! I fabricated a great mount for the transducer and called Garmin for the power cord. They were sorry there wasn't one but they won't send me one. Instead of sending me one they gave me the part number and told me they weren't expensive. This is not right!! I am still sitting here in my kitchen in disbelief. they were not to thrilled with garmin eitherMoving forward and still not happy I contacted Amazon they were not to thrilled with garmin either. After about 10 minutes of being on and off hold the Amazon rep told me they would just send me the new unit no problem. I can't thank Amazon enough for coming to the rescue. I received the package from Amazon yesterday and will finish my install today. Amazon gets 5 STARS!!
5,Been using for 2 years now on my fishing kayak. Super durable accurate easy to use and unbeatable price point I dont write many reviews but this product deserves 5 stars. Helpwd me locate and land walleye steelhead lunker bass crappie and even musky. Used also for ice fishing.
4,I've only had it a short time but have used it on about 5 fishing trips and it works great
5,After one year working I am able to say that is a very good product.
5,I bought this sonar for my new kayak and it's a perfect fit. It gives me what I need to see to find fish and structure. Anything else is nice but not a need. If you are going to mount on a yak also pick up the Lowrance scupper mount kit. The combination makes this a 15 minute install.
5,for a small boat it helps fing structure and fish. I use it for structure though. I was very happy with the monitor small but if you know what your looking at it works fine. I mounted ming on a peice of plywood and it sits right on the seat in front of me and sees the botton in a small  lake near the house.
4,Lightweight and small size with good features for the price. I use in a kayak for fishing. Garmin does not specify battery needed - had to call them. Read instructions to get the most from this unit.
4,The was the unit straps to the boat... a zip tie to. Hold the unit to the the back of the boat.  It won't last A week  this is the worst way I've ever seen to do this!!!!
5,Can't believe this is only $100. The latest CHIRP technology paired with a GPS chartplotter for marking waypoints is a winning combination. It's small enough to mount almost anywhere and includes everything you need to mount the transducer on the transom or on the trolling motor. Garmin quality is tough to beat and this little gem is no different.
5,I bought this for my husband's birthday.  He realky enjoys it . It seems to be very accurate.  We have used it about 2 times so far it has been a great help locating the areas that the fish are mostly in.
3,This product is a bit of a toss up. If all your wanting is something to tell you depth temperature etc then this is a good unit for you.. It has alot of cool features and is built great but for a little more money you could get a downscan/sideimaging unit that can really do some damage.. All and all if your just wanting a simple unit this is great if your wanting something complex that can greatly improve fishing or diving go with a more expense unit..
5,Since I don’t own a boat I’m using this as a portable fish/depth finder on rental boats at local lakes.  It worked perfectly easy to set up and took less than 10 minutes to figure out 80% of the setting adjustments.The price was right. I’d recommend this to friends and would buy again if I had too.
5,My son and I got this for our jon boat. We are very happy with this model. The clarity of the screen is excellent! We used marine grade silicone to mount the transducer on the hull so we didn’t have to drill as the boat is under warranty.  We found so many fish with this and the GPS worked great! Highly recommend for smaller boats!
3,Not bad for the price but after purchasing and using I wish I would of got the next version up for the DS. The GPS function is awesome though be advised there is no maps just waypoints and tracks. but that's all I need it for anyway. I'm pleased but again wish I spent the extra buck for the DS. I tried using the flasher function out on the ice today with little luck in 10 fow with an 1/8 oz jig I could barely see it or the fish and I tried every possible gain and zoom adjustment possible.
5,Easy to hook up and install. Works well but has a lot of options I haven't figured out yet. I'm not a fisherman but wanted this for my depth and water temp. Will also sho speed and GPS but no map. You can just mark areas and navigate to them.  The color screen is crisp even in direct sunlight and the size is perfect above my gauges.
5,Easy to use
5,Installed on pontoon boat works great.  Easy to remove and store when not in use
5,Works great at a great price... came in on time too... thanx
5,Works very well for a low budget fish finder. I mainly use it for water depth but it's useful for finding under water objects. Durable with a deflective design.
5,This is all you need. You do not need to spend more money. Build quality seems solid. I won't use most of the features this thing has. Finding depth and the best places to fish the Garmin Stryker4 is perfect.
4,Can't really tell what are fish but only got it for the water temp and gps
5,Very easy to use
3,Works well. Easy to install. 3 stars for Garmin's customer service. I bought it and it shipped without the transducer in the box. There was a piece of paper in there that said don't return it call us. I did and the jerk on the other end of the phone basically called me a liar and a thief. I talked to another person there and he talked to me like i was an idiot. I gave up on Garmin and went to Amazon. They just replaced it. and it went well. Next time I'll just stay away from Garmin.
5,Easy to use and dependable
4,Easy to use  put on my fishing boat
4,Good for money
5,Awesome and well priced. Easy to use and works great on my kayak!
5,Installation was very easy. Took it out on lake today---worked as stated in every way. I haven't had a new fish finder in 15 years so to me it was light years ahead of my old one. I priced these at the sporting goods store and all I can say is they didn't have any under 180..00. So this is a great price.
5,The only fishfinder you’ll ever NEED. Works amazon color scheme is perfect! If you’re on the fence with this get it.  I rarely put reviews on amazon but after 2 days of fishing with this I tell all of my friends this is what they need.
5,Works great!
4,Very nice product the screen fogs easy with the plastic cover on it but clears up somewhat fast all in all good product for the money very accurate puts my old hummingbird to shame
2,BEWARE !!  Purchased this unit based on the reviews for a 17 ft lake boat.  The GPS unit DOES NOT show you any detail and no lake contours or even shoreline is included.  I was assuming that the unit at least would show you the lake outlines and I could use it to follow my track back to the boat dock on an unfamiliar lake but the GPS is not detailed enough to even show the lake.  it is mainly a blank screen with the boat on it at about 1-5 mile zoom.  It does show your track if you are in the area you were boating but not in relation to any landmarks or shoreline.  I spoke to Garmin about it and they tell you to purchase a unit with echomap if you want any detail.  Unfortunately the transducer on my unit malfunctioned the first time I used it so the unit was basically useless.
5,Seems to work just fine
5,This fish finder works well and for the money spent I feel like I won. The biggest thing I use it for is depth. This finder is really easy to figure out and does more stuff then I need. For the casual fishermen this is for you. If you are an avid fishermen you might want to get something more complex but this works for me.
5,bought this as all the reviews said this was great buy for the price  and have to say they are correct. to get a fish finder with built in GPS for 100$ you cant go wrong. Only thing being 60 years old wish the screen was much larger but hey  i'll use my glasses
5,If you need a decent GPS and depth finder all-in-one this is a really nice package.
5,As a new boat owner I'm now in the renovation stage of boat ownership. The fish finder which came with the boat didn't work so the Garmin was what I decided to purchase and so far it's been a pretty simple installation. Everything is working and I didn't mess anything up yet.
5,The Striker 4 is a must have for any boat. The GPS is great and the chirp sonar is amazing. Got mine for just under $99. Tough outer case and secure plug in wiring connections. Display is very sharp.  Bought 2 for my bass boat and going to buy one more for my Jon boat.
2,Had the thing eight months- accuracy is good and it's easy to use but it just doesn't last.  Connecting hardware is simply too dainty and delicate.  Yes saltwater is hard on everything but gee who'd a thunk a fish finder on a kayak might get wet?  AND!! I rinsed it with fresh water EVERY time I used the thing.  Currently it's on a SECOND power cable and now the connecting pin to the unit has broken off.  In short it needs a new back but not going to fool with the thing and doubt Garmin sells such parts anyway... I'll get a Hummingbird or Lowrance and save myself the aggravation.
5,Used it a few times. Good options. Water temperature depth speedometer... works well
4,Every thing works pretty good except I can only get it to read 350ft of water saltwater and at very slow speeds. Will not read if I'm going over 5kts.
5,Nice
5,Tech support sucks! Tried talking to tech support and they wanted to charge me for their knowledge. Easy to use recommended YouTube to learning how to use it. Instructions were not that great. Company focused more on other languages instead of what country it’s sold in.
5,Garmin makes one of the best small fish finder/GPS combination units that I could find for my small Sun Dolphin Sportsman Bass Boat. It has a lot of options and is very easy to set up for use. I mounted mine on a Scotty Base and it makes it very easy to take on and off the boat. Strongly recommend the Garmin Striker 4 for any small boat.
4,First one did not work would not power up pretty sure it was the power supply cord but they replaced it as soon as I returned it. Second one worked good.
4,Haven't installed it yet but received excellent service when calling the Garmin folks for some lost nuts and bolts. Very helpful and will soon receive the parts free of charge. That is to me an indication of product and company quality.
5,This unit is awesome for ice fishing. Had a little trouble learning how to operate but once I got it it was great. Would recommend it for anybody ice fishing. My neighbor also has one for ice fishing and he has another for his bowl and loves it.
5,Really like this. Easy to use works well and won't break the bank
5,Great little setup for not a lot of money.  Made a custom mount on kayak for about 5 bucks.  Works great and is better than the old fish finder i have on my big boat.  Excited to use it for ice fishing as well.  I run it on an extra milwaukee m12 battery i have and lasts for quite a while.
5,For the money you can't go wrong with this fish finder.
3,It's mounted seems well I didn't receive a protective cover I've gone through the little box nothing I was wondering why such a product would be sold without a cover I own a Lowrance and Hummingbird they both came with protective covers too early for an honest star rating!
5,I use this kayak fishing and it’s my first one so don’t have any comparables but I love it. Can’t go wrong for the price
4,The written manual which is only available on line is so cryptic that it requires you to call tech support which took over an hour.  The product works fairly well but the depth readings in shallow water are incorrect.
5,It was a present for my husband and he loves it! Now he takes it with him whenever he’s on our boat.
5,Installed the Garmin after watching some YouTube videos on reviews and installation.  Very happy so far.
5,Been using this a month now. It’s a great value. Does everything i need.
4,I have used this a few times now and it seems to be working great.  It was pretty easy to install.  I love the color screen and the options that it gives you.  I would recommend this product.
5,Works great for boating  Super value for a portable unit.  Underwater detail is exceptional for price.
4,Great small unit
5,Can't beat this for the price. I use it in a kayak and I cant believe I ever fished without one. I was drop shot fishing a small Berkley trout worm and you could see the thing bouncing up and down on the screen. Quit fishing blind and get yourself where the fish are. Transducer comes with a couple ways to mount since I rock a kayak I had to think of another way. Great bargain for the cost.
5,I was looking for a unit to deepth find and GPS. For crabbing you can mark your waypoint for your crab pot drop and come right back to it no more guessing. It tell you speed and volt of battery! I really like the unit it you follow install directions it works no matter what speed I am traveling at! I would recommend this unit!
3,Great fisher finder seems to work well when it stays on. I wanted to love it but it kept shutting off.
3,So far depths work good. Did get a replacement turning off and on by it self and screen goes dark. So far the second is working well
3,The Garmin and transducer units are fine. However these idiots shipped a 20 inch cable tie that doesn't even work so the transducer will not sit properly or securely on my trolling motor.
1,One little splash of water ruined the screen. I contacted garmin I am now going through an rma process. Very disappointing as this happened durring an important trip with my son.
5,Works great.  We wakeboard on a river that has stumps and random shallow spots so we use it for the breadcrumb feature. And mark any hazards we come across.
5,Still learn how use but great I love it
5,If your looking at other fish finders just stop. This little gadget is great.  I use it for ice fishing and it works outstanding. If you like the flasher type this has it too. It also works just like the $500 ones. Excellent buy!
5,Unit is very easy to use. GPS is very handy to mark structure and where you have caught fish. I have been using it for ice fishing but plan to also use it on my kayak. Flasher mode works well but does get some interference at times. For the price it outperformed my expectations.
5,I just love my Striker 4.  I am able to monitor my battery voltage which appears at the upper left of my screen.  Being a GPS it also shows my boat speed over land (bottom) not through the water.  It would be perfect if the GPS had a map of the U.S. but for the price of most bargain fish finders you cannot beat this fishfinder and GPS combo.
5,bought this and fitted it to my kayak for bass fishing in California. Works great and i've been able to mark fish and then catch them. Great entry level unit and perfect for the kayak.
5,Nice piece of equipment. Cant wait for the Ice Fishing trip. Will add more to the review when that is done. So far this thing is awesome!
4,My boyfriend was thrilled to receive this gift for Christmas. It seems to check all the boxes for his fishing needs. We will have to wait until fishing weather to see if it works as well as we hope.
4,Good product
5,I bought this as a gift for my fiancé. He loves it!
5,Returned just to upgrade
5,I've not really learned or used all of the features yet.  Bought this mostly for a basic depth finder on my kayak.  Was easy to install and does the job.  You won't find a better fish finder in this $100 range.
5,Arrived promptly in good condition with all parts. Took it on a fishing trip on a lake where depth varies from 6 to 30 feet. The display was bright and the amount  of detail was impressive. The GPS did not acquire a couple times during the week upon start up. I restarted the unit and it did come on. Look forward to exploring more of its features on my next trip.
5,Si
5,Received Garmin and used it today and very happy it!
4,Good cheap fish detector/depth finder/GPS
5,Seemed to work fine it was a little tough figuring it out but worked fineI did not use tech support
4,Small compact easy to use and you get your money’s worth
5,Highly recommend this one. Very simple and easy to use. I would buy another one of anything ever happened to mine.
5,I bought this for my husband for his birthday to put on his new boat and by far it’s his favorite electronic'! It shows the depth your speed and most importantly the fish! When you buy it don’t forget to buy the rechargeable battery!Its great also! Happy fishing!
5,Works Great!
5,I am a transporter for an auto dealership in Florida the Garmin Striker has never left me down
5,This is a great ice fishing fish finder have used it twice and it works great!!!! The down side to mine is that it reads the depth about 6-8 wrong. but that is not the worst thing in the world.
4,A little difficult to figure out the buttons.  Manual could be better too.  Clear and bright and easy to read.
5,Works great then it stop .reported the problem they replace ASAP. great service
4,Great value for the money.  I've had some issues with the speedometer feature on the unit not registering on occasion which requires me to reset the unit to factory settings quite often.  However it shows lake bottom detail very well.
3,For a hundred and sixteen dollars its great but if you have a  small boat or a kayak you need a 12 volt battery. I returned it for the portable unit with a 12 volt battery works great mobile I can use it in my kayak and inflatable.
5,Easy to read water doesn't seem to bother it easy to connect and get going right out of the box
5,Great little unit to use in the lake
4,i liked it i already installed it on my RIB  but still cant get the gps to work
5,Use it on our little bass boat. Easy to read and colorful. Marks fish and underwater structure. We have a larger Garmin for our bigger boat and we love it too. Garmin customer support is very helpful.
5,Great product works great replaced one that was stolen
5,I've only used this one time but was impressed with it. I still haven't used all the features it has but will as I learn more about it.
4,I've used it only once and it seems to work fine.  I haven't used all of the features yet.  I need to read the manual and play with a while.
4,Nice compact size and easy install surprised at how easy to read.  Bought this as replacement for my Hummingbird and so far very happy.
4,Nice
5,It has a lot of options but I am still learning how to tell what the different things on it are. And I like the ability to use it ice fishing also. I bought a new boat I can't wait to do all the mods to it. I would recommend it to my friends.
5,Worked great and a really good price.
4,Easy to assemble . Accurate readings .
5,Best bang for the buck on a fish finder. A lot of features works great.
5,Installed on a 14 ft aluminum boat. Works really well for a lower priced unit. Comparable to my high end unit on my big boat. Like others have said the power wires are pretty fragile I put on alligator clips and not problems yet.
5,very easy to setup
3,Easy to install but like all fish finders...IT LIES there are not any fish down there. LOL
5,Nice little fish finder. Easy to use connects to trolling motor as small as 30fp or on transom. Seems to work very well i have no complaints. Personally i dont rely on fish finders to show me where the fish are but depth seems accurate gives a good idea of structure water temp and speed..which is nice in a kayak w no speedometer.
5,I purchased to use as a portable unit for a  kayak and remote Canada trips.  To test it I tried it on Lake Erie beside another fish finder. It really worked great locating baitfish and walleye. Would definitely recommend.
5,I now own a Garmin fitness watch a Garmin GPS for my car and this Garmin Fish Finder. Garmin products work and they are not difficult for an old geezer like me to understand how to operate. AND they have EXCELLENT service people !!
4,It shows me depths I can save waypoints and it shows me routes and I have already traveled for the money I paid for it I am very satisfied
5,Bought this as a gift for my dad. I mounted it to his kayak. Easy installation. The image is clear and is very accurate. For the price it’s a great buy.
5,Have used it now for two weeks I love it it helps out immensely still trying to figure out some of the things but YouTube helps out a lot
3,Nice for the money. I mainly use it. To describe the bottom. I wish the mounting bracket was better made. But other than that not bad for the money.
5,Seems to work well in our freshwater lake great for the money
5,I have not used all of the features. I have mainly used it for depth finding  water temp and sometimes to locate fish. Not good at locating fish yet
5,Purchased more for the depth vs fish finder.  DIY install...no leaks.  Installed on 19' bay boat with limited console space.  Great fit and works great.
5,Great for ice fishing and boat fishing.  Used it last year ice fishing in very clear water about 4-6 ft deep and could corroborate the depth of where the fish were biting my line.  Best bang I got for my buck.
5,This is my first fish finder. I wish there was a specific tutorial on how to read this unit but I've been applying the info from others on how to read properly with some success. Great value for the money. The image is really quality. Probably the best "intro" unit I've ever bought.
5,Great quality product
5,Awesome fish finder for the price.
5,Product works great and is a very fair price. I just our purchased my first fishing boat and it is perfect for it. There is no lake maps that I know of on it so that kind of is a bummer but other than that it gets the job done!
5,Great for the price. Wish screen was bigger. Need glasses to see some of the stuff. GPS tracker is super great.
5,Easy to use and install
5,Took me time to figure it out since I have never used one before. Excellent for the low price. It was cheaper on Amazon than in the stores!
4,Met all my expectations.
5,Great product . Muy boat came with one  so returned and got a the refund !!
5,Works excellent way more than I expected to get
5,Bought on a budget. I placed it on my 16 foot center console boat and it worked great. Can’t beat it for the price and functions. Easy to install.
5,First GPS fish finder I have owned.  For the money I could not ask for more.  I see fish and lake depth. Speed and water temp and color. Battery voltage is nice too.  Very happy.
5,Perfect low cost fish finder . Very clear screen easy to setup and use. I use this for ice fishing and my boat.  The way points are a great time saving feature.
3,I love the flasher function for ice fishing. I hate the moisture buildup inside the screen from the temperature changes from ice fishing.
5,para gps siempre garmin
5,Excellent depth finder for a kayak. I plug n remove off my yak every time with the easy connections and mount. I did have to modify the transducer some other wise it worked great! Very pleased!
5,So far so good . Installation was a breeze and it is so easy to operate. I plugged it in and turned it on. Didn't even read the book on how to use it. Very easy to navigate the menu. Great fish finder for the money and love the gps type tracking feature.
4,Nice unit for the money.
4,seal around the transducer was shredded.  Garmin sent me a new one and had the same issue.  Come to find out from the Garmin engineers it doesnt hurt performance at all.
4,accurate
5,This is my first fish finder ever so I can’t compair it to anything else. Bought it for my kayak to take on the bay/rivers. Works great for what I need it for. No complaints.
5,Awesome little unit. Best bang for your buck under 100 bucks!! I made a portable  box for it so I can take it from canoe to boat to ice fishing. Very happy with my purchase
5,Exceptional product for the money!Caught 50 crappie that I would have never found if I had not purchased unit!!!!
5,Installed on our boat and very happy with the design and function of this unit. I was just looking for a depth finder...but this is packed with many useful features speed tracking time...now I don't have to worry about a few inoperable gauges ;-)  East to use / Recommended! (Shown here I mounted it into a cup-holder not much room on my Bayliner 175...looks great 'eh?)
5,Good for the price - No issues.
5,Used for ice fishing. Works very well when using the ice transducer (sold separate)
5,Seems like a well made fish finder
5,Easy to install and easy to use. I wired it to my 12v fuse panel on my boat and it’s been working well.
5,All good working fine and delivery fast. Please note that this model doesn't have a chart mapper.
5,I simply use this unit on my dash because it comes with all the items I needed for locating myself and my fishing spot. For the price it is a real bargin.
1,Easy to install but not easy to navigate through different screens…. The one I had would black out every time you changed screens
4,Worth to buy perfect machine for Kayak and small boat.
5,Buen producto
5,great gift
5,nice fish finder should work great.
5,My husband love it!
1,This GPS is a glorified fish finder.It does not have a navigational map. It is way out dated. Even cell phones  today have marine GPS apps that display a map. So this must have antique software.This is like an old fashioned hand held GPS that shows the steps on a white blank back ground. Could be an island  between you and your destination and this will not route you around it. Worthless as a GPS but works good if you just want a fish finder depth finder but that's it. Get a app for your phone instead or buy a real GPS.
3,The transducer lead was not long enough to reach from console to transom on my 18 ft. G3  If your boat is 18 ft. or longer it may not reach!  Otherwise seems like nice unit but have not been able to use it as transducer will not reach water  Seriously Garmin should warn users that the transducer lead is not very long.
4,For the price it's super great!  I just wish it showed the boat's speed.
5,Easy install great little unit! It can see the fish tell you your depth to bottom water temperature and voltage left on the battery supplying power. I would recommend to anyone on a budget for a fish finder. This is one damn fine unit for small water craft.
5,You will not be disappoint. Is a great addition to your vessel.
5,so far so good
3,Had to buy marine seal should of came with some imo
5,Easy to set up! Works great!
5,Works great
5,Excelent product
5,Good price for quality product. Had an issue with hardware and customer service resolved it.
5,The Gamin Striker 4 is an excellent fishfinder at this price point. The display is bright and offers a nice picture. The Striker 4 exceeded my expectations. I would recommend the Striker 4 to anyone looking to purches a fishfinder for a small boat.
5,No better fish finder at this price range on the market. Perfect for small boats and kayaks.
4,Great little unit.where would I find another mount and transducer with power cord so I can put it on the troll ing motor
5,This is awesome. I bought this mainly as a depth finder but it's so much more. Fish show clearly on the screen as does detail such as weeds. Water temperature and speed are also shown. For the money I doubt you will find a better unit.
5,Works great!  I installed it on my kayak and had it on the water this weekend. I like the gps functionality although the screen may not be big enough to use both that and the sonar at the same time.  It was a breeze to set up and install.  I run it off of a 12v power tool battery.
5,We are very happy with this Garmin. It tracks and shows depth which is all we really needed. It doesn't have a Fish Finder if you are lookin for that. But for the price and easy install it is worth the money.
5,Love it. Works great
5,Perfect fit
5,It was a present for my sister for Mother's day she loves it even though she's not entirely sure how to read it lol
4,Seems to work ok.  The gps speed tracker takes a while to sink up but ok.
5,It's a good fish finder  great  features
4,Only used it once so far but it seems to be working well. Can't to continue to use it. For the price works great!
5,Been using this for a few weeks and loving it.  Marks fish well and plots GPS points to easily get back to the same spots.  Ordering another for a second boat too!
5,It’s a name brand you know and has more features that a similar model sold in stores at a “better” price. Quality product.
4,It works really good on my kayak. For the price you can't beat it.
2,It is easy to install and use is not too bad could be better. other than that a no go. it only lasted 5 trips on the water.It never got wet on the boat and always removed and stored in the house when not using it. on trip # 6 nothing. Would not even turn on.  I checked all connections all were solid. broke out the voltmeter I had good voltage at the plug. tried to turn it on again  NOTHING !!!  At this point I broke out the 10 lb sledge and resolved the issue
5,Good product easy to use. Is the basic one of course but works perfect.
3,Moisture get between the outer glass and the actual screen when boat is in storage. Strictly the humidity in the air as it's kept in a water tight box on the boat when not in use. The accuracy isn't super but for it's price point it does what we wanted it just marks fish frequently when there are really not fish there or even loose weeds unexplained.
5,This fish finder was the perfect size for my canoe.  Mounted it on the gunwales.  Now I just have to figure out how to read it...
5,Very nice product for the price! already went out a few times in the ocean mounted n my 20' wellcraft! went as deep as few hundred feet and the color screen is awesome! Controls were very easy to use.
5,Boyfriend bought this. Loves it and is easy to use.
1,This isn't 'portable' at all.  I bought it for my kayak and stupid me didn't read all the reviews.  First it needs a 12v battery...or you can buy a nocqua battery pack for an extra $90+ with additional cables ($20).  The mount doesn't have suction and can't be mounted to a kayak without purchasing additional mounting brackets ($35+).  The screen isn't waterproof and doesn't appear to be well suited for taking out into saltwater where it may get splashed.  It may be perfect for some pond fishing but that's about it.  All in you'll spend over $240+ for this to get it powered and mounted.  Needless to say I returned mine.
5,Easy to Use
5,Nice fish finder with a bonus of GPS.  Though not a chart-plotter it is nice to be able to store a waypoint on an inexpensive fish finder.  I found the brighter night view mode works better in full sun than the normal view.
5,This fishfinder is by far the best I’ve ever had in the 100 dollar price range. Super easy to use . You won’t need more if you using it on a kayak
5,I like the size it’s portable and easy to use
4,Fast delivery Product came complete with mounting screws and all as described. very happy with purchase.
5,Works great
5,Compact easy to use fits great on my kayak good screen
5,just barely hooked up waiting to test out on water apparently my garage floor is 9ft below the bottom of the boat lol wish the cable was a little longer barely reached
5,Very simple to use perfect size for my yak.
4,Tracking my route and marking areas of interest. Can truly see fish on on the fish finder.
5,Product works great. Does what it's designed to do super easy to use and wire up.
5,I have had all the major brands except Garmin. After trying this unit for 3 months and comparing with 2 other finders at the same time this unit completely out performed the more expensive units! By far the best finder I have used for the money
4,I installed it but have not yet tried it. Seems a good fish finder
5,Works Great
4,Very satisfied after I had talked with Garmin CS (they were great!) and found out that the GPS takes quite a while to find the satellites.
4,Size easy install  need to learn more about it
4,Probably all I need when I get to use it
5,Awesome product installs easily.
5,Cheap and easy to use graph with GPS.
5,I am very pleased with this fish finder for use in my Jon boat especially for the price. The only negative thing that I can say is the screen size
5,compact and works great!  I mounted transducer through the hull and is working as good as I could ever imagine.  Great to have GPS on this as well as dual beams.  Compact and easy to read.
4,Works well and was not real expensive. Been very happy with it.
5,Ive only used it on two hour long outings to mess around with the settings. But I love it so far. I'll be using it ice fishing this winter too so I will update my review then.
5,I love it . Many features  easy to use . Got me on fish .
5,Got it as a gift for my brother and he loves it
5,Easy to setup. Bright screen and seems to be accurate only time will tell. Have only used twice because lake are closed
5,I really like the size  it’s so easy to take out and put in.
4,Very detailed.  Sometimes it looses my speed and restart brings it back.  Way better then goggles.
2,OK so far.  Easy to use.  The question is - how long will it last?  It is replacing a garmin that only lasted 4 years.  Update.  It became erratic after a week of using it.  It could not be turned off unless you pulled the electric power plug to kill it.  Then it began locking on a 1 foot depth indication and would not change to give the actual depth which could be 30 feet.  Again would not turn off and reboot.  Tried many times. Sent it back after a week.
4,Would give 5 stars but didn't come with instructions.  Great ice fish rig for the price comes with gps and a flasher
4,Buena deteccion muy bueno
5,Best value out there great on my John boat gos is nice for night fishing
4,Works as it should easy installation easy to use great price. I fish fresh water 45 to 180 ft.
5,I've never needed tech support but I'm sure they're helpful. This is a real good fish finder for the price and if you're like me its everything you need.
5,Installs easily. Instructions detailed. Works great. We love we can program a route and store it.
5,Best fishfinder under 200 hands down.
5,I bought this for my kayak and based on everyone's reviews on Amazon and YouTube. Super easy install and it's very easy to use. Definitely worth the money
1,Horrible product but more importantly the worst customer service I have ever experienced.  Item was not working I was told by Garmin to return it for a replacement unit.  Replacement unit was REFURBISHED !  I called and demanded a new unit and was told rudely what I sent them was used ! He refused to send a new one.  Obviously it didn't work when used !  So I emailed and was told I was supposed to get a new replacement since mine was only a couple of weeks since purchase.  That one does not work either so now I have to change the transducer and see if that works. I wrote to the owner of the company no return contact.  I will never buy Garmin again what a horrible company.
5,This fish finder I use on my old town predator kayak easy to install and does exactly what it says. I give it an A++++
2,I was replacing a higher quality Lawrence with this. No comparison except it has gps built in. It looks like an old fashion video game. Low pixel count and small screen. It was very voltage sensitive as well. I had it in a kayak and the battery was just under 12 volts and you could barely see the dim screen. The buttons feel cheap and for me it was hate at first use. If you are a first timer like many of the other reviewers you may be impressed. I was not.  Spend a few more bucks and get a better one.
5,Great so far. Very easy to set up.
5,I purchased this for my husband for his kayak. Great packaging and quick delivery. He loves it and is very excited to get back in those tight spots where the big fish hide.
5,Funciona de maravilla...con una batería de moto de 12 V trabajo perfecto por más de 10 horas. El brillo de la pantalla es espectacular
1,It did not even work one single day for full without turning off. Yes I checked voltage and it did not fall below the recommended level and I used a 35ah battery. Whenever I use this it was turning off intermittently. Apparently some dbag designed the power cord and fuse. The fuse is not encased in a waterproof housing and that itself creates all kind of corrosion problems to the power wire. Also all the wires are of poor quality. They got one thing right and that is the first three letters of its real name GAR--BAGE!!!! bye bye to this POS company.
2,This is a solid fish finder for the price. I have been satisfied with the product the handful of times I have used it however it is no longer working. It stopped working during one boat ride and while looking for the problem I realized one of the female ports on the power cable was slightly bent. While I get 12 volts at the power cable the unit will not turn on. The replacement cables are fairly expensive and I am concerned this may be a recurring problem. These cables are fragile so be very cautious when plugging them into your fish finder.
4,Arrive on time united was more than expectied
5,I like everything about it. Easy to navigate threw the different settings. Nice quality and nice price.
3,Works well but at times it shows the wrong depth. My boat is 20ft total but the transducer cable isn't long enough to reach my consol....have to buy an extension cable. Will wait and upgrade to a better unit.
5,Works very well a lot to learn yet as there is a lot of stuff it can do.
5,First one I had quit on me after 4 uses even tho it worked great during those uses so indec8ded to get a new one and this new one works like a charm. I love it a very great thing to have in a kayak!
4,Works better than I expected for the cost.
5,Gift for spouse. He loves it. Great picture quality. And finds fish.
5,Only played with it on the water once but it seems to work pretty well..  accurate depth and speed readings and shows the contour of the bottom and any other blips in the area
5,Finding fish depth of water
5,This thing is a beast i have it on a 16 ft lund and it is the perfect little campaniion for the occasional fisherman like me even easy to set up and use
1,The most basic thing this needs to do is connect to the transducer. Everything else is irrelevant. Does not connect. Useless.
5,I have only used it once. For the price I was amazed The color screen really lights up. For such a small unit it is very easy to read.
5,New kayak user. Purchased this to make it more fun and still learning to use it. But from what I have used it for so far it has been great
3,No es amigable. No trae Mapa de Tierra. Confuso y pierde precisión a velocidad media
4,Works good so far
5,Prices great only need it for depth and water temperature
4,It works great just complicated to figure it out. I recommend  this to anyone who wants a garmin boatside and can figure out stuff easy.
4,Great unit for the right price although I had to send the first one back the exchange was done smoothly.
5,This is a great little unit going to buy a second one for the front of the boat it comes with trolling motor bracket.
4,you will like this unit!
5,Works great on our 21foot pontoon boat..
1,Nothing worked in this order and I am disappointed in the Amazon web site the Amazon representative and  the whole system of the Garmin and the Chrome Battery. After talking to the Garmin Representative I had to go out and buy a new fuse for the Garmin and a new multimeter to test the battery with Garmin system. Nothing worked together like advertised and I even bought wire clips to connect to the battery. The second Amazon representative Kelly R took care of sending everything back and making sure I did not lose money spent through Amazon. She was the only bright spot in this whole fiasco. I have learned to use  local stores for electrical items. Have no idea if the fish finder would have worked had it worked.
4,I still don't know how to use it very well but I haven't put enough time to learn it.
5,Good for the money
3,This was gift and i have not heard from the person that  i bought it for if its works or not.  But like they say no news is good news..
5,My husband was surprise with it's clarity and how user friendly it is. This is the first one that he will take it off the boat when not in use. Price was reasonable too.
5,works as it should great color no issues...
5,I think this is a great fish finder for the price.  Lots of features and works great.  Just what I needed.
5,This fish finder is amazing for the price. Gives me everything I need: GPS water temperature depth and 2 different frequencies for finding the fish. Sad to say the fish magnet doesn't seem to work...
3,I bought this to replace a 301c.  I need the GPS for foggy days.  The mapless Striker 4 GPS did me no good so replaced it with a Garmin Echomap 43DV.   Garmin 010-01563-01 echoMAP CHIRP 43dv with transducer        .  Ordered the portable kit and will use this with my kayak.
4,Works great! Just wish there was a map.
5,locating fishing areas and depth readings fishing in kayak
2,You can't read the screen in the sunlight. You really need a cloth to cover the screen and your head to read it during the day.
5,Thanks
3,I got what I paid for just I should have gotten the next bigger screen depth finder works great even while running 35mph! Also I like that I can mark hot spots holes ledges drop offs ECT.
4,Works good
5,Don't waste you money on one of those high dollar gadgets this fish finder depth finder and GPS is the ticket.  Other than it is a little small it works awesome!!
5,Yet to use but it's a Garmin all other products by these people have been great.
5,Works great on my old town predator 13 fishing kayak! Can’t go wrong with this unit.
1,made it just past the return date then the light went out can't see but shadows on screen
5,Works better than expected. In spite of having to drill through the back of the boat it was fairly easy to set up. The shallow depth alarm is perfect for protecting the prop!
5,Best low end fish finder for pontoon boats.
5,This thing is awesome. Great addition for my jon boat.
5,Worked great 1st time out. Couple glitches over a couple hours but then it kept working just fine. Gps works great. Love this product.
4,On my Kayak and working as good as the boat
5,It gives you the essentials plus. Depth water temp marks fish time of day speed your traveling waypoints and way more. Easy to install. Would recommend!
4,It’s good. does the job
5,Perfect kayak finder. Lightweight and easy to use. No frills easy controls and easy viewing in direct sunlight.
5,The Garmin is fantastically reliable and easy to use.  I've used other brands that malfunction or freeze up within months of use but the Garmin has been reliably functioning with no freeze or malfunction.  I would buy another without hesitation.
3,I couldn't the hype everyone raves about on this fish finder... it wasn't no better than my old one on locating fish
4,Love it but had some trouble understanding the instruction on GPS.  Good Price and really shows up good in bright light.
5,Fishing
5,Well worth the money! Easy to install easy to operate with many of the same features as more expensive units. Way to go garmin!
5,Have set it up yet
3,Eh. This thing is hard to figure out! The instructions are not the greatest so you have to do research elsewhere. We use ours mostly for navigational purposes and to find ledges where fish "might" be hiding.
5,Very happy with this product less expensive then the stores around me and came with everything I needed to fish off my kayak and off the pier
5,Put this on my pontoon boat to save the prop and the GPS is right on
4,Was a Christmas gift - he loves it
5,Works great much better then the one I had before.
5,Perfecto
3,I love the depth find and trail marker on the product.  The mount is a piece of junk.  The depth finder falls off frequently for no reason.
5,I like its ease of use Would recomend
5,Nice little sounder for the money. Nothing fancy but works just asit is supposed to.
5,Easy to use very accurate easy to install.  I didn't rate the tech support because it is just not needed
5,Good brand but it doesn’t support Arabic language. But over all I do recommend it for fishing lovers ^_^
5,Caught a 32" the first day. Great product for price. Going out again to use it.
5,Only thing is I wish it came with more cable straps and screws and a second cover for the wires
5,Great product. Love the beep that lets you know you are close to something.
3,lets you know what isn't biting your bait fairly well.  Obnoxiously hard to use the GPS functions and doesn't come with maps but I like it for both my boat and ice fishing.  Knowing the depth alone is tremendously helpful.
4,Works as advertised. Took a few minutes to figure out that  I was in demonstration mode.
5,Replaced really old fish finder.  Not top of the line but great value for price.  Easy to install love the flasher feature.
5,overkill for what I needed but glad I purchased it. Love it
4,I like it it is new to meNot sure what are fish
4,Got this for my husband   and he is very pleased
5,I used ice fishing never had an issue. This summer it is getting mounted in my kayak if the lakes up here ever melt...
5,The product looks and work phenomenally. I just need to learn how to read the damn thing hahaha.
5,Great little depth finder.  Perfect for occasional boaters who don't want to spend a lot of money on a depth finder.
5,Husband is thrilled with his new fish finder. This one has more functions which is great it doesn't confuse brush for fish.
5,This is a must have for any boat.  Accurate worth the money
5,Nice unit for the cost.
4,Tricky to work. Watch some videos to get a better understanding
4,This good low bettery and easy play good good garmin
5,Don't waste your money on the on high priced units that it takes a doctor's degree to understand....This is a very good unit ....Very good for the pontoon boat..........gps fish finder depth....easy to read........plus  plus...on the Tennessee river...Rjr
5,The size and functionality make this item a must have
4,Screen is pretty small but for the price it works great.
4,Great little plotter
5,This Garmin is  better than my Lowrance Hook 5 that I spent hundreds of dollars on.  Graphics are crisp and it’s very accurate.
5,Great purchase and a great price would buy again
5,Easy install. Easy to navigate. Can’t beat the price for this type of quality.
5,Works the way it was promised.  I love it !
5,Has to be one of the best fish finders I have ever used. Excellent quality! Excellent screen as well.
5,didnt realize how small the screen is but other than that it's a pretty good fish finder. I only use it for depth and navigation any way since everywhere i fish seems to be extremely shallow.
5,I have an expensive depth finder for the front of my boat and mounted this on the helm. Really impressed with the quality of the display and the technology for such a low price. A great buy!
5,I set waypoints to spots and get to them later. perfect for saving and remembering spots. I can't get lost with this GPS.
5,This was bought for my little pond hopper boat and ice fishing and so far I love the flasher for ice fishing. I can't believe all of the features for a little over $100!
5,Lowrance shamance. Who needs them when you have garmin. In my opinion this model way out performs the lowrance model at the same price point.
5,It’s a good unit but I wish I had went with the 4 plus for the contour mapping.
5,Fantastic unit - the waypoint mapping feature helped us immensely as we navigated Lac Seul this summer.  For about $100 this unit was an unbelievable bargain.
5,Great gps for what I do easy to use
4,Would be 5 stars but doesn't come with owners manual
4,looks good and works fine
5,I loved it is spectacular totally recommended.
2,I plugged the 12v and the Transponder lead into Device. Got error saying Transponder not Connected😂
4,Not bad for the price seems to work
5,Very nice unit. Used it a few times and no complaints yet. So i dont see any in The future either. Would recommend no problem
5,Great device. Very accurate. It was very easy to install and very easy to use. I would recommend this to any one wanting a smaller unit.
5,It is great.  I was able to find fish and structure.  Depth and temperature reading were accurate.
5,The same height and features as the big boys with an $87 price tag. Excellent choice.
5,Awesome product accurately reads depth even at 23 mph
5,Does a great job and I am very happy with this.
4,Very good product
5,Keeps accurate track of exactly where I go. Got it to get me home when the fog rolls in.
4,works great easy install even without directions!
5,Awesome little unit. Mounted on my kayak and it's very helpful!
5,Perfect for my small jon boat.  Very detailed.  The GPS history and waypoint markers really come in handy when trolling.
5,I found this fish finder to be an excellent starter unit for amateu fishermen and more experienced anglers alike
5,Nice little fish finder for the $. I have had for a year or so and works well.
5,Works well! Easy to set up easy to use. Very pleased.
5,Works great for my kayaks . Very easy install .
5,Good for the pricing. Used for river and bay and i use primarly for depth.. works great
5,Great fish finder although the GPS is limited to marking points (no mapping).  That was dissappointing however was in the description of the product I just didn't understand the meaning.
4,Easy to use.jm
4,Easy to use. Easy setup.  Basic fish finder and does it with easy controls.
5,best darn gadget I ever done did put on that thar boat.
5,VERY responsive easy to use and great display. Lots of bang for your buck!
5,Installed this on my classic 1979 Sea Ray.  What a great value.  Easy install and works great.  No complaints.
5,Easy to navigate through options instructions weren't great but there are a couple YouTube videos that can help.
5,Small but has a lot of functions
5,Have not yet used this in action. I like the compact size and all the features in a small unit.Can fit it most anywhere.
5,I bought this to replace my small Hummingbird. This is a fantasic product at a great price. The one drawback is a really flimsy mount.
5,very clear it even has the time
3,Its good for the price
5,Did everything it said it would do. Only have taken it out once so time will only tell if it lives up to expectations in the long run.
4,good product would recommend.
4,I have only had this a short time but for the rereational user it works great
5,For the price it seems to work very well.
5,Exelente producto 100% recomendado
5,Depth finder worked great along wirh the speed of my kayak.
5,Works great and the price was awesome. Easy install.l I used a youtube instructional video but I could have done it without.
5,Had it hooked up and working in minutes. It doesn't have built in maps but rather a blank white page that tracks your GPS location so you can mark areas and return. Great options for the screen layout as well.
4,It well do the job. Wish the screen was larger.
5,Best investment I have made for my boat so far. Simple to use and easy to understand
5,Installed in my Pelican kayak using a shoot through the hull placement.  Works extremely well the first time out.  Good reading screen is easy to read installation is super easy.  No complaints.
5,great system for the dollar very happy with it and would recommend it to others who don't want to spend a small fortune on a fish finder
5,Love it! I have it mounted in the front of my Jon boat and the transducer on the trolling motor. Easy to install and very easy to use. I would definitely buy again.
4,Great fish finder w/ GPS for the price. No video tutorial anywhere though.
5,Love it easy to use mount and store. It’s the easiest gps / fish finder I ever used.
4,Wish screen was larger
5,Esta buenosimo. Mu util la alarma de bajo fondo. Funciona correcto
4,very easy to use
5,Great little fish finder. For the price can’t be beat. Easy to use and install.
5,Very easy to use works awesome
5,Great value and performance  mounted the transducer on the electric trolling motor. A great addition to my 13ft aluminium boat.
5,Works well for what I need it to do. The price is right for the quality of the product. I'm happy with mine.
5,Just had installed and worked very well!
5,It has some good features
1,This is a review of the company and not the product.  This was suppose to be a "NEW" unit and it appears to be repackaged.  The main unit does not have a screen protector on it and after calling Garmin directly they said it should have a screen protector for shipping if the unit is new.  There is finger prints all over the screen like someone opened it and decided to return it. Although the unit does not appear to be used only repackaged it should not be sold as NEW!  there was also a small bag in the box that was empty which would also indicate the unit had be opened and repackaged.
5,It came quickly was easy to install and easy to set up.  It worked great out on the ocean.
1,This produce only worked one time  and since I only used it once in that month it was too late for a refund. !
5,Everything....paid more before not as good
5,Works great! Easy to install. Wish the transducer wire was a little longer but I spliced and extended it. GPS function is very accurate.
5,Easy to install. Great menu options  works perfectly in all modes. Gps plotting option is great. For the money it can't be beat.
1,Didn't work at all
5,Great gadget for the price. My husband  loves it so do I. Just isn't a fishfinder it's a GPS and other features. E as y to use and very well made.
4,Great little unit
5,Excellent product for the $$.  It does everything it should.  Easy and intuitive.  Installed on a tritoon with no problems.  Thanks for such an outstanding product!
5,👍
5,Great product
4,works well
2,purchased on November of 2019. used it twice and it stopped working. checked the wiring fuse and so on. took the back of and found the soldier connection for the power wire had disconnected on the inside.
5,This works great. My husband is very pleased with this. Finds fish and depth.
5,Purchased this as a gift for my husband. It was exactly what he wanted and it works wonderfully.
4,good
4,Good product for the price.
1,First of when i first got the item it takes a while to turn it on everything is installed correctly with my battery but after a few uses the screen just shuts off and has no power whatsoever my battery is charged and its new. I was really dissapointed i like how small it is and perfect fit for my kayak but now i cant even use it anymore. I dont know if this a product defect but i was hoping i could get a replacement.
5,Best GPS fishfinder on the market for the price. Can't wait for summer to use it...
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Not so happy. The mount is crap if you press a button the whole thing swings down and you have to adjust the position all over again. Not sure what the problem is but it's annoying.
5,Verry practical. It needs a case. The power cable could have been longer
5,For the cost it works great. Have been using it ice fishing so far and love it.
5,For this for the hubby for Christmas he loved it and thinks it's the coolest thing ever
5,I pretty much knew I would love this based on my research ahead of time.  Has done great so far.
5,Small unit with excellent graphics.  Big improvement over my old Eagle.  Installation was easy after fishing wires under the deck.
5,Nice addition to our pontoon. Installed easily and has been working fine. It also gave us a speedometer which we never had before!
5,Great product used for ice fishing took some trial and errorbut worked good
5,I purchased this for my trolling motor and to use while ice fishing. It works great.
5,For the price this is pefect. Wish the screen or at least writing was bigger but works great for me.
5,Great product. My dad loves it.
4,works fine no problems
5,All mounted except I need to wait till water drops to install transducer
5,A great FishFinder at a great price....Much better than the Lowrance it replaced....Only used it 3 timesbut I love it....Thanks Garmin........
5,So far it has def met my expectations.
5,Fantastic unit used it for ice fishing could actually see fish follow lure great price
1,Do not buy this depth finder. They are faulty. I’ve gone through 2 units now. The first one I purchased through Academy and it failed within 5 minutes on the water.  The second one I bought through amazon and it failed after the third full day of use.  Now I’m going through farming warranty to get it replaced.  The third one will probably fail as well.  Yes I’ve checked the fuse with an ohm meter and I’m getting 12v to the power cable.  Unit is dead. Won’t turn on. Buyer beware
5,Works great. Now if only I could find a fishing buddy who actually knows how to fish!
5,it works grate& its easy to install
4,Gift will know after he gets it
5,This product works very well. I would recommend it to anyone.
5,Like the ease with which it hooks up.  Wish the screen was a bit bigger but I knew that when I bought it. Nice unit for price.
5,Awesome sale
5,It didn't come with a manual.had to download it
5,love it. Use it on my pontoon
5,Love almost everything. Wish the power cord was about a foot longer.
5,Love this thing on my Feelfree lure 13.5
3,Work great as depth finder. Does not come with detailed instructions which it needs. Gps will require more time and effort. On line instructions not clear
5,What can I say it's a Garmin. My third one. All three work awesome. Easy to use.
5,Works great user friendly with lots of features for a finder of this cost. I really like it and wouldn't hesitate to buy another.
5,The best
4,I like it.  the equipment is very simple to install
5,I love this fishfinder. Very easy to install. Fits perfect on my Nayive Ultimate 12. Love the clarity of the color screen.
5,I love this thing works great and I still have yet to learn everything it does
5,Easy to install and easy to use
5,Easy to install worth every dollar
5,Great fish finder IMO!  I’d be willing to pay more for it!
5,Very good for the price works great
5,Good value for the money
5,Great product no prob so far

4,Good fish finder did what I wanted it to do
5,Works great! Has helped us catch many fish and avoid lots of underwater hazards.
5,Great product for the price.
5,Limited use but it appears to be working very well graphing both fish and the bottom.
1,It doesn’t even fit the garmin transducer. Abosolutely pissed!!!!!
5,Clear easy to read.
5,Very nice
5,easy to used and effective  to find fish
5,I like it.
3,Cheap price and great product...I recommend it to all fishermen..
5,Worked great the price was good to
5,I kept it portable to use for Fishing boat kayak shore fishing. Photos to follow!
3,So complex I am unable to operate most of the features. It will do a lot of things if you can figure out how!
5,Took all of my new supplies fishing and had a great time!  Very pleased with everything!
5,It came way before it's estimated arrival date.  Hooked it up  tested it out in open ocean works just great.
5,Love it! Just need to print out booklet for more directions on how to plot way points. Wish there was user manual included with this product.
1,Bought this a year ago and only used it a few times screen started clouding up when you first turn it on and then would clear up .Thought maybe the sun was doing this was mounted on my party barge with a hardtop.after trying to use it a few times this year now the screen is all blacked out. Wasted my money on this and now have to buy another one but will no buy this one again.
2,If you are looking for a permanent mount transducer this unit is not for you. The transducer is made to strap onto the bottom of and electric motor. Fortunately I saved my old Garmin transom bracket and was able to make it work. Sorta. I wish they would be clear on the type of transducer this thing has. Very little in the way of operating instructions.
5,Works great
5,Great product has everything I need can't wait to use it in the spring.
5,I love this product
5,Bueno
4,works well . worth the price
5,easy  to use
5,Definitely exceeded my expectations... would buy again
3,No detailed manual even online version screen really small  So many options but no manual to explain options in detail
3,Good fishfinder for the money.
5,Mounted it on my inflatable pontoon and it’s awesome
2,seen so very many good reviews I guess the one I got was a fluke because it kept blowing the fuse. I tried to stop it even changed the fuse fitting without success. So I have no thought on recommending other than the excellent Prime return policy. Maybe give it a chance and see my problem maybe just one of those things
4,Great product for the price !!
5,It is what I needed.
5,does the job !
5,Nice gift
5,Nice fish finder just wish it was a little bigger
5,Easy to install and easy to use.

5,Excellent for the price. Look at reviews this is a top choice in this price range
5,shipped quick product as described. Nice addition to the pontoon
5,Great product poor assembley instructions. Would suggest using the five or six Youtube vids on assembley on boat. Mine was for a pontoon.

5,It's very good
5,exactly what I wanted and at a very reasonable price.  Works very well.
1,Stopped working after a few months.  At first it accomplished what I wanted-decent depth finder.  Now it is just obviously wrong in depth read out.  Buying a replacement NOT a new Garmin
3,Not accurate and moisture builds up on the screen.
5,Great starter fish finder
5,Excellent product very happy.
5,Great guide
5,Very nice sonar and works well in my kayak.
5,Bought as a gift to my hubby and he loves using it. It was simple to set up and use.

5,Great

5,Great device!
1,They sell this as a fish finder with GPS.  There is no GPS.  There are no maps and there are no navigational aids.  When I contacted customer service the rep was extremely rude.
5,Killer for the price
1,I ordered this item and it was dead out of the box... I sent it back and ordered a second one and it is dead out of the box... so I sent it back.  Time to try a different brand fish finder.  AVOID...  it's JUNK!!!

5,Works great easy to use
1,I purchased the Garmin Striker 4 on June 11th to install on my Pontoon boat in NCWhen we got here on July 11th in did install it and it worked fine it has since failed and when I called Garmin the recording said there would be at least a 30 min wait and I should called back later.It would appear I am now passed my return window. I AM NOT a happy customer at this point how can you help me resolve this issue? John561-346-9862
5,Love it I'm gonna buy another one for my other boat some.
5,Awesome GPS  Great Deal

5,Easy to install and very user friendly menu and features.
5,Exceptional quality and product.
5,User friendly
5,BEst fish finder for the money it’s worth it
5,Boat
3,NO Maps
1,As best as I can determine this devise doesn’t detect fish.  I have tested it with live fish on the line twice and a weighted bobber…it did't see a thing.  When it does indicate fish below I have many times lowered my lure directly down to the depth indicated and NEVER caught a single fish.  Go figure.  It does detect depth that agrees with my OEM built in depth finder.  Great…I already had a depth finder.
3,Have a larger boat and it cannot support accurate reading on medium to faster speeds
5,Good
5,Very nice unit.  Works well.
5,Easy to view
5,Brought it for my dad. He loves it!
1,I use this product to fish Puget Sound where depths frequently exceed 400FOW. Unfortunately this device fails whenever I paddle into water deeper than ~400'; the failure pattern is typified by the unit showing no depth and the screen displaying only static. The failure continues when I paddle into more shallow water. This product consistently renders me blind and is a great disappointment.
5,Great garmin
5,Works great nicely made unit.
5,Really small screen bring your glasses
5,BEST BANG FOR BUCK FISHFINDER AVAILABLE

1,After pressing the on button Garmin is displayed then screen goes black. Its not the backlight control all other control buttons are dead.

5,A very nice portable fish/depth finder.  I really like it.
5,Great Item!
1,This was really nice the first 2 times i went out second time it was raining third time started shorting out turning on and off fourth time nothing at all. for some thing that built for the water you would think it could handle a little rain but.........not in my case so unless you fish a place that has next to no water spend the extra couple bucks and get something that will last.
5,Excellent
5,Nice little gps fish finder does a good job easy to install
5,works great

5,Awesome product from Garmin.
5,Small  unitlarge features
1,Purchased a Garmin Stricker 4 through Amazon unit failed to power up Garmin is nice enough to send me a refurbished unit to replace the new defective item I paid for. Seven to ten days I will try the refurbished made in Taiwan unit. Would not recommend this unit unless you have a lot of spare time required to find out unit was defective.
5,Nice👍🏻👍🏻
5,Excellent
5,Works great and love the GPS!
5,Works great.
5,Fish can't hide!!!!
2,Not accurate on fish and hard to program water depth!
5,Thanks
1,We bought this believing in the Garmin name brand and features provided. After install once our boat was placed in the water this worked for about 10 seconds after turning on and shut off. We have tried everything to get it to turn back on. Checking all wires power etc. And NOTHING. Although this was a great price unfortunately it does not work.
5,fast delivery and good performance
5,awesome product
5,LOVE IT WORKS GREAT IT WAS WHAT I  EXPECTED
5,Best on the market for price
2,Sorry to disagree but in my opinion its hard to read. Cant tell if you are seeing fish or other deperee in the water. Depth finderbworks great.
5,A+ Great
5,Works like a charm and easy to use.
5,I did not purchase it.
3,Great for the price.
5,Mounted it and working very well.
3,Can't locate exact location of fish.
1,Hard to read and too sensitive for things like kayak paddles and the same thing goes for anything bigger than 1oz
5,Works great!!Have had hummingbird before this is so much  better!!
5,Very good
5,awesome cheap product would definitely recommend it
5,Works superbly and updates frequently.

5,Great!
5,I bought 2. I m pleased. Very good seller.Thanks.
5,great
1,Not working properly .... Hung up after 35 minute on hold for Tech Support the first time.  Second time on hold 45 minutes before Tech Help.  Tried working with this unit 3wks but giving up will probably be returning item.  Really disappointed with Support & unit expected too much will be going back to another Hummingbird.
5,great item. Thank you.
5,excelent product
5,awesome
2,Without a chart plotter this unit lacks in usefulness in saltwater it also stops reading depths at half engine speed and fish reader leaves lots to be desired. Only useful for canoes or Kayaks
5,Excellent for the money
5,Very nice
5,good
1,Garmin does not ship a charger for the unit.  Returned.
2,i bought this product and it worked maybe a month
5,cannot beat the price for the features just sayin
5,Great unit even better price
5,Finally got to use it and it worked great.
5,No complaints.
5,Great close shave.
1,the transducer that came with it doesn't have a gasket i think water is getting into it and making it short out. I also can't get a hold of anybody from customer support.
5,Gift for son and seems to be fine.
5,ok
5,Works great GPS is spot-on
5,Excellent for a kayak
5,Muy buena experiencia
5,Good tool to have. Great for a beginner.
5,super
5,Love it
5,Great
2,I've had it on the water twice the second time it would go through periods where it would turn off randomly. If it does it again over the long holiday I will be returning
5,Works great like a Garmin product should. Highly recommend!
5,It's a great product my brother loves it
1,Unfortunately we ordered this in the winter months and did not open it until the window of return had closed.  It could have just just this particular GPS unit but it just did not work no power.  So perhaps this isn't a review of the product just our unfortunate experience.
5,works as it should
5,All ok
5,good item
5,NICE
5,Fast service love it
5,works fine...good value.
5,OK
5,Great little unit.
5,Good~!!
1,Bought this early as a Christmas present for my husband.  By the time it was warm enough for fishing the return time was up.  We had it installed by a boat guy.  This thing never even turned on.  Very disappointed.
5,So far so good
5,Love it I would recommend it
5,A lot of tech in a small package.  All I wanted was depthGPS speed battery voltage water temperature GPS heading and depth alarm.  There is so much more I can’t honestly give you everything cause I’m still learning more ever time I take the boat out.  Lots of UTube videos out there to support you and educate you as to all this unit is capable of.  Worth every penny.  Suggest you buy a cover too.
5,Outstanding product
5,Works well
5,A fantastic fish finder
5,Excellent
5,Works perfectly!
5,very easy to operate and understand
5,good product
5,just what I was looking for
5,very nice unit
1,It doesn't work accurate below 14'degrees. I bought it for ice fishing so it is not much use to me. After trying it a few times unsusessfuly I read in papers with it that iwouldn't work good  below 14 degrees so it isn't what i need that should have been stated in the add.
5,Good GPS for price
5,Love it
5,Just what I wanted
5,For my purposes it works great.
3,Good
5,Very good purchase
1,When I researched this Garmin striker 4 the question and answer section said it included a transducer. I took the unopened box to the marina to have it installed. They said there was no transducer included. I felt that this was very misleading. I purchased this product because transducer was supposed to be included.
5,Son-in-law loved this! Great product!
5,Excellent product
1,Bought it for my uncle. Per his it’s hard to use and set up. Once it’s set up it works OK.
5,VERY HAPPY ! Thank You
5,GREAT
1,The Garmin has no maps waypoints to setup before leaving the house . It stopped working this year only used it twice. Hopefully I can return it and get another type with charts and everything
5,Great unite
1,if you need one for 5 months then throw away then this is for you! If not then please buy something else. Im stuck with a pos.
1,I fully expected this unit to show the lake with limited details.  Instead I'm navigating on a white screen with no details. The product description lacks alot of information.  The word "deception" comes to mind.
5,Great for Kayaks. I love it.
5,great tool great price quick shipping
2,Unable to get readings on my kayak
1,Very unimpressed have bought other Garmin products and was very happy them but I am not impressed with this on. It was very inaccurate and only lasted a few months before it stopped working entirely would not recommend for the price there are many better options out there
5,Excellent
5,works well
5,Good for the price
1,bought in November hooked it  turned it  on came on so I thought ok put it in the closet over winter finally got warm enough to take boat out and thing wont even come on
5,Love it. Priced right.
5,works great
1,It only works for kayaks canoes. Metal fishing boats.. but you couldnt tell that from the description or that it's some of these are only for salt water or fresh water.. 🤷🏻‍♀️.
5,Met expectations.
5,Very impressive for the cost.
5,Very good
1,Transducer wire came split. doesn't have plug for back of gps
1,Mine didn’t come with a manual and is reading 40 ft of water when I’m in 4ft.. messed my prop..smh garbage if u ask me had it out twice lol
5,Works great
5,great buy works good
5,Works great
1,Installed it and used once and then screen started blinking and fading.  I plan on sending it back to Amazon and getting a better one.
1,It went out on the second use dident work right on the first then the store refused to help me or let me return it said i had ro contact the manufacturer
5,Great product
5,Great item
5,Works good
5,Great value!
1,No directions for installation 3 page condensed manual frim 27 page one you have to download on a computer.my 1st use it didn't work only cameOn but no info on screen. Called Garmin for advice .was told to try again.then return it if no data on the screenn
1,Big problems with power cord. On it's own line from the battery so it's not the operator.  Returned it for another one and the same thing.
5,Great value.
1,If I could leave less than one star I would. Unit survived one day out on the lake; one week later head out again and unit won't power on at all. Save your money and buy something else.
1,I couldn't figure it out. My son said it was complicated to install. All I really wanted was a way to go from point A to B with it telling me if I was on the right path or not. The rest of it was too complicated.
1,It is sold WITHOUT batteries or possibility to put some  not for a kayak ...It’s NOT portable
2,does not include the transducerreturned for refundthough being from Taiwan would be safe to buy
1,Just call me stupid we couldn’t figure out to use this still not hooked up.  Can’t find anyone that has a clue how to hook it up
1,This was returned for an exchange for a model better suited for a kayak. It was a gift so I do not know how well it works.
2,Took it out twice and stopped working
1,Good fish finder but if you wanna return it amazon won’t give you your money back.
1,The picture is blurry can hardly see it very disappointing for the cost I wouldn’t recommend this product
3,Data cable needs to be longer to reach the back of the boat where it must be mounted. Data cable is too short
2,Requires Drilling into my jet skis
1,Unit did not work right out of the box what a disappointment.
1,This fish finder has great features and easy controls but started malfunctioning after a singe year of use. Days after malfunctioning it died completely.
1,worked 3months. dead now and no mention of any warranty on any of the documents.
1,Installed pretty easy worked for 2 trips now gwts tower but will not even power up deff would not purchase.
2,Fair performance.
1,This GPS is POS. Shuts off randomly during normal operations. Defective product that is not being accurately reviewed on Amazon.Be wary. Not recommended for any watercraft.
1,Worked fine for first month going to have to replace it already
1,It doesn't have the black and orange split view
1,I received wrong item  not a  fish finder but a laptop accesoriesmoney stolen
5,Review: 5 Stars I will precede this review by saying that I am by no means a professional angler. I enjoy fishing as a hobby and nothing more. I purchased this sonar unit about 6 months ago. Overall I am very impressed with this product.  Although this is not a top of the line unit it is a great product for a beginner angler. With a very affordable price tag the striker 4 is ideal for many fishing applications. It’s compact size also make it very easy to store and travel with. This device has a 3.5 inch LED color screen which I found to be a perfect size for ice fishing.  This unit also does NOT come with a 12v battery. This must be purchased separately.Features1. Technology  a.  Chirp Sonar  i.  The chirp sonar included in this unit provide a crisper image of fish ‘humps’.  This technology will also help to  distinguish one fish from another. This was very helpful when using the traditional screen. I could clearly  target individual fish in a school when vertical jigging.  b. Waypoint Map  i. The waypoint map on this unit is similar to any other device. With this map you can mark any important  place you need to. This feature also allows you to see your position on the map in relations to marked points.  This was very helpful in finding exact locations of brush piles and other structure when returning to a lake.  This feature was a huge time saver for me.  c. LED Screen  i. This unit has a 3.5 inch LED screen which is on the smaller side in relation to the rest of the market but you  can’t beat the price. In my time using this I found that the screen was a perfect size for the applications I was  using it.  The brightness can be adjusted to save battery or to view the screen better at night. I usually set  mine at 50% which I found to be plenty bright for most occasions.2. Transducer  a. The dual beam transducer provides a more accurate depth reading as well as fish location. The maximum depth  for this unit is 1600 ft which is way more than enough. The transducer comes with a mount to attach to a boat.  Although the unit does NOT include a specific transducer for ice fishing the transducer that it comes with is  capable of being used through the ice. (Note: I used the plastic “boat mount” piece to make the transducer sit  parallel in the water column.)3. Ice vs. Open Water  a. I used this fish finder for both ice fishing and open water situations.  This unit has a built in flasher made for ice  fishing however I found that I like to use the traditional screen for most cases. However the flasher is a cool  addition that makes this unit very versatile.Troubleshooting1.  Screen Clutter  a. When I was first getting use to the features of this device it was difficult to get a clear reading on the screen. Every  time I put the transducer in the water I would get a screen full of marks which made it impossible to read let alone  target fish. To fix this I went into the settings and set a custom gain. This number will vary depending on many  variables however it is an easy fix.Recommendation: I rated this unit five stars because I have yet to have a complaint about it. I have used it around 20 times on open water and through ice without buying any accessories. (Except the battery) I would highly recommend this product to any angler that is looking for an affordable unit to increase their skills as a fisherman. To this point I am very happy with Garmin and the Striker 4.
4,I'm not going to go into how the unit works since there are so many reviews like this already. However there are a few things that no reviewers have really covered.- Garmin packages great units with cheap transducers to keep the price low. This is true for almost all of their fish finders. In fact most of their units costs less than a single quality transducer. In the case of this Striker 4 they include a 2 frequency (and only 2 frequency) transducer that they use in CHIRP mode even though it is not a CHIRP transducer. The description says CHIRP transducer but the Garmin website makes it clear that this is not a CHIRP. This means that the clarity and image separation and noise immunity are worse but from what I've seen it still works pretty well.- Garmin offers higher quality transducers with a range of frequencies (so you can choose any frequency rather than just 2) but as mentioned above they cost more than this Striker 4. But the question remains is it better to spend more $ on a higher featured unit with the lower quality bundled transducer or a lower featured unit and spring for the higher quality transducer. I think many experts would vote for the second choice but most people stick with the included transducer. The GT8 I upgraded to has great clarity and noise immunity but I didn't do a side-by-side to see how noticeable the differences are compared with the bundled transducer.- The Plus models are pretty much the same as the standard models except the screen and unit is bigger...however the screen has less pixels per inch so the display is much blockier and lower quality. They also include the map charting function (that builds a map while you boat around) which is honestly a cool feature but there are free phone apps that have lake charting maps built in (with more detail than a charting function) and Garmin makes an amazing paid version. So again....spend the money on the Plus or the Garmin App...take your pick.- There are other models with Downview (sees under the boat at very nice clarity) and Sideview (which separates the left and right of the boat). However for fish finding the Downview/Clearvu offers very little. It's cool to see what's down there or if you are looking for a structure that fish may be hiding near but does not see fish. The Sideview is very difficult to use and get a meaningful picture from but it has the one advantage of identifying which side of the boat fish could be on. Still you don't know how deep or how far towards the bow or stern. When used with the standard 2D it is more useful but how useful is up to the user. Also keep in mind that transducers that do Sideview and Downview and Clearvu are very very long like 6-12" long may not easily fit on some boats cannot be hull mounted etc.- This Striker 4 is a very small unit and may be undersized if your boat has a steering wheel. But using a giant fish finder on a 12' boat is just as odd takes more power costs way more etc. So what size is usable and not going to get in the way is up to the user. If you use this in CHIRP mode (especially if you upgrade the transducer) you can see all you need to see on the one screen. Although this screen is too small IMO to show two types of frequencies/displays at once in CHIRP mode you get the best of multiple frequencies on the one screen and the 3.5" screen is plenty viewable for that.- These fish "finders" really do not find fish per se. You are never even with a large display going to be able to say "there's a huge bass at 3 o'clock and 10' off the starboard side let's go get 'em". Fish move around the boat moves around and the sonar can only take samples of the area. In the end the fish finder is more of a fish "detector" so you know fish are nearby and their approximate size and quantity. If you can see the display do that anything larger or more complicated is unnecessary IMO.- The connectors on these Garmin units are odd. They are a bad combination of not being super secure not being super weather resistant not being compatible with anything else etc. If they had to have a non standard connector I would have liked to see one that was secure enough that if the Striker toppled off the boat you could use it to pull it back in. As it is a "weather cap" or adapter (4-pin 8-pin 12-pin) is often needed for these delicate things.So there you have it. You can spend $30 on a fish finder or $3000. But make no mistake that the lunch is free every model has upsides and downsides and even the cheapest Garmins are really nice and far better that nothing. I ended up getting the Striker 4 and used the $ I could have spent on a more expensive/bigger unit on an upgraded transducer case waterproof bag etc. Whether I made a good compromise only time will tell.
1,Me dicen en el hotel que devolvieron el paquete
1,Was not a new product as specified. Came open and in another language.
1,Only worked twice then would not come back on
1,worked 3 times then stopped working
1,Constantly shows depth is 5 feet deep
1,What a piece of s.....
1,spend money for a Lowrance
1,we never received it instead a blanket of pac man
1,The display backlight died after 3 uses.
1,Needed more than $150 of additional accessories to install on kayak (battery cables transducer arms etc.).  Also if taking this on the ocean you will need to protect your battery somehow.  Was not as simple to install as advertised.  Pain in the a$$.
1,KEPT SHUTTING OFF ORDERED A REPLACEMENT
1,Does not function as expected
1,still cant figure it out
4,Overall I'm very satisfied with this unit. The depth and fishfinder functions work great. They include enough cable on the sonar to get to the back of a 16 ft bass boat and mount the unit on the front. The power cable is shorter and I had to wire it in to the console however.A few things to be aware of:This unit does have GPS but it's only waypoints. It does not have the capability to show maps.The way the unit mounts to the base is not very secure. I won't leave it on going down the road or in rough water.The screen is nice and bright as long as you're looking at it straight on. I found with polarized sunglasses I had to reposition myself sometimes or it looked like a black screen.It does what I needed for hundreds less than the competition. If you want GPS maps the Plus unit is just a few dollars more.
4,Great unit for the price. Got it to use as a backup unit to my larger Garmin on my big boat. It can do almost everything the big unit does. Easy to install . Only negative thing I have to say is I find it harder to read in bright sunlight. Who knows maybe it's me  !!! Amazon once again got it to my front on time as promised. Thanks Amazon.
5,WORKS GREAT. ...OPENS UP AN ENTIRE NEW WORLD OF FISHING FOR ME  only thing you need to make sure of is MAKE SURE THE TRANSDUCER IS IN THE BOX WHEN YOU GET IT  I got mine yesterday and luckily I opened box when I got to my car before I left for fishing trip and THERE WAS NO TRANSDUCER IN BOX luckily I bought mine at store and was able to go back and the next box they opened had a transducer. I'VE READ ABOUT 40 REVIEWS ON THIS ITEM AND THERE WERE SEVERAL PEOPLE THAT DID NOT RECEIVE THEIR TRANSDUCER IN BOX And I Believe it cuz it happened to me yesterday. MUST BE A PACKAGING ISSUE WITH COMPANY BUT ANYWAYS GREAT GREAT PRODUCT.  Used it first time today  on a lake I've never fished before and WITHIN ABOUT 20 MINUTES I HAD LARGE SCHOOLS OF CRAPPIES MARKED AND WHEN WE WENT IN FOR LUNCH WE WERE AT 63 FISH CAUGHT BETWEEN 2 GUYS IN ABOUT 3 HOURS OF SOLID FISHING. I love this thing  I'm able to locate track and fish in lakes I've never been on before. WORKS GREAT ON MY OLD TOWN CANOE.PICTURES - MY DAD AND ARE CATCH by LUNCH.
5,I have had this fishfinder for 3 years and have had no problems 2 days a week and sometimes more fishing 12 volt battery for 20 dollars at bass pro shop and that's it and you're ready to go fishing mine is setting on my center console on my ss127 bonafide and battery inside the console like anything else In the world sometimes you get a bad one or a good one so for me I would buy a another
1,Ok here is my story.I purchased this unit early summer of 2016 and it is now late summer 2017. I used it a couple times in the sun in that time period. Then recently one time in the rain. That put an end to the thing. Next time out squiggly lines appeared on the inside of the screen indicating moisture condensation. The readouts were of course completely corrupted - random symbols or changing inaccurate depth info. In other words Garbage. Ruined a fishing trip.I decided to call Garmin to see how they stand behind their products even tho the warranty had expired. Here I encountered the Hidden Company drama. No phone number on their lit that came with the unit that I could find just a web address for Support. That web support web page also lacked a phone number. It just provided access to the manual and related info.I searched all over the Garmin website and found no way to call them. Now I will stand corrected if I missed something but I sure gave it a go. In any case I Googled “garmin phone” and surprisingly got a number and this indeed got me to a support line.The rep that answered was friendly and tried to help. But she said since the product was out of warranty so the best they could do would be to send me a replacement for $89. Ok understandable I guess but not all that great an offer since these sell for about $100 now .And I imagine there would be shipping charges one or both ways.I asked if this unit has a history of water failure. She said not in her experience. I guess she doesn’t read Amazon reviews where this problem is described multiple times. (I see no attempt by the company to respond to product problems reported here.)I should have given more attention to these reviews myself! Ironically I had chosen this unit over a similar Lowrance product where reviews indicated a consistent failure problem.Now how in heavens name does a global technology corp produce a marine product that is not waterproof that fails in a short exposure to rain?
5,Fitted this to my Viking kayak which has a transducer recess easy to fit. Can't believe how good it is for the price I have it hooked up to a 12v lithium battery I sourced cheap online. 20000mah lasts for 4-5 long days fishing so good for long multi-day trips. Used in saltwater been dunked and splashed no dramas. Bright and easy to see in the sunlight. Really great product.
5,Kayak rear mount worked great. Moved transducer to inside bottom still work great with depth but I believe lost some sensitivity didnt pick up fish as much. Depth and GPS worked great seemed to drain my vexilar battery with 10hr fishing trip. Excellent $$ value. It broke when i left Controlpanel in garage didnt like the winter freeze. Display is bad. Cheap enough to buy another.
5,Got this item for my Kayak. Mounted the Garmin and the battery on a 1 X 6 about 14 inches long; makes for easy install and removal from kayak.  Transducer stuck in Plumbers putty bottom inside of kayak between my legs.  It works great I now know the depth of water I'm in as well as seeing that there are indeed fish there as well (just haven't figured out how to get them to bite). The only problem I have had is after using it and stopping then going again it won't power on immediately.  I have to disconnect the power line input reinsert it to ensure a good connection then I am good to go.
1,Worked fine the first time second time I took my boat out it wouldn’t show the depth transducers probably shorting out
5,While I can't say I am a pro with depth and fish finders I can say this for the price this sure seems to have all the right features! Simple and very readable (and pleasant) display accurate depth finder good fish finder nice GPS for speed tracking and way-pointing multiple modes I don't always use (because as I said I am not a pro with these). Also easy to install and a nice "quick disconnect" mount and wiring system so you can take it off the boat when needed.
3,I didn’t buy it from Amazon it’s usually cheaper on WM.Used mostly for a depth finder on a 25’ sailboat on a notoriously shallow lake although I do fish a lot. I mounted the transducer with denture adhesive inside the boat to shoot through the hull and I can’t get it to be as accurate as the older unit I have also mounted inside hull. Any shallower than 7 feet and it won’t read. But does OK under sail in 7+ depths.
5,Didn't purchase this on Amazon but this outperforms other sonar units 4x its price easily. Downside is there are no navionics maps. Images are clear and precise sonar is very sensitive and the screen is very bright in direct sunlight and very sharp. Transducer is sensitive enough to pick up anything from a small sinker and larger. Comes with transom mount that doubles as a trolling motor mount if you wish to mount it there. Highly recommend this product.
5,Very good product
3,I would give this 5 stars but for the fact it is very hard to read unless you are within three feet.  This might be great if it were on kayak and right in front of you!  I have had Huminbirds and Fish Eagle and can read from anywhere in my 16' boat.  Also each time I turn it on I have to reprogram the GPS before it will work.  The split screen is impossible for you to read if over two feet away.  I gave it three stars because it is accurate and would be great on a kayak or canoe.  If you have a larger boat save your money and get a larger unit.  I also purchased the case after buying this unit.  The connectors are very small and I don't think they will hold up after much reconnecting!  After having the unit a few weeks foggy moisture had developed under the screen.
5,Excellent!!!
5,Installed it on a FatCat float tube and is the best addition i have made to fishing gear in quite awhile. I would recommend this Garmin 4 striker to anyone.
1,Purchased this item 4 years ago used very lightly on fresh water and removed from boat when not in use.  This started working sporadically after 2 years.  I didn't need it often and it would work intermittantly so I thought it was probably a power problem.  (Hard to troubleshoot when it was working).  This year it stopped altogether so I was able to check for current in the boat wiring with a voltmeter.  Everything is correct to the back of the Garmin.  Their website provides very little opportunity to give feedback.  One of the main reasons for purchaseing a Garmin was the brand reputation.  I hoped it would last as well as my new boat.  Since my use is light it pains me to purchase a new device every few years due to poor manufacturing/quality.  I will not purchase another Garmin and will recommend that my friends and neighbors stay clear as well.
5,First fish finder I've owned. Very impressed on how much info you get for the price. Used to fish without a fish finder. Never again. This one works great!!!! Strongly recommend.....
5,Does this unit work for ice fishing in cold temps
5,Nice
5,Just  a great fish finder gps combo for the money. Works great easy to use . I have two of them in boat.
5,Gooooooooood!
1,Complete junk. Worked the first time out on my kayak. Second time it worked for 3 minutes then all the transducer does is reset every 3 seconds so I can't get a contiunous scan. Now I have holes in my kayak where the wires for it went. Trash. Do not buy.
2,They quietly slip it past you and when you realize the thing has no capabilities to use or load maps it's already installed and you can't return it. It just sucks?
2,I bought one of these units at Christmas to replace an old Lowrance unit. I first took it out in March. It worked great as long as were were slowly fishing but it turned off every time we hit a bump while running at speed. This is not cool if you are in unknown waters and want to know how deep the water is. I tried to secure the power supply wire to minimize movement but it still turns off when you hit any kind of wake at speed. Will be returning.
1,I bought this for my husband primarily for ice fishing. I read reviews saying it could be used for ice fishing but it isn't obvious that it doescome with all you would need. Turns out you would need a battery (12 Volt?) to use it ice fishing. We returned it and bought the portable version. However the portable version still needs a mount to work appropriately. I'm sure all these things are obvious to those in the market for a transducer GPS fish finder... but it would be nice if it was better advertised for a rookie like me who just wanted to get her husband a cool toy.
2,Used it once worked fine but the second time I tried to use it it keeps saying unsupported transducer. Maybe I’m missing something but I doubt it I bought it brand new very disappointed!
2,After reading other peoples comments I realized I was correct. My Garmin striker got wet and it quit working. It would not power up. It was a good fish finder the time that it did work. I only had mine shortly over a year. I think I will be trying a different brand of fish finder.
2,the transducer came in  three parts  could not put it together .I gave up after two days . Asked seller for one together otherwise will send back
1,Useless in salt water because it has no chart plotter.  You can wander around blind hoping to stumble across fish or navigate to a mark hoping the fish know their supposed to be there but if you're hoping to use a map to fish structure this is utterly useless.  The "plus" version has the option of mapping and storing images of where you've already been - but unless you plan on covering the entire ocean or only fish in straight lines it doesn't really help.  I'll never use it.
1,You can't transfer waypoints onto this machine and that fact isn't communicated clearly in the adverstisingl/marketing of this product.  I've got an old eTrex and I can transfer data off and onto it so why isn't that technology and functionality incorporated into the Striker $?!  At any rate had I known that I couldn't transfer my (fishing) waypoints onto the Striker 4 I wouldn't have bought. Period.I'm sure if they made this lack of functionality clearly know to prospective customer/buyers those potential customers/buyers would NOT purchase this unit.  I know I wouldn't have.  Very disappointed.
1,Missing battery connector
1,Got off to a good start but the unit started failing after a couple months. Getting through to support has been a nightmare.
5,This is the best GPS Sonar device ever. There are no maps but it dioes an excellent job of showing your course and trip travels. seriously if you don't know the area or have a map to work against you should not be on the water. The sonar fish finder will find minnows and whales with ease. the selective displays are really nice. the night light features are impressivly useful and make SURE YOU BUY A COVER.one issue is that there is no cutout template to surface mount the unit in the map like directions diagram
5,Installed quickly and easily. So far no issues. I don’t understand why the dim button is also the power button; took me a while to figure that out while on the water. I like that it has gps speed depth water temp and time/date on display.
5,This is on my 14' aluminum Jon boat. Works great. Nice bright display even in direct sun which is something I was worried about. Its a small display but I have it mounted in an oarlock and I can read it with my 56 year old eyes just fine. Good layout on the buttons. It has good accuracy and resolution for an entry level sonar. Low battery drain even on the brightest setting. I mounted the transducer on the transom following the directions and screwed the bracket directly to the boat. Worked fine. No issues. I wish the manual was a little better but whatever. I figured out how to do the things I need it to do. I think this is the best value out there. I'm very happy with it.
5,Love garmin's big fan. Perfect for the Jon boat. Accurate and simple to read. Love how it tells me the speed I'm going on the water. Shows water temp. Your able to distinguish between bait fish and other fish. Use it on my boat and kayak. This product has helped me real in the big ones. My youngest son knows how to use it. There faq's on the website are simple easy answers no run around from them backed by a great warranty also. Extremely recommended for any type of angler
5,I fish Idaho mountain lakes in a 12 foot aluminum and our other lakes with a 19' Bass boat..this finder has been put to the test and worked great..It can keep up and be just as accurate as my installed Humminbird. Mountain Lakes hold nice cut throat and this with the float puts me right in their backyard...Now finding them and making them bite are 2 different matters but this found them..Recommend to anyone who wants an inexpensive but reliable finder.
5,Love this garmin I’m using it on my jet ski perfect not too big not too small can read the letters read the depth is most important for me on a JetSki.
5,Works well just as described depth is a little slow when going over 30 mph but works great when going under that.
5,Great product for the price easy to use!
5,Worth every dime
5,Affordable
5,Excelent
5,Good
5,Works great in the boat
5,Muy buena calidad.
5,I love everything about this unit it’s perfect for a jon boat
5,Finds fish. Tells you the depth of the water. Easy to use. Can take it out and put in house for protection.
5,Great
2,I buy it to be a gift and package look like is used or refurbished
5,Was a gift. But have had no complaints yet
5,awesome
5,AAAAA++++
5,Without reading manuals I quickly and easily installed this on a 8ft 2-seat mini bass boat. Once on the lake it was quickly giving me readouts of bluegill at 10ft. So many custom settings and waypoint (hey this is Garmin folks) options to choose. If using a trolling motor mount the transducer on the motor with supplied kit. The unit will handily give voltage readouts so no more guessing how much charge is left for return to shore.
5,Great functions for the price. No pre-loaded nautical maps but the GPS makes up for it for most uses.
4,it fill my needs an was as advertised for the money could not beat price
5,Works really well with my kayak. Really use friendly and to add a great price.
1,Installed this unit according to instructions and the unit won't even power up. Customer is expected boat tomorrow so I am forced to go purchase something locally as it will take a week minimum to get a replacement. Total waste of money
5,I hooked this up to my kayak. No issues. Happy with purchase.
5,Wiring is flimsy otherwise good product
5,Received on time and was packaged well. Set it up on kayak and looks great. Haven’t used it on water - temps in the 20’s - but looking forward to going next week when it warms up. Will update if anything fails. Otherwise 5 Stars.
4,I've had Lowrance and Hummingbird fish finders they were OK but didn't last for what they cost.  So I've been buying Garmin and have two one a Stricker 7SV several years old and just recently bought the Stricker 4.  I bought the Stricker 4 to mount on my Minn Kota Power Drive trolling motor.  The Stricker 4 has the hardware included that one needs for either a trolling motor mount or a fixed boat mount.  I haven't had the Stricker 4 in the water yet it winter here.  However if it's anything like the other Garmin I'm sure it will be fine.  I might suggest you Google how to install a depth finder on a trolling motor some good how to videos that will keep you out of trouble.  If I had a complaint about the Garmin it would have to be their electrical and transducer connectors into the back of the unit they are a bit testy.
5,I like the size of the Striker for kayak use. It gives me all the info I need without taking up much space. It doesn't need a giant battery either - also saving weight and space. Is recommend it.
5,I got it used works awsome only problem was the wire had the plastic lightly cut off mabe shipping or something but that wasn’t in description but it worked amazing I did notice transducer was jumping the other day and I don’t want to blame the wire yet will update could have been low battery mabe idk
5,I installed this on my kayak and it works GREAT. Nice and small ... doesn't take up a lot of room on the kayak. I installed the transducer from inside the hull.
5,Great GPS just wont do what I need
5,works great
5,Absolutely love it
5,This was bought for my dad.  After I showed him on mine how to set it up he installed in on his boat.  Works great for plotting fishing spots and so easy to use out of the box.  If you need a good fish finder without breaking the bank this one is the one to buy.
5,Small but does everything you need it to do
5,Does what we need it to. Accurate. Garmin has always been a reliable product in my opinion.
5,Awesome fish finder with aftermarket sun visor.This fish finder is the best value for the money.Works perfect for a portable setup.Great sonar high quality transducer.Fish alarms depth alarms all customizable. Its awesome.Got this great screen shade visor for it (garmin striker 4 visor) on ətsy.
5,Fantastic unit with too many functions to list.  Easy to use very user friendly.
5,I really like the one I bought almost two years ago for my Feelfree Lure V2 kayak. So when I needed to replace the fish finder on my Bass Tracker TWX it was an easy choice. For the price I don’t believe there is a better option. For me it’s the perfect upgrade. It provides depth water temp locates fish boat speed time of day gps and the ability to mark spots on the water. The location marker is so important for me so I can mark fishing spots to return too. I also like that they don’t take up much space. Definitely recommend for any boat or kayak.
5,Bought this in 2017 and it's been flawless on my Kayak. People that leave negative remarks have no clue. The mount worked perfectly on my kayak and the transducer fit into the bottom of a scupper hole. Easy to wire to a portable 12-volt battery. I guess I'm one of the lucky ones because I've flipped the kayak dozens of times and the fish finder still works after being soaked. I would recommend this unit to anyone looking for a good fish finder in a small portable package. I was going to upgrade to a unit with side imaging in 2019 but wasn't willing to take a chance on it NOT performing as well as this one has.
3,I bought this because of all the good reviews on YouTube the only problem I have is the transducer cable will not reach to the bow the boat from the stern  it’s a 17 foot bass boat !!!!! most bass boats are over 17 ft why the hell Garmin made the cable too short is beyond me  so fair warning transducer cable will not fit even a 16 foot boat unbelievable
5,After much research I bought thus unit as a gift for a real catch/release person he loves it once the season has started I should know more. Unit is very responsive and the price is right.
5,Funciona a la perfección la verdad solo lo he podido usar una vez y es de mucha ayuda en la localización de peces aunque eso no garantiza una buena pesca al menos reduce el desgaste de estar haciendo tiros a ciegas.
5,Will keep you posted. Looks good tho
5,Muito feliz com as pescarias
5,Lo compré como un regalo para mi papá y le encantó hasta ahora se la ha pasado buscando excusas para ir a usarlo. Muy bueno cabe señalar que no incluye batería se necesita gastar unos 700 pesos adicionales en una batería de plomo de 11 amperes y un cargador para baterías de ácido.
5,This fish finder/flasher works very well; used mainly for ice-fishing.  The cabability to select transducer cone shape and frequency is a real benefit allowing fishing in very shallow (wide cone angle) to very deep water (narrow cone angle).  The gain adjustment works very well to thin out interference and other noise.  Can still see hooks jigging at over 100 ft of depth.  For suspended fish crank the hook up to them and BAM!  Worth every penny.  I power it with a small motorcycle battery and can get two full days of use without a recharge.  Great setup.
5,Highly affordable alternative to the more expensive sonar units this does a fine job of clearly displaying the ground under your keel or skeg while showing all the fish you never thought were there. Its GPS and compass functions are handy particularly as a knotmeter. Some customization is possible the image is great in full sun. You can pay more but you will have to pay a lot more to get something better.
3,Very disappointed with swivel mount that comes with it. Monitor barely hangs on it by a little bit of plastic and a plastic tab that released it. Doesn't take much to release it so if it falls off into the lake there goes $200+ dollars down the drain. Garmin doesn't offer and float leash or lanyard that is compatible with this product and there isn't any 3rd party products either.
5,Very happy with purchase. Colour screen is simple and easy to read even in sunlight. Shows bottom detail and fish well. Mounting system allows you to quickly remove the unit if needed. Flexible power requirements of 10V to 20V. Overall a quality item.
5,Realmente superó mis expectativas ampliamente recomendable. Normalmente lo uso en presas (agua dulce) su gps tiene bastante presicion y la sonda me a ayudado a mejorar la talla de mis capturas y me gusta mucho poder grabar los puntos de pesca.
5,For the price this is the best sounder on the market. Colour and detail are excellent. I have a 16' aluminum boat and have consistently found bait (and caught fish) using this sounder. Also uses the same hardware and mounting screw locations as the Echo 150 so if you have a 150 you don't need to change transducers or re-wire power just plug and play which is a total bonus. Nice work Garmin.
5,bought for ice fishing and works great. It’s also great for summer in the boat.Can really see the fish on it clear and crisp. Flasher mode is awesome for ice fishing. Shows lure quality good and has a gps waypoint map so ya can mark those hot spots for return later fishing definitely recommend this item.
4,Ordered a so called used unit from Amazon and expected it to look like a used unit but to my surprise it was all in new condition. I guess the box was only opened and then returned because everything was still in its original packaging.Unit works good but the screen is a little smaller than I anticipated but otherwise its all good.It came in soon that expected!
5,J'adore! Parfait pour la pêche sauf que ce n'ais pas adapté pour le changer souvent d'embarcation et il ne vient pas avec une batterie. Je recommande tout de même si vous avez votre propre embarcation et une batterie 12v!
5,I really like this fish finder not an avid fisherman just go out every once in awhile but I always turn it on when I'm boating. gives me piece of mind knowing the depths of the water. Easy to use
5,Excelent product. I am very happy with it. Perfect for lakes and rivers that tou are familiar with. If you are afraid of rocks during navigation i would recommend a Garmin that has a map.
1,It worked before. There's a fuse on the red wire but that seems okay. No idea. I've never been able to get the GPS to work. The product is flaky. I'm very disappointed. I should probably return it now but have decided to buy a set of fuses and try to swap the fuse out. Just wasting good money after bad most likely. Thanks for nothing Amazon!
5,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband not knowing it needs a battery and case. Now we’re having to buy that separately and it’s more than the full kit.
5,If you're considering purchasing this just do it you wont find anything better for the price. If I had to complain about anything it would be the smaller screen but I knew that when purchasing. Used it for ice fishing so far but will work on my boat in the spring no problem. Lots of settings and functions I love it
5,This is a great fishfinder and really good value for money. I replaced an old black and white unit that was 3 times the size and now I can see much more detail.  Love the fact it also shows GPS coordiantes and has a man overboard feature. I installed inside my glass fibre boat using slow setting expoxy rather than mounting over the back (the back of my boat is rounded so was not possible) and it still works really well
5,Can't beat the price. Basic requirement for a newbie to the world of fish finders (got it mostly for the depth finder - will be trying the other features out in the near future).
5,Unit works great for the price range and alternative options in the similar range it takes the crown! Well done Garmin! Not as good as the clearvu units but if adding to an already cheap rig (12’ aluminum) it works great!!! 👍👍 two thumbs!
3,Installed on boat using it for depth and gps.I suddenly lost everything I had saved and set up. No more previous trails or settings I had set up. Sometimes it wont power up I have to unplug it and plug back in. Not very impressive.
5,Awesome fishfinder. 10x better than hummingbird. You get speed and temp for free. The versatility of this finder allows me to use my cordless dewalt 20v drill batteries to power it
5,Still figuring out all the features but so far loving it.
5,Easy to install and setup nice and bright in full daylight.
5,Buen producto es mas de lo que esperaba excelente vendedor trato responsable recomendado al 100%
5,Surprisingly great little unit for my 14ft boat. I rhought the screen would be too small but its bright and sharp.
5,It works as it should. For the money I'm very pleased.
5,tenia mis dudas pero cumplio las expectativas cuando lo probe recién instalado fuera del agua no marcaba profundidad del agua pero una ves en el lago no me dio ningún problema se porto a la altura y me dio buenas capturas.
5,Works great I made it portable and use it for ice fishing. Only thing I am not happy with is the price of an ice transducer. I would like to buy one but I can’t justify paying the price for one.
4,Nice finder for under 200 bucks lots of options ( flasher course plotting gps) comes with bow mount trolling motor accessories which is great because I bought this to set up in the front of the boat for when im running my bow mount motor.
5,It took a couple of hours to install on my Highfield alum dinghy.  Works perfectly first time out.  Absolutely does everything they say.  Caught 4 bass in the first hour of use.  Perfect.
5,Sounder works excellent. Only drawback is small screen.
5,Great product works well. Very easy to navigate and operate.
5,To much work to install sent back
5,Love it to go hiking and fishing
3,Very difficult for a beginner to learn how it’s used. Not what I expected but it tells me how deep or shallow the water is which is why I wanted it
5,Great product shipped fast and exactly as it shows onlineHave used the product for 2 months and would highly recommend
5,Bang for buck a great little unit. Pretty basic but does everything I need it to. Super happy.
5,Best value for what you get
5,Amazing quality for the price and so easy to use.
5,il va super bien je vous le conseil
4,Doesn't show fish easily. a fish is just a curved smudgenot like a fish shape in other models
5,Works great
5,Love this deviceShows the depth of the water and you see the fish under the boat
5,good

5,GOOD PRICE AND WORKS GREAT!
3,It's a great value for the price and is far superior to the old unit I have.It's supposed to be waterproof but it isn't. Mine fogs up if it gets wet
5,I bought this item around 6 months ago and decided to review it once I tried the ice fishing flasher.  I was skeptical about it at first mainly because of the cost of the unit but I am very impressed with it. I am using the transducer that the unit came with.  You can clearly see a small jig on the display and when jigging up and down there does not appear to be any delay from when you make a move with you rod to when the display shows the movement. I only tried the unit in roughly 20 feet of water. I also just built a box as the ice fishing case is pretty much the same as what I paid for the unit. The only tricky thing is getting the transducer to sit level in the water but not really an issue. I was fishing with guys using a vexillar flasher and a Marcum flasher and I would say this unit is very comparable aside from battery life I haven't really got to test the battery life.
5,It's a decent little fishfinder/GPS for the cost.  There are no maps/charts loaded or available on the GPS -- it's an old style unit that simply tracks your route to make it easy to find your way home.Simple to install.  Connect to power (make sure it's fused) and run the cable for the Sonar.  I mounted the sonar unit inside the hull using 3M 5200 adhesive and it seems to work well to track the bottom (note that this is not the recommended mounting option).  It's a Chirp Sonar unit so uses multiple frequencies across a range so is less prone to interference.  So far so good.
5,This is a great rig. Bought it for ice fishing and it works great. For the price you can’t beat it. Has a lot of features. Will also use this in my boat.
4,nice unit but instruction manual is needed no instruction for set up.
5,A1 looks good have not used it yet.
4,bought this for my kayak and have it installed. looks great but need to get it on the water for final test. Just what i wanted.
5,good
2,Missing transducer
1,did not work i returned it
3,I wish I had spent a little more on a better unit same company even.  thought It would do a little more but works
5,I'm using it for ice fishing.The flasher is every nice the display is adapting depending on the death of the water.I didn't buy the ice fishing transducer it's way too much expensive. The one that came with it isn't the best for ice fishing. The way it hangs in the water it may be hard to have it oriented at the bottom. But it does the job.I instead of buying the kit which was also too expensive I build one by myself with that battery:   APC Back-UPS ES 550 8 Outlet 550VA BE550R 12V 7Ah UPS Battery        .The flasher is always working very well even in the cold Canadian winters.I highly recommend it for every beginner who doesn't want to pay a fortune and know what's going on below the ice!I only need to catch fish now!!
3,The product is fine but we got caught out with a large customs bill as it came from France. Will avoid European sellers in future
3,Screen is clear and is easily readable I have had some pretty major problems though with the transducer and how accurate it is every time I mark a fish it will show at least four of them on the screen all bunched together all different size. Also anytime i am in a weedy area it starts marking tonnes of fish and the depth goes all wacky doesn't help when I am relying on the shallow depth alarm if the depth screws up anytime I'm in weeds (usually a shallow area) overall if you want something to tell you how deep the water is (in anything deeper then 4 feet) then it will work for you but if your wanting a fish finder to help you make fish then invest in something on the higher end I don't trust this fish finder at all for getting me on fish
5,Amazing sonar for price! Great features and functions. I built a portable unit for ice fishing works far better than expected. Runs for two long solid days on a charge. I built this unit for just under $200. Here’s what to do.. get everything here 3 gallon bucket striker unit 7 amp hour sealed liquid acid battery pack of 14/16 gauge electrical female connectors 850 milliamp 12 volt charger gorilla tape. Drill two holes in lid for cables mount unit to lid secure battery to bucket bottom with tape join and crimp wires secure charger to top of battery(it’s small) connect wires to battery presto! Chunk of pool noodle covered in gorilla tape as a float. Portable fish finder with integrated charger that stores neatly inside its self.
5,I purchased this fish sounder for my sons 14ft boat. We mounted the equipment with ease and setup was a brease. Has some great features for split screen for the GPS and sounder and like the fact we can mark out fishing spots we like. Will mainly be used in the salt water fishing in the Pacific West coast seems to be a good value for small boat fishing.
4,I am impressed with this unit despite an anomally my screen developed a brightness issue a little over a month on our pontoon boat.I would have given it 4 Stars instead of 5 but Amazon's incredible customer service bumped my rating to 5 stars since they were so accomodating to replace my defective unit despite the return window being closed!As far as this Garmin Striker goes it is an awesome finder in an easy to use and view package. The install was flawless for a first time installer. Watch a few youtube videos on transducer installations to assist your install. Also place your finder in a location that you can see while moving around your boat in our case a 20' pontoon boat. The finder can rotate in place so leave enough room on your power cable and transducer cable in order for it  to do so.  Despite the smaller screen it is easy to see anywhere on our boat.The chirp transducer is amazing very quick and accurate. Again watch a few youtube videos on setting up a fish finder and what options too choose for your needs.For the price and the ratings this unit offers a lot for the money. If Amazon didn't replace it I was looking at purchasing it again I liked it that much. I also searched to see if others experienced their screen having issues this search found no other reported problems which lead me to believe that my unit was an anomally time will tell and I will add to this review if any other issues develop. Therefore no updates no negatives...all good!UPDATE: 08/18It looks like the second Striker has the same issue as the first one had! The screen has turned so dark I cannot see any images on it! I am so disappointed that it has happened again.After some research on Youtube this does happen on some units the screen will go dark. The fix is turn the unit on press the √ key then the cursor key > which brightens the screen again back to your normal settings. I will give this a try hopefully that is the solution since I really do like this model and features.Stay tuned...
5,This lil thing is amazing! For the price I was on the fence. But WOW... Absolutely love it. I bought mainly for ice fishing. It is a shame the ice transducer cost more then the unit it self.  But the regular transducer mounted so it sits level to the hole still works great. . %100 recommend this unit. Not only for the price but for anyone looking for a small lightweight power house like this. . two thumbs up.
5,I am very impressed with this depth sounder and it has more features than I'll ever use. I mounted it on my eight foot fiberglass dingy that I use with an electric trolling motor for trout fishing on small lakes and I have no complaints. One issue though is I don't care for the cartoon like fish that show up on the screen whenever you pass over something in the water column like in the photo I took (apologies for the dust on my camera lens). What looks like a mother load of fish is actually a submerged tree twenty feet below but the fish almost make this thing look more like a toy than the top notch sounder it is.
5,Did exactly as it said it would. Love the big numbers for depth...fish finder works great to....I put this on my 21 ft Bayliner cuddly cabin. It had lots of cable and easy to install.
5,Excelente producto cumple con su función y viene con todo lo descrito en la publicaciónel tiempo de envio fue rápido.
5,Excelente producto! Fácil de usar ideal para embarcaciones pequeñas o para novatos que empiezan en el deporte de la pesca. Muy recomendable y el precio super bien !! Amazon tiene muy buen servicio de entrega en todo momento sabes dónde está tu envío
5,Great product for the cash very happy with purchase
5,Converted to be portable. The total cost of this device was 190.00. Ice fishing and moving to my smaller boat. Cannot add maps but it has lots of memory for way points.
1,Found some scratches on transducer. Sealing on joint is broken. Looks like a used one is packed.
5,Bon produit pour le prix
5,Love mine friends actually prefer it over their $800 ones!
5,This works perfectly for my needs and my pleasure craft experiences. It installed easily and and is removable during storage.
5,Gps
5,Love it

5,Great Little fish finder reviews speak for themself.
3,No value for money
5,この金額で、この性能言うことありません！残念ながら日本語の説明がないのと日本語モードがないのがとても残念😢もう一つ言うとgps機能があるけど上手くつかえてないので宝の持ち腐れになっています😢
5,欲を言えば海底の起伏や漁礁を勝手に地図にしてくれるクイックドローの機能が欲しいところですが、お金がないのでこれで十分です。ベイトフィッシュさえ分かれば問題なし。ポイント登録もできますし、スピードや水深もわかるので助かります。
4,長年使ったローランスからの買い替えです。性能は数ある口コミ通り。画面が小型化した分、レンタルボートで見やすく固定するために取り敢えずカメラ用の三脚を取り付けてみたものの、頼りない。揺れに耐えられるか。クランプ固定も思考しつつ、まず実釣に挑みます。
4,日本語の取扱説明書が必要です。
4,2021年、カヤックで湖と海で３０回位使用しました、振動子のシーリングに関しては私の物も隙間が有るように見えますが、全く何もせずに、そのまま使用しても問題は無さそうです、それよりも本体との接続コネクタに海水が付いたまま放置すると緑青がでます、洗浄清掃が必要です、操作に関しては英語表記ですが何となく分かる部分と全く理解不能の部分が有りますが実際の釣行では不便を感じていません、水深　水温　移動速度　時刻　電圧が全て確認出来るので重宝しています、海のカヤックで必死にパドリングしても進んでいない錯覚に陥る事が時々ありますが、この魚探で確かに前進している事が確認できるのでその点が大変良いです。
4,サップで釣りをするのに購入しました。この値段でこの性能は買って満足ですが、説明書と表示が　英語とせめて日本語の説明書があれば良いと思います。でも皆さんYouTubeとかで設定が丁寧にあがってるので面倒ですが問題ありません。あとバッテリーが別なのと振動子の取り付け加工を自分でやらないといけないので各自創意工夫が必要ですつけるとつけないじゃ大違いなので頑張って取り付け加工しましょう
4,製能　コスパは文句のつけどころないんですが　説明書が英語だけでYou Tubeで取り扱いみてなんとかできましたがGPSの使い方はまだまだ分かっていません
5,画面は英語表記ですけど、検索すれば操作方法が沢山アップされてますし、操作自体は難しくありません。釣果も上がり文句なしの一品ですが、多少重くても充電式なら最高だと思います。
5,レンタルボートのバックシートで使っています。設定も必要な箇所はいくつも無いので、初めての人でも使いこなせます。逆に言えば高機能ですが、使う機能は一部しか無いと言うことですねｗ10000mAhのモバイルバッテリーで丸1日使えますよ。
4,ワカサギ釣り用に購入。モバイルバッテリーでの電源供給で使用。昇圧ケーブル等必要だったが問題無く動いた。（モバイルバッテリーの防寒対策は必要）本体自体は英語表記だが、ユーチューブの動画見て、触っていればなんとなくわかる感じで問題なし。魚探が反応すると当たりが来るのは面白かった。振動子をうまく固定するのに工夫が必要か。コスパが良く買ってよかった。
4,毎釣行後はケーブルを外し水道水で丸洗いしています、約1年 電極錆など不具合無しです。使用バッテリーはバイク用の12V 3Ah筏・カセで納竿時11.7Vほどで安定しています、フル充電で何時間使えるかは未測定。写真は撮影のため室内でデモモードで表示は実釣ではありません。※自分の仕掛けでおもり、こませかご＆オキアミはしっかり映ります。
5,良い
4,日本語のマニュアルあれば
4,初めての魚探でボート釣り用なので簡単な物で良いとストライカー4を選びました　取説が全て英語なので苦労しましたが最後はYouTubeの投稿を見て初期設定する事が出来ました3.5インチの画面は小さくなく綺麗で見やすく本体も小さいので邪魔にならず使い勝手が良くとても満足しています　早速　海に出て使ってみるとソナーが反応せず故障かと思い帰宅して色々調べた結果失敗の原因が解りましたので参考にして下さい1.本体設定後にソナー(振動子)取付て正常に作動するか確かめる　振動子を耳に当ててポツポツとかカリカリという音が出ているか　水を入れたバケツにソナーを入れて水温が出るかを確かめる2.ソナーの取り付けは出来るだけ船外に取り付ける　船底(船内)に付けるとGAINが低下する　また船底に取り付ける場合は絶対に両面接着テープを使ってはいけない　シリコンボンドで接着する3.実際に使って川底や海底が画面に出ない時はカーソルキーの上下ボタンかメニューからrangボタンを押して実際の深度より数メートルの深さにセットすれば底の画面が出て来る　ソナーのgain は最初はmaxにしておく方が良い4.電源ケーブル(赤と黒)以外の線は触らない　誤ってバッテリーに触れない様にする5.電源とソナーの接続端子ゴムカバーは簡単に外れるので紛失しない様にインシュロック等でケーブルに固定しておくのが確実ですその他のトラブルはガーミン　サポートセンターで検索すれは゛解決できるでしょう電源は軽四用のバッテリーが家に有ったのでそれを使っていますが　殆ど電力を消費しないのでもっと小型の物で良いでしょう　ガーミンストライク4は初心者用にしては必要にして十分過ぎる魚探だと思います
4,安いし、必要な機能はついているので、ライトユーザーの自分には十分すぎる性能。カヤックで使っていますが、頑張っても水深70メートルくらいまでしか行かないので、これで十分対応できました。
4,海で使っていましたが、水で使う商品であるにも関わらず、３回目の使用で壊れました。２ヶ月が過ぎていたので販売店もアマゾン も返品交換対応できず。よくみたら振動子のプラの繋ぎ目が甘いので、中に水が入ったよう。最悪。
5,多機能で高性能でこの価格は他にないでしょう。
4,魚探として普通に使えるのですが、色々とついている機能が英語表記のためわかりません！サイズ的にはカヤックや小型ボート向けサイズです。振動子が大きいので取り付け場所は少し悩むと思います。カラーでGPSがついてこの値段ならありですねでもGPSは地図と連動しているわけではないので、あまり使わないですよ。速度計程度でしょうかねえ
4,先日レンタルボートで釣りに行った際に取り付けて使用しました。取扱説明書には日本語文がないので、動画等で設定して使用しましたが基本的な機能は使えていると思うが、もっと高度な付属機能を使うには説明書が無いのは痛いところです。実際に使用してみて感じたところは、この価格では十分な仕事をしてくれる機器だと思います。
4,初心者や英語が苦手な方には使いにくいですね。設定では日本語がありません。初期設定から英語表記なのです。感度などには問題ありませんでした。船外に振動子を固定するには専用か自作が必要です！
3,先日商品の不具合（電源が入らない）があったので交換の旨を質問したのですが返品処理になっています交換をお願いしたいのですがどの様にすれば良いのでしょうか？
5,ワカサギ釣りに使用振動子の取り付けに工夫がいります振動子のケーブルは硬くて癖がとれません使い方はネットで調べる必要があります電源は12V必要ですワカサギの群れが表示された画像を添付しました場所は桧原湖です
3,画面小さいが見やすいワカサギ釣りならこれで充分
4,コストパフォーマンスは良いですね。普通に使えます。
4,全て英語、ネツトで調べて何とか使える様になりました。日本語の説明書が有れば五つ星
4,実際に船に付けて使ってみました。画面は小さいけど見やすく使い易かったので、金額からすれば最高の商品です！
4,小型で軽く扱いがよいが日本語の説明書がないから非常にわかりずらい
4,過去のレビューで、深度表示がでたらめ、とレビューしましたが、その後自分のセッティング（トランスデューサー）に問題があることに気づき、修正後再度ワカサギにトライしたところ、問題なく利用できたので、レビューを削除しました。業者にはご迷惑をおかけし申し訳なく思っています。ホンデックスを使ったことはないので、詳細な比較はできませんが、多機能であること、価格を考慮すれば遜色はないと思います。過去に購入した1万円以下のちゃちな魚探とは比べ物にならない、本格的で良い製品です。欠点としては、トランスデューサー固定の必要性（もっとも固有の問題ではありませんが）、別にバッテリーが必要なこと（同）、バッテリーへの配線が細くて簡単に切れてしまったこと（補強済み）くらいでしょうか。星4つはそのためです。ただ、コストパフォーマンスに優れていることは間違いなく、買って後悔することはないでしょう。
4,GPS機能付きで耐久性も高くバッテリーの持ちも良いと思います、取説に日本語が無いこととソナーを固定するのが初心者向けではありませんが非常に良い商品です。
5,コンパクトですが鮮明な液晶で見やすく、細かな設定以外は無駄に操作は必要ないため初心者でも簡単です。１つのソナーで水深や温度を表示するのはもちろんですが、地形や魚影をしっかり表示しますので釣果に繋がります。拘る方は日本語の正規品となりますが、ソナーとして使用中には英語モデルで支障ありません。それと皆さんが不安視するソナーのパッキン不良ですが、あれははさめて締める防水パッキンではなくて内部にしっかり充填して固めてある完全防水の物です。充填して蓋をするため途切れてるように見えますが立派な良品です。無知な方が外側からの見た目で不良品扱いしていますが鵜呑みにされないで下さい。ちなみに本体も防水で、海で使用後など丸洗いできます。非常にオススメ出来る商品です。
5,コスパは良いです。値段の割には使えます。英語表記なので使いこなすには時間がかかります。
4,普通に使えると書きたいところだが、英語の解らない自分には使えない機能があり過ぎな気がする。基本的な情報が分かるだけでも釣りをする上で違ってくる。使える人には値段的にみてお得だと思う。
5,初心者にも使いやすい商品でした！知人にもオススメしました！
5,極寒の北海道でテント内ワカサギ釣りで使っています。1.6マンくらいでこの性能は素晴らしい。日本語表記はありませんが、適当にいじっているとほぼ理解できます。春になったらプレジャーボートでも使ってみます。
4,水温・時計機能も精度高く他船と隣接してもノイズあまりでません！！自信をもってお勧めします！！
4,SUPフィッシング用に購入日本語不対応や12vのバッテリー接続、振動子の取り付け場所などいろいろあって初心者にはオススメしませんが、金額的にこの性能はヤバイです。タイラバの軌跡もわかります。あとSUPには12vのリチウムバッテリーがオススメです。
5,とても気に入りました！レンタルボートで使いましたが振動子もイケスに入れるだけで使えました。タイラバ、ジギングなどベイトもしっかり写るのでかなりいいです。
5,カヤックフィッシングに使用してます。初めての魚群探知機には機能、コストのバランスのとれた商品だとおといます。
3,安価で本格的な魚探が購入出来るのは、非常に評価出きるが、振動子のシーリング不足に当たってしまった。他の方も同様の報告があるので、それなりの発生率だと思われます。返品すれば良いのだろうが、面倒だし時間も掛かる。手間賃なんか出ないし、完全に此方の負け。こういう商品だと思うしか無い。シーリング剤で塞いで使用しますが、耐久性に疑問はあります。＜使用後の感想＞画面は小さいが、明るさは充分で見やすい。省電力なので、12VのPD出力対応のモバイルバッテリーを変換器を通して使用しましたが、20000mAhだと一日（6時～16時）使っても半分も使用していなかった。10000mAhで充分だった。シーリング不足さえ気を付ければ、非常にお勧めです。
4,ワカサギのドーム船で使用するため購入。画面が小さいですが魚の群れを映すのには必要十分です。寄せエサのぶどう虫の内容物が飛び散る様子等の細かい様子はわかりづらいです。また自分の重りの場所も設定によっては映りづらいと思います。振動子の性能のせいかもしれませんが・・・。水深カウンターのあるリールと併用することをおすすめします。
5,いままで球体を浮かせるタイプの魚探を使っていたのですが、精度は悪いし、カヤックで移動中は計測できないので、ガーミンに変更しました。結論からいうと正解でした。まず感度が非常に良いです。落としたジグ、改修中のジグもくっきり見えますし、それを追っかける魚の反応もわかります。この機能が2万円以内で買えるとは。もっと早くこちらにしておけばよかったな。ただし水深50mくらいまでが限度かな。
5,（良い点）◯  GPSが付いてこの値段はかなりお値打ち◯  周波数も２種類あるし、自分の落としたジ  グやタイラバ もリアルタイムで表示される  程、感度も応答速度も良好◯  輝度も十分で、日照時の視認性も良好◯  デザインも悪くない◯  防水性能も十分（悪い点）◯  バッテリー等との外部接続が必要◯  白地図◯  スコッティーマウントとの互換性がないの  で台座を作る必要あり（他メーカーに合うも  のがあるのかも？）◯  日本語表記がない
4,4月23日に湘南に出かけカヤックで初めてガアミン魚探を使ってみました。沖に漕ぎ出してスピードの確認OK、水深表示もOK、魚影の確認では大型の魚影は確認できなかったもののイワシらしき群れは確認出来ました。出掛ける前に概ねセッティングはしたつもりでしたが、日本語の説明書が無いためか、GPSの画面に出かけた陸地が表示されません、出来れば簡単な日本語の説明書を付けてくれればと思っています。
4,設定など英語でなんとなくわかりますコ・ス・パおすすめです日本語対応にだったら最高です
5,ワカサギ  氷上用に購入自分が釣る場所は深度10m未満のため、付属の振動子で充分オモリ　仕掛が見えるサカナの存在もわかる　GPSで時間もと1.5万円とは思えない性能難点は電源の確保　12vのバッテリー必要（中学技術程度のスキルも)、アイスドリル用の電ドラのバッテリーから変換で対応振動子設置　単純に吊り下げると鉛直が出ないので100均アルミパイプと付属のパーツでなんとか角度を固定
4,ワカサギ釣りに使用。日本の有名メーカー製と比較しても遜色ない。バッテリーをどうするかが星4つの理由。私はポータブルの車バッテリージャンパーを使用。電気の知識があれば何とかなる。
5,コスパ最高の魚探です！
5,入門用には最適
5,カヤック用に購入しました。並行品な為、説明書が英語で操作・設定を心配していましたがyoutubeや各サイトなどで設定方法がたくさん開設されていたので使用に全く問題なしでした。　海外製のため防水を疑っていましたがそこも問題なしです。　安くていいものを探しているならおすすめです。
4,まだ使用してませんが楽しみです。あとは操作に慣れないとですね！夏に使用しましたが水深のメーター数が突然半分ぐらいに変わったりまた元の水深数にもどったりするトラブルがありました。まだ一度の使用なので本当のトラブルか分かりませんが、振動子がわるかもですね。
4,まず、とても良い買い物でした。魚探としてしか使用してませんが、水深30メートルのポイントで鯛ラバの沈下、浮上の軌跡が割りとハッキリ表示されました。ベイト等も良く映っています。また、画面照度を上げれば、夏場でも良く見えます。フルセットでの価格としては大変満足です。ただフィート表示は慣れるしかありませんね😁
5,鮮明に映りますシグの落ちていくところまで映ります。日本語の説明書がついてればなおよいかとなのでYouTubeで初期設定の動画あるので参考にしてください❗
5,ワカサギドーム船で使用してみました。ホンデックス魚探を使っている方がたくさんいたためか、ノイズは入りましたが魚影がばっちり映し出されました。振動子はフロートタイプではありませんが、ケーブルの長さを調節して垂らしておけばOKです。バッテリーは海釣り電動リール用の小型バッテリー「フィッシングキューブ5Ah」を使用し、8時間の実釣で残量インジケーターは半分でした。なお、バッテリー接続のケーブルは末端の処理がされていませんので、別途ワニ口クリップを同時注文しました。日本語対応していませんが、平易な英語ですので難なく使用できると思います。実際の画面はすごくキレイです。傷つかないよう、3.5インチ用の保護フィルムを貼ることをおすすめします。耐水性についてはドーム船での使用だと判定が難しいのですが、ケーブルの接続端子は水にある程度強そうな感じです。年に数回ワカサギドーム船での釣りをし、魚探も使ってみたいという方にはこの価格なら十分満足できる商品だと思います。2022/02/03追記昇圧ケーブルをアマゾンで購入し、モバイルバッテリーで稼働するようにしました。コンパクトになりました。
4,水深を知りたいだけの僕には十分でした。次は上のグレードも狙ってみたいですね。
5,レンタルボート用のマイ魚探として購入。この値段の魚探としては充分な機能を持っています。英語だけなのが残念ですが、慣れたら気にならないと思います。
4,魚探ソナーでは、性能自体がよく、G P S機能もあって、申し分ないです。納得する商品を購入でき満足しています。
3,中身は新品が入っていましたが、箱の潰れ中の仕切りがなかったり明らかに一度開封した形跡があったので大丈夫か不安になった。
5,I didn’t use in the sea yet only tests in my home. It’s excellent.
5,コスパがハンパないとにかく多機能
5,安価なのにしっかりした基本機能がよい。この価格でGPSが付いているのも凄いが、HONDEXのPS-500Cも使用していたがガーミンの方がコンパクトで使いやすい。エンジン付きボートの際はHONDEXでカヤック釣りの手漕ぎの場合はガーミンの方がよい。魚探の性能自体も優秀でしっかり魚影など認識できる。バッテリーの消費も少ないのでモバイル１２V（SUAOKI）で余裕で1日釣り業ができます。
5,ワカサギのボート釣りに使用。魚探は初めてだったが操作がシンプルなので特に取扱説明書を読まなくても問題なく使えます。表示内容も安価な魚探のように簡易的なものでなく本格的。仕掛けが落ちていく軌跡もはっきりと映し出されるので棚カウンターの無い手巻きリールでも中層の群れに仕掛けを入れることができます。取説は英語ですが、付属のものはもともと取り付けパーツの組立説明くらいしか書いてないのでイラストのみで判断できます。ちゃんとした取説がなくて困るのはどんな機能があるかが細かく把握できないことですが、海外モノですがYouTubeの「Garmin Striker 4 Sonar Features」「Garmin Striker 4 Waypoint  GPS Navigation Features」で細かくレビューしてくれてますので英語が分からなくてもどんな機能があるかだいたい分かります。私がワカサギ釣で便利と感じているのは「Zoom」と「A-Scope」です。私がよく行く釣り場は水深10m前後ですが、ベタ底で反応が出ることが多く湖底と魚影の判断が紛らわしいのですが、「Zoom」で底を拡大表示することで画面が小さくても判断しやすくなります。「A-Scope」は商品説明にもあるフラッシャー表示を円ではなく通常表示の横に縦に表示してくれるもので魚影の分布をリアルタイムで判断しやすくなっています。GPS機能は便利そうですが、よく行く場所なのでポイントは周辺の景色で判断できてしまうので使っていません。バッテリーは付いていないので別で準備する必要がありますが、手近で好みのものを使用状況に応じて選べるのでかえって便利かも。私は「LONG WP5-12E 12V5Ah」を使っていますが、7:00～16:00までつけっぱなしで問題なく使えています。振動子は付属の取り付けパーツを一部利用してホームセンターで買ったアルミアングルと組み合わせてレンタルボート専用にコンパクトなものを自作して取り付けています。他の魚探とあれこれ比較してけっこう迷いましたがこちらを購入して良かったと感じています。とにかくコスパは高いと思います。
5,魚探は初めてです、説明書が英語なので適当に使ってますがアイコンが分かりやすく魚探機能は使えてます。バッテリーは最初にバイク用 バッテリー     BTX4L-BS      を使用、６時間使用してもまだまだ使えるみたいでしたがタブレットで海釣図Ⅴを見る為タブの充電も兼ねて大型化しました    LONG 12V 14Ah WP14-12SE      。    防水BOXトラスコ ウォーターガードボックス TWG-108      に収納して     BlueFire 2 IN 1 カーチャージャーUSB電源ソケット LED電圧計付き      を取付て使用してます。振動子は底を濡らしたビニールバケツに海水と入れ船底に置くだけ、走行中も気兼ね無く使え便利です。BOXの蓋は半透明なのでタブも入れて蓋を閉じても見れるので良いです。海釣図と組み合わせて使うと高級な魚探と同等で便利です。小魚のベイトとメバルや底物の反応は良く分かります、アジや青物の反応は釣れても確認できませんが小魚のベイトを追ってると良くつれます。初心者でも十分使え満足しています。
5,素晴らしいです。　カヤック用に購入しましたが、カヤックでは船の上の場所が限られるため、バッテリーは携帯のポータブルバッテリーを購入しました。昇圧のUSBケーブルを購入してギボシにて接続　稼働時間はまだ実釣前なのでわかりませんが本日起動を確認　英語表示の為少々てこずりましたが、とりあえずソナー画面とトラックログだけ確認できたので満足です。　インナーハルではなく、ステーにて外出しした結果、湖にて水深86メーターまで確認できました。試してませんがもう少しなら行けそうです。　まあそもそも、自分の釣りではそんなにディープなところを攻めませんので十分です。^_^　日本語ではないため慣れは必要でしょうがいい買い物をしたと思います。
2,初心者用でもベテランでも使える。ただ、日本語の取り説がないのが駄目なところ。商品自体は良い品だとは思いますが、今、値段を見てみたら、一気に値段が３０００円近く値上がりしている。売れ出した途端にこの値上げは考え物ですね。折角安くて良いものが出たと思っていたのに残念。これからどんどん値上がりしていくのかな？
5,カヤックジギングに使っています。バッテリーを収める一つの解決方法をお知らせします。僕は、Uxcell防水ジャンクションBOXにバッテリーを収め、BOXから出るコードは、防水白いプラスチックコネクタを使いバッテリーの完全防水に気を使っています。海でのジギング、海水がかなりかかります。写真のようにGARMINと防水電源を組み合わせたら、帰宅時に取り外し再充電が楽です。ほんの一つのシステム工作の事例です。防水ジャンクションBOXと防水コネクタは全部Amazonですよ。お値段は合計1500円ちょっとです。本題のGarminですが、凄い性能ですね。機能を使いこなしたいですが、教本か解説本が欲しいです。どこかで使い方講習を開催して欲しいですね。Kayakジギング同好の皆様よろしくお願いします。
5,入門編で利用していますが、安価でコンパクト、ゴムボートに最適ですね。みなさん書いてますが、日本語マニュアルあれば完璧です。
5,全部英語で書いてありますが YouTubeで説明してくれてるのがあるので それを見れば分かりました 笑笑。
5,カヤックフィッシングで使用日本語対応でなくても設定はネットやユーチューブで調べられるので問題なし
2,魚群探知機としてはおまけ程度にしか考えていないので精度は気にしないのですが、また元の場所にすぐ戻ってこれるというGPSを売りにしている商品の割にはあまりGPS感度が良くないのか位置がずれていることがよくあります。
3,12vバッテリーもセットで接続しやすい物があれば助かります。振動子もカヤックに搭載するときは考慮が必要です。
5,とてもコスパ最高の良い商品です。アメリカ製ですが、英語も分かるし、ポルトガル語もわかるので、問題なしです。ゴムボートで使用しましたが、はっきり地形が把握できるので魚が釣れた時に良いヒントになります。どの位の深度でどんな魚が釣れたとか、色々勉強になります。
5,カヤックにて使用しています。某有名な国産メーカーも良いとは思いますがガーミンの方がカヤックには使いやすいと思います。正確に海況がわかり もう無くては釣りになりません。
5,まだ使い切れてない感はあるが、価格以上の性能があると思う。欠点としては日本語マニュアルが無いことと、本体が日本語対応していないこと。ネットで調べれば基本的な使い方はすぐ分かるでしょう。アルミやカヤックを持ってる方やレンタルボートを利用する方にはオススメです。
5,コスパ最高です。GPSは白地図ですが、そこらへんでの釣行なら十分です。フィート表示はメートル表示に直せますよ。カヤックでの使用で内側の底にシーラーで振動子を固定しています。バッチリです。
2,新品で購入するも、別の方のレビューにもあるように振動子に隙間がありました。返品再購入するも、再度同じような状態のものが届きました。すぐ使用予定があり、もう返品等は面倒なため、スーパーX(ブラック)で隙間を埋め自分で修理しました。自分のものは穴自体は貫通していなかったのですが、購入された方は振動子の隙間の確認をされたほうが良いです。性能、使いやすさに関しては必要十分です。
5,価格と性能のバランスはバッチリ…以上です。サイズ感も荷物を減らしたいなかで、現場まではワカサギライブウェルの小さい箱にも入るので良いです。カラー画面で、強い日差しの下でも、見やすいですし、フラッシャー画面で見ていても自分のシンカーが戻って来るのも映ります。^_^GPS付き…ワカサギでは移動しないので使いませんが、時計表示があるのは便利です。振動子の取り付けブラケットはホームセンターで売っている、穴開きの安いステー長、短、各二本と、バイスを組み合わせて適当に作りました。
5,ホンデックス等の魚群探知機と表示される映像は同等以上ですね。200KHz77KHzの二つの音波周波数がサーチするのは、他社製品では上位機種しかないが、ガーミンはローエンド機種でも装備している。単3電池等では無くバイク用などの外部バッテリーを使う事になるが、その分長時間使用出来る事も海上に出る場合は良いと思います。地図は出ないが、位置情報は出るし記録も出来るので、釣果実績ポイントの登録が可能ですね。釣りのときはスマホも持って行くから、地図が出るかはあまり問題にならないと思う。これだけの機能ながらホンデックスとかのローエンドより10000円以上は安い。レクチャー動画がYoutubeに有るので、それで理解すれば日本語表示が無いことが不利にはならないと思います。これはオススメ　買いです。私の20180506のレビュー以降に購入者激増した様な気がします。実際、カヤックやゴムボートで使われているYoutube動画増えましたし。多くの方が喜ぶ役立つ情報であったなら幸いです。
5,３０年ほどＨ社のを船につけてましたが、今回メンテナンスで交換することにしました！価格は以前の１／４ぐらいで、ＧＰＳ機能付き！（o.O) 驚きです！！　カーナビの安い物ぐらいの値段で深度計まで手に入れられるのですから！　だいたい　もともと浮いてる魚が映ろうが映ろまいが、気になりませんから。底の形がわかるだけで十分です！あとはお魚さんはだいたいその日の気分で釣れてくれますから（ｗ）。。。。ちょこっと気になるのは、電源線とかセンサーケーブルが細い！（Ｈ社の物に比べて）電源３ＡのＦＵＳＥなので、４０ｗもないはずですが（センサは２００ｗか？）　まっいいやともかく何度も言いますが　”底の形”　深さ以外は期待してないので。。。。しかも　普段は５０ｍ以下だしね（＾－＾）あとは。。。日本語マニュアルないけど普通にいろんな言葉のマニュアル付！　とか　名前から勝手に想像してた米国製ではなく　どこかに　ＴＡＩＷＡＮ　とか　書いてあったのとか。。。。センサのブラケットがプラスチック製なので船外に付けたらあっという間に壊れそうなのとか。。。。ともかく　気になりません！！センサは船尾じゃなくて船底に付けるし！センサケーブルも５ｍほどあってどこにでも付けられそうだけど。。。上位機種には　画面ズーム機能があるらしいけど、ともかく安いってことで　その他もろもろの７難は　隠れてしまいます（＾－＾）その後２年使用しましたがちゃんと動作(o.O)  その後船丸ごと海水に沈没（水深２ｍ）引き上げた後も　ちゃんと動作したことに更に驚き（元電源は切ってあったので通電はしてなかったですが、ほんとに防水してあった！）
5,数回使用このプライスでかの性能であれば全く問題ないですね。電源はエネループで取ってますが5.6時間くらいの釣行であれば全く問題なかったです。スペースの限られたカヤックなどにはとても便利だと思います、、
5,ワカサギ釣り用に購入しました。モニターは少し小さいけど、低周波 高周波と水温、深度、バッテリー電圧など低価格なのに色々な機能があるので大満足です。
5,振動子を舟の生簀のスカッパーに置くだけで、探知できる。魚群探知器と言う通り、群れはよく表示する。単体はあまり映らない。舟にバッテリーに直接繋いでいるが、電源コードが細くて、何度か接触不良を起こした。太いコードで延長することで、解決した。コスパは最高級と思う。
5,２馬力ゴムボに付けて使っています。ホンデのｐｓ－５００ｃとｐｓ－５０１ｃｎ使ってきましたけどガーミンのほうが水温、ＧＰＵもあって画面もすごく綺麗で見易くて便利ですねー。購入して３日後にゴムボでガーミンを使って釣りに行きました。そしたら真鯛、甘鯛、鬼カザコ、ヒラメ座布団８４ｃｍ釣れちゃいました。（本当です）機能もバッチリで価格もお手頃ですしオススメします。
1,振動子の繋ぎ目に隙間がありました。これでは海水が入り故障の原因になると思うので、即返品です。他の方のレビューにもありましたが、商品が到着したら、よくチェックした方が良いです。販売会社は、検品してから発送しないんですかね。凄く疑問です。
5,本体、マニュアルが日本語対応してないのでまだまだ使いこなせてないかも。ボチボチ使いこなしていくのもまた楽しみかと❗
5,価格の割にはいいと思う。画面が小さいのと、バッテリー別なのが少しネックですね
5,貸しボートに取り付けて使用しています。映像も綺麗で見やすく、しっかり魚に反応してくれています。海外の物なので仕方ないですが、日本語の説明書があると星10個です！バッテリーで使えるのも経済的です。
5,機能は他の魚探と遜色なく使えます。説明書が日本語バージョンがあればさらにいいです。
5,購入してから直ぐに雪が降りゴムボート釣りはまだ冬眠中です。浅場での釣りでカレイなどの底物に反応してくれるか楽しみにしています。遠征での鯛釣りにも期待大ですね。
2,到着後、開梱して確認してみたらソナーセンサーのモールド部分が欠損してます。これだと漏水して故障するのが予想されます。交換を希望したいのですが…
1,商品は初期不良のため、ソナーが認識されなかったので、出品者に交換の連絡を入れましたが、1週間たっても連絡なし。おかげで初のボートフィッシングも台無しでした。アマゾンの返品リクエストがありましたので、なんとか返品できました。ちなみに出品者からは未だに連絡がありません。商品は使用できなかったので商品評価はできませんが、この出品者からは買わないほうが無難です。
5,二馬力ボート用で購入しました。この価格だったら満足ですね、充電池8本使用12Vでは（電池容量によりますが）2時間で電池切れしましたのでバイク用バッテリーをお勧めします。
1,手漕ぎボートの為に購入しましたが、接続してみると振動子が認識されない。他のレビューでもある通り初期不良と思われるので返品いたしました。初期不良が多いようなので釣りに行く前にチェックをオススメします。
1,ボートでのジギングに使用しました。操作は簡単で、画面も、きれいでしたが、３回目の釣行では電源が入らないという事態が発生しました。落としたりした訳でもなく、外観は無傷です。海で使った事で何か問題があったのでしょうか？かなり不満を感じました。
1,他の方もレビューにありますが、振動子のつなぎ目不慮です。返品対応して頂きますが、再度注文するか悩みますね。
1,振動子にコーキングミスがある。予定に間に合わないので自分で埋め合わせしました。残念です。
1,初期設定したあとに、内容の変更をしようと再度電源ONボタンを押したのですが、二度と電源は入りませんでした。明日、釣りに行く予定でしたので、時既に遅し。返品しました。初期不良でも、リカバリー出来るように釣行前に余裕を持っての購入をオススメします。
1,振動子が全く反応しません
1,初期不良で返品、再度　同じ商品を買うのも不安で、国産の魚探にしようか迷っています。
5,I've only used it for ice fishing so far but its great. Half the excitement now is just seeing something show up on the screen
4,Great replacement for basic depth alarm on my boat. However I wish I had paid more attention to features. This model does not 'map' the lake floor and I thought it did. The 'Plus' model is needed for mapping.
5,Perfect when paired with a 12v battery and a pelican case this is a fantastic unit.
3,It was easy to set up. It was also worth the money good quality.
5,Like the color screen. Too bad it's not the clear view sensor that comes with it. Over all it does the job pretty well. I am using it to check the depth water temperature and some time for fishing.
5,Terrific for the money.
5,Ce fishfinder est vraiment impressionnant pour le prix versus ce que tu as comme machine je l'est utiliser avec mon Kayak l'installation sur la coque qui viens avec fonctionne à merveille l'image est net et précis sérieux je le recommande a tous ceux qui désire cette pièce d'équipement c'est vraiment impressionnant je vous le jure 👍👍🤘🤘🤘💪💪💪🐟🐟🐟🐟🐟
5,Parfait
5,This unit works well and is good for what I need. Good quality for the price
5,Came as described and easy instructions on installing
5,Only complaint price is a little higher this time.
5,I can't say it's helped me catch more fish yet but I can say they I know the fish are there now. There is a learning curve and I'd suggest looking up videos that go over the various settings.
5,recebi a minha mercadoria em poucos dias e ja estameitoos utilizando pois esse aparelho é muito aceitono nosso segmento de pesca MUITO BOM O EQUIPAMENTO.. JA COMPREI OUTRO.
5,good product
5,No dislikes so far used for fishing.
4,Aunque no he tenido oportunidad de usarlo lo suficiente lo que he visto me ha gustado pensé que por el tamaño sería difícil de ver pero tiene buena visibilidad
5,I was looking for a decent quality but inexpensive fishfinder and this fits the bill.  I bought it for my 12' aluminum fishing boat.  I've used it quite a few times and even ice fishing a couple times.  It works just fine.  I wish it had charting capabilities but you need to pay for the "Plus" version.nonetheless for a <$200 fishfinder I'm not sure you can ask for much more.
4,It has a very stable reading I would have preferred if the display of the depth is slightly bigger. I have installed the transducer in the the hull instead of at the ransom. It works fine
5,For the price this works amazing! I put it on the side of my battery box and currently am using it for ice fishing. Watching my lure jig on the aquaview and watching my screen it's actually pretty accurate without the ice transducer. Amazing bang for your buck.
5,Very easy to install and very useful with my fishing.
5,Tudo nos conformes. Depois de comprar fiquei com dúvida tem descrição errada do produto achei que tinha comprado com a tela maior.
5,Exactly as advertised. Follow Youtube for instructions and you'll get it up and running in no time.
5,Pêche et ce sonar est très portable reste à assayer sur l’eau
5,Very happy with this product after 2 years of use. I use it for ice fishing a lot and as a mobile unit on the boat.
5,Exactly as advertised. Follow Youtube for instructions and you'll get it up and running in no time.
5,I have nothing that I dislikes on this fish finder
5,Pêche et ce sonar est très portable reste à assayer sur l’eau
5,havent used yet waiting for fishing season
5,Very nice little unit and easy to use
5,If you never have used a fish locator sonar or gps ? Then you will have everything you could possibly need in one little unit  yea it on the smaller side but so is the price and it is  worth every single penny! !  If you like the simple life than you won’t be disappointed .
4,This is a very nice fish and depth finder overall. Good display that is easy to read. My only issue is that I am not able to get a depth reading when I travel over 5-6 mph. Been trying to adjust the angle up or down to no avail. Feel that the transducer is better equipped for kayaks that it is on a vessle that can travel at higher speeds.
2,No NEMA output
3,Lo uso bastante en mi kayak bastante buena la inversion
