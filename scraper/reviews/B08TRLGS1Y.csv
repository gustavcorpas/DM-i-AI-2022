5,This is great.  I used it to hide my Starlink modem in the wall. Easy install.  Looks nice.
4,+ Easy installation of box.+ Trim plate makes installation look good.- Installing an electrical outlet requires cutting/filing the provided knockout (which is too small). I used a utility knife to shave the long sides and a small round file to make room for the electrical box mounting ears on the short sides.
5,Perfect for Samsung frame tv to hide box behind tv. Very simple install
5,Works well just a bit obvious unless hiding it behind a TV.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†I installed my first box about 6 months ago and it was great. I ordered the box with the cord management part. Overpriced but essential for my setup with all the gear I have.Just ordered my 2nd box for a new Samsung Frame TV I'm installing in the bathroom.  It's got a HUGE one box. Huge. Massive. This box fits the one box perfectly!My only con is I wished they had two orientations. One with the electrical cutout on the shorter edge. I installed both of mine with the shorter edge at the bottom or portrait.
4,Great fit great size. Not 5 star because transferring my existing outlet was not easy.
5,Plenty of room inside to fit everything and more.  I have nonstandard spacing studs so I had to install vertically but it worked perfectly
5,Great Product and electrician was very impressed with quality. I order 4 for my Samsung frame TV's
5,AA++
5,This was perfect for my samsung frame TV. I installed the power unit inside this box along with a wifi extender and firestick. The box takes some know-how to make it flush but once installed... perfect.It looks like an AC box or something custom. I painted the panel to match my wall to complete the built-in look. love this box.
3,This was easy to install nothing to it.  I was installing a Samsung frame and needed something to hold the box inside the wall and that's where this comes in.  Although it all worked out well and this is one of the cheaper ones I still think it's a lot for a plastic box.
3,Very flimsy plastic. For the price I expected better... It will work but I'm not impressed. Also accessories are overpriced and given how flimsy this is I suspect that accessories are the same. Ok-ish at best.
4,Overall a nice enclosure sits well in the wall and looks decent. The fact that there isn't a "base" model w/the  internal mount for devices is pretty annoying though...because of how the pics are presented I assumed it was included. Lost a star for that.
5,Used this to store my Samsung One Connect HDMI box for my wall mounted tv. The mount I use is close to the wall so this allowed me to place the extras and wires into the recessed box. Worked beautifully for that purpose. Easy to install even for a novice like myself.
5,Easy to install fits well in the wall and holds the cable box and wires.
5,Allows for no cord clutter works great!
5,
5,Having multiple mounting options large room inside for many items like a small PC and comes with a nice cardboard cover for Pre construction.  A bit larger than others but if want a flush mount TV this is the one to get especially if have accessories want plug in the HDMI and USB ports.
5,Worked perfectly for clean install on 55 Frame TV . One connect box fits perfectly and wired up outlet also .
5,This is a very flexible product. As ordered it did not come with the internal shelf that was shown in pictures.
3,The box is o.k. i assumed it came with the 5" mounting plate because it was shown in pictures and mentioned in add but guess what? This is just a box door and trim ring. Amazon sells the same thing with the mounting plate but its not this one. Worse part is you really cant get the mounting plate separately on amazon so keep that in mind. Im disappointed as i feel the listing was misleading
5,Great quality and easy install
1,The description is misleading "Wi-Fi Transparent" must be the new plastic.  This box was flimsy and flexible if the hole is not cut just perfect the box will flex causing the cover not to snap in tight.  Frame can twist easily and was afraid I was going to break it when tightening tabs.  Unimpressed for $40 bought two but after installing the first one I'm sending the second one back (both would have went back if the hole wasn't already in the wall).
4,It would be great if there was a version of this that was 3.5" deep rather than 3.9" like this one. While this will work for most modern wall depths anyone with dimensional lumber in older built homes might have 2"x3" studs in the wall or lathe and plaster that bleeds into the wall. It's too deep for my situation but I applaud Legrand for having an affordable well thought out in wall box that has an attractive plate cover. I really wish this worked for me.
5,I've used another brand's metal in-wall enclosure in the past. However I prefer this box. The plastic is sturdy enough particularly once it's fastened to the studs and clipped back against the drywall.The wall cavity I installed it in was an irregular 19-inches wide however the drywall clips hold it well particularly once drywall filler was used to seal the gaps around the box. I left some insulation behind the enclosure - so the compressed insulation provides forward pressure on the enclosure while the drywall clips act as a stop. As a result the box is super stable and doesn't move in or out at all.I found a metal electrical box is a perfect fit for the outlet cutouts. Just need to drill 4 small holes in the enclosure plastic and use a low-profile-headed screw to fasten the metal box to the enclosure plastic.The trim and cover provide a smart appearance - although in most cases I expect it'll be hidden behind a wall-mounted TV.
5,works well and looks great
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†Excellent product! Provides hardware to accommodate vertical or horizontal install. Has knock outs on all sides to feed wire in. I especially love the outlet knockout so you can have direct power for a switch or modem. My only cons are the front door is a pain to get on and off. I would prefer a hinged style door but I understand that is tricky to accomplish with an all plastic body. Also the provided ‚Äústencil‚Äù didn‚Äôt take into account splines in all 4 corners so I had to bust out the multi tool and make a couple additional touch up cuts. No big deal though this is a very nice panel for the price. I would highly recommend!

5,Great product a must have to have flash mount TV
5,This worked very well as the recessed box for the LG G1 - and the flange/ trim plate can be omitted making the TV perfectly flush.
5,Est√° hecho de muy buena calidad por el precio.Yo revis√© mi pared y us√© un detector de postes y a√∫n as√≠ la profundidad de la pared no me permiti√≥ empotrar la caja la usar√© para otro proyecto despu√©s üî® üößüì∫
