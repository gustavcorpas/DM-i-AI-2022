4,Update #3 Oct 8_______________I've been using the replacement keyboard for a few weeks now and I've modified my rating (to 4...would give it a 4.8 but just not a 5). And yes it's a keeper. All typos are now my own (although 40% of them are from when I've picked my hands up from the keyboard and don't look to see where I'm putting them back down again). I can type normally again. The space bar is fine. (And FWIW for some reason I was stuck on saying it was LEFT but it was the RIGHT one that was so troublesome. I'm quite fond of the mouse. I'm not experiencing latency which I was getting occasionally with the previous keyboard. I'm no longer fumbling with a dependeny on the ENTER key taht was on the keypad. I love using the keypad when I need to use the calculator and having it aside when I don't. I have not thought much about the page up /down/etc positions of keys so they are not getting in my way.I'm not sure why I'm reluctant to give it a "perfect" 5.  Perhaps someday I'll come back and change it.Update#2 Sept 20________________I've decided to give the keyboard another chance. I've ordered a replacement from Amazon to see if I can get one with a working spacebar perhaps the other problems will go away? It's just unusable with the spacebar functioning so poorly.UPDATE #1 Sept 14___________________... 10 days....(captain's log?:) ) ... still no love from the left space bar. THere are things I like about this keyboard.Believe it or not Ilike the numeric keypad being separate. It's like a fancy calculator. I like the ergo shape of the keyboard and the feel of the built in wrist wrest.I haven't gotten used to the FN switch. In fact I tried muting the speaker and kept hitting the F2 key and never realized that it wasn't working because I had to change the FN switch.The space bar is a big problem for me but in addition I feel that my typing has slowed down dramatically which is very bad.The position of the directional keys is also slowing me down still.So now I am contemplating two options. An offer from a friend who upgraded from a fairly new MS Natural 7000 to the sculpt and *loves* the sculpt (I'm a bit envious...I really wanted this to work for me) has offered to send me the 7000. My other option is to set aside my desire to have an ergonomic keyboard and opt for a mechanical keyboard (either das keyboard ..favored by many programmers I know or the new CODE Keyboard).However I think I will stick with ergonomic. Maybe I should look at logitech. I wish I lived somewhere that it was easy to try these out first hand.I will update again when I've made my decision.To be fair I've talked with a number of friends who are also programmers who got this keyboard and absolutely love it. They are not having the issues that I'm having. While i think the spacebar is a defect of this keyboard but the overall slowness for me is just too much and while a working spacebar will be a big improvement I don't think that will be enough.ORIGINAL POSTING_____________________I'll start with the good:it's very cool looking and I love having it on my desk. It makes this geek feel sooooo stylish!I've come from many many years of using the *original* Microsoft Ergonomic Natural Keyboard (precursor to the 4000 which is precursor to the 7000). I loved this keyboard. But after a recent lightning strike that came so close to home it has acted as though it were possessed by the devil. I ordered a 7000 to replace and one day later saw the announcements of this one so was able to cancel the not-yet-shipped 7000 and pre-order this site unseen and with extremely limited press reviews.I am not someone to glom on to new technology. The only other time I did that was after being stuck for 4 hours in Logan airport being brainwashed by the ad for the brand new IPodNano playing over and over again. I bought one within a week! Otherwisewelllet's just say I held on to my Blackberry for a long long time.But I wanted this one.I anticipated a learning curve as I got used to it. I'm still making a lot more typos than normal and it's annoying. I feel that it's slowing me down. BUt I also am confident that I'm still in learning curve mode.The one thing that is really bothersome is that the right spacebar sometimes ignores me. I have to pound on it. For some reason I use my right thumb 100% of the time to hit the spacebar. I don't think I should have to retrain myself because of possibly faulty equipment. Oddly I have read a similar complaint about the 7000 and was really surprised to find this happening in a much newer  model.I'm a little concerned about the bizarre Function key switch. But I've hardly had to use it yet. Same goes for the fact that the FN keys and escape are so small. But none of it has caused me any grief thus far.As a software developer I must confess that I am not a big key/combo user. I know a lot of developers prefer mechanical keyboards and drool over features like being able to map 18 key chords (okay I exaggerate that would take fingers & toes)while they are working. This is far from a mechanical keyboard. The keys are shallow. In fact they are even shallower than the keys on my Thinkpad. I don't know if this is why I have so many typos (in addition to the space bar problem). My instinct is that i really would rather have ergonomic than mechanical. Now ergo mechanical and backlit...there's the ticket! Oh yes I can't believe I acquiesced to yet another *black* keyboard that is not back-lit.The mouse was a bit of a shock at first. I had the Wireless Intellimouse Explorer 2.0 prior to this. I liked it a lot. While that is flatter and longer than the ergo mouse I think that they provide the same feel to my hand and I'm guessing that the overall length is the same once you account for the difference in arc. With the ones your fingers hang/curl more dramatically but it's just as comfy..maybe even more. Time will tell.I had already been using a mousepad with an elevated wrist wrest for years. I think it aligns even better with the new mouse than it did with the other.I also like that the mouse has a battery switch though I have to remember to use it. Oddly my intellimouse raced through batteries while I never changed the keyboard battery for its entire lifetime.So for now (about 5-6 days in with 3 being a holiday weekend where I did not do a lot of typing :) ) I'm a little frustrated with the keyboard and happy with the mouse. I will see if the space bar works itself out. If not I will try to see if Microsoft says it's just faulty and I should exchange it. The jury is still out on the FN key setup. I'd rather give this a 3.5 but I think a 4 would be misleading. I promise to update this review when I've spent more time with these devices.
5,This is my second MS Sculpt Ergonomic keyboard. My first one (5+ yrs) started having issues with typing when connected to newer work and home computer with USB-C ports. I thought it might have been related to USB-A to USB-C or USB3 issues. On top of that I am using a dual monitor KVM that is USB2. As a result of my quirky issues I started shopping for KVM's and ergonomic keyboards.Some other great options for ergonomic keyboards exist but they are generally full size with the number keypad you rarely use at least in my case anyway. Any mini keyboard without number keypad are standard non ergonomic keyboards. So.. before getting a costly KVM lettering was starting to come off the keys on my old keyboard anyway I purchased another Sculpt keyboard and .. I AM GLAD I DID. Solved all my problems with the ergonomic keyboard I love.My only comment I wish it had backlighting. But not a big deal for me would run down the battery faster anyway.I recommend without using a full keyboard with your mouse to the right of that or in some distant location this keyboard with a separate number keypad keeps your hands straight in front of you.
4,This is a great wireless keyboard with one potentially major flaw.I have had this keyboard for over 2 years. I am a storyteller and writer and am working on becoming an author so I type a great deal. Because of this I moved to this ergonomic keyboard/mouse combo. It is very comfortable.The mouse is softish rubber on the side to the touch but is a hard rubbery material. It it hard plastic on top and where the mouse buttons are. I have long fingers but not thick (my elderly father has quite thick hands from being in construction all his life) and it is comfortable to use for me and my dad wouldn't have any problems either with the comfortable spacing of the mouse. It takes AA batteries which are placed under the magnetic base of the mouse. I use the mouse a lot on a normal day (keyboard too) and for me the batteries don't last SUPER long but relatively long for a normal person's use. I personally bought a set of rechargeable batteries from Costco for the set and just rotate batteries charging them as needed. I've used the mouse on a gaming mouse pad (I'm an enthusiast gamer in my spare time) (though this mouse doesn't replace my gaming dedicated mouse) pillows sheets t-shirts towels etc. moving between my home office just laying in bed using my bedroom pc/hdtv. The mouse seems to respond quite well on all of them. Again I wouldn't use it for serious first person shooters when your team needs you to be right on target immediately but for normal use it's awesome. (The dongle is also under the mouse)I don't use the number pad often but when I have it's quick and can keep up with me fine. (I typed words until I had a hand injury at work at 150 wpm and data entry at over 9500 keystrokes per hour) Now it is too thin to take regular batteries and I haven't used it enough to run out of juice so I don't know how it'd do for someone who needs alot of data entry on that numpad.The keyboard is comfortable but coming from a regular straight keyboard took a little getting used to. Once I did however I was able to type a little faster maybe 5 to 10 percent (which when you are working on multiple 100000 word books is a big deal). Like the other items it responds well. The batteries don't last as long as the mouse but they are AAA's so that's part of it (yes you need AA batteries for the mouse but AAA for the keyboard hence the combo pack I bought at Costco). Now I don't know if that's because of typing so much or because if something is left on the keyboard and depresses a key (the keys don't take much to depress which is good for ergonomics and fast typing) the keyboard keeps draining even if the PC is off the keyboard power can drain (mouse too if you for some reason are moving the mouse alot when your computer is off). So I had to learn not to dump stuff on top of it when I was being lazy. But keep this in mind.The biggest problem with this set is that there is a single dongle that plugs into your computer and if this is damaged your out of luck. Not a problem you might think (as I did) that's not a problem I'll simply put the dongle in one of the usb ports in the back of the computer. NOPE! I tried that in every port I had and it majorly messes up the ability of the set to work the keyboard acts like it's drunk when you try to type the mouse is all jittery. Not good. So you have to put it in a front port and it sticks out a bit. Where I have to put my PC (I have a massive full tower HAF 932 Case for my gaming components) It sticks out where my body/legs go. So as much as I've tried to remember to be careful near it I inevitably forget because I'm a spaz sometimes (lol) and bump it. Over 2 years it's now dead as a door nail. It sticks out a bit more than most dongles so I never got used to it. With logitech sets (which I don't believe are as good and I have tried a few) you can get a replacement dongle. But with this microsoft set they won't give you one. They claim they can't which may be true but I doubt it. But you can't get a new dongle you have to buy a whole new set. That's a MAJOR flaw for some people. If you are more careful than I am you might be completely fine.I personally just ordered a second set. I now have a wrist injury and am recovering from surgery so the comfort and ergonomics of this set are very important to me along with the speed it gives me compared to my plug in regular flat keyboard. As an aspiring author I need the best and this is it. (It's also quiet to type on which most people won't care about but for me I have multiple books spinning in my head and so many angles and options that any distraction could make me forget something before I get it out on "paper")I wholeheartedly recommend this set. However because of the dongle flaw and the cost for buying a new set because of it I just can't give it 5 stars. It is the best set I've ever used though and if your careful or need the best GET IT NOW
4,I purchased this keyboard since I have been experience pains in my arms since I work all day long on a computer. I already had a Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 with my work computer however I wasn't happy with the spacebar on this keyboard. I also wanted a much better mouse since the standard mouse that I was using on my PC wasn't cutting it. I was getting pains in my wrists and that was pretty unpleasant. So when I heard about this new ergo keyboard that Microsoft announced I became very interested in it for multiple reasons.Installing the keyboard was a cinch unpacking the keyboard wasn't too hard. There were already batteries not only including in the box but already in the devices. The nice thing about how the batteries were included was that there is a small plastic strip that stuck out which prevents the batteries being used while in the box. You just pull that plastic strip out and now your devices have power. The keyboard and mouse has a really nifty cover that uses magnets to keep closed instead of your standard clip that you have to pry open. So you just lift the magnetically closed cover which opens gracefully and you have easy access to change batteries for the future. However the 10 digit keypad will require a small screwdriver to change that battery.The mouse hides the small usb adapter underneath the battery cover and can easily be taken out. I really like how they designed to keep the usb adapter in there very smart design. I just plugged in the USB adapter into my Windows 7 machine and it automatically installed and recognized my devices without any problems. I didn't need to install any drivers or have to do anything to "sync" the devices. The keyboard mouse and 10 digit keypad all worked without any work.I saw that the spacebar has a split design and was very excited about that since on the 4009 model MS keyboard I had before had an issue with sticking or just being difficult to press down. Now with the Sculpt keyboard it is like night and day difference it is super easy to press down the spacebar with either finger since it has a split design to there are actually two separate keys for spacebar one for each thumb.Speaking of the keys on the keyboard it has a much different feel. It has adopted the chiclet style keys which has gained a lot of popularity many laptops these days including something like Apple Macbook. The keys have a very low amount of travel meaning it is very light and easy to press. So much so that at first I had to get used to it because the keys were so shallow and easy to press. After about a week I got a lot more used to it. The buttons for the function keys that run along the top definitely run on the small side and pretty much has no travel like the normal alpha keys do I didn't care for that as much. I also wish that the menu/right click button to the right of the right Alt key on the keyboard could be reconfigured to be another Windows button. I often like to hit the "Windows + L" shortcut to easily lock my computer it would nice to not have to hit the Windows key on the left side.Another aspect of the keyboard that I was excited about was having the 10 digit keypad separate. Being a guy with a smaller frame I don't have super wide shoulders. So by having the 10 digit keypad be separate it allowed me to keep the mouse not so far to the right of the keyboard. Thus allowing me to have a much more natural position of not having my right arm at an angle to the right but more directly straight and in front of me. However when it came time to wanting to use the 10 digit keypad that can be a bit awkward to figure out how to use. I have tried using it above the mouse or to the right of the mouse but neither one felt natural but luckily I don't need to use that too often.I have been pleasantly surprised how much like using the wedge you can put underneath the keyboard to prop the front side of the keyboard up. I felt like it has put less strain on my arm and in more comfortable position to reach all the keys on the keyboard. I also really like how comfortable the pad is on the front of the keyboard.However the thing that I am the most disappointed with on the keyboard is the stability of it. At work my desk is not your standard straight desk edge but is curved and my computer monitors are in the middle of that curve. So putting that keyboard at the edge of the curve makes it tip in the middle. It affects how much I can pull the keyboard towards me while typing. Luckily with putting on the wedge under the keyboard helps out to make it more stable but can still be an issue sometimes.One of the main reasons I was most excited about this set was the mouse I am very pleased with the mouse. After adjusting my desk to the proper height I was able to get used to having my hand more tiled. But I really love it now and the pains that I used to have in my right wrist has gone away now and I am very pleased about that. The mouse does run on the large side of things but I think that is good design to help keep your hand in proper form. I really like the feel of the rubber on the device and the scroll wheel is very smooth to use. The buttons on the side next to the thumb has a very nice and soft click feel to them.Overall it is a fantastic keyboard and mouse set I would highly recommend it to individuals who want a better and more comfortable keyboard and mouse for their PC. I docked it one star because of the occasional stability/tippiness issues with my desk at work.
5,Set up was easy and fast. It took about a week to get used to typing but I was okay with that.  I type all day long for work and my wrists and upper shoulders were in daily pain from using the wrong keyboard. Go ergonomic if you can to help reduce the  pain.
2,*** I wrote a procedure on how to get it to work on Mac. Check the following post: http://www.themtparty.com/archives/6007I usually work on Mac and Linux. But still Microsoft provided a driver for different OS especially Mac. That's what I loved about Natural Ergonomic Desktop 7000. When I first bought 7000 didn't even know Mac compatibility wasn't on the list. But soon I found out Microsoft made it compatible with Mac as well. It has been wonderful 6 years typing on my 7000. I expected the same quality of service with Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop well failed.The keyboard is brilliant and gorgeous. If anyone uses num pad more frequently no need to go back to good-old wired keyboard with this. There aren't many wireless keyboard with numpad and if it is wireless it's not sculpted right. It's incredibly hard to use non-sculpted keyboard and type hours and hours a day. In my case I do need numpad so I believed this set of keyboard will redeem me out of miseries wrong. It didn't. This keyboard does not support mac and if you have read a magazine -like I did- explaining how this keyboard supports both PC and Mac don't believe them. It simply doesn't support Mac.Most of the keys on the keyboard still works fine. Little tweaking can fix Win key and Option(alt) key reversal. But rest of the keys don't even respond properly. f13 to f15 don't work. Obviously none of the function keys (volume controls brightness controls and etc.) will work. Some of the sources I've found said that it will or does support Mac. Again it doesn't support Mac as of now. I am hoping Microsoft will provide the drivers for Mac as well but we will see.Update 1 ------I realized on my previous review it was all about "how MS decided to drop support for Mac and Linux" which would have been useful only to certain groups of people like who had been a big fan of microsoft keyboard for a long time and studied other periperhals. I'm sorry it was just plainly wrong to think it that way.Driver is still not supported. I looked up some of the 3rd party drivers which was up to no avail. But unless you are looking for serious extra features in the keyboard or the mouse it should be just enough. Volume controls and play/stop on the keyboard still works on Mac and rest of the buttons are for Windows 8 specifically: don't expect it to work on Mac. None of the calculator buttons work either. If you are looking for brightness control you can change it under the system preferences under keyboard menu like option-control key reversal.The keyboard itself is just like any other MS keyboard. It rests wonderfully under your palm key clicks like mechanical but the sound it makes is a lot smoother and quieter compared to Desktop 7000. If you are one of those 'mechanical keyboard' fans you might find this as a more practical and cheaper alternative than heavy-duty mechanical keyboard. In my opinion many of the mechanical keyboard brands are overrated; in that sense MS nails it brilliantly every time. All of the battery compartments in all of the devices (except for numpad) are magnetic so don't worry about your nails when you open it. It's a small change but I love it so much. You don't have to link it to the receiver like in the year 2000s it just works out of the box.It's the Num Pad that wins the trophy. The conventional keyboard always have num pad connected to the main keyboard meaning big chuck plastic will be lying around on your desk. Not only it's ridiculous I fairly don't use numpad that often. Even while I'm working I've always wished my numpad could be placed elsewhere for convenience. It's hard to reach out to a mouse when the numpad is sitting there. But not any more! Your numpad is free. Place it anywhere you want take it out when you need it the most.However the mouse is a big disappointment. It's sculpted. Right it's sculpted but that can't be an excuse of having less and less features day by day. Except for 2 button and a wheel none of the extra buttons are in right place. You have to literally relocate your thumb to the button find it and press it. It's not a question of getting used to it. Unless MS really wants us not to use anymore than 2 buttons like Steve Jobs did with 1 button mouse this is total screw-up. Compared to my good-old Logitech Performance MX -For the record it probably costs 10 times more than this mouse so this is an unfair comparison- while the ergonomics of the mouse is superior then Logitech's rest of it is simply non-existent: no revolutionary "click wheels" less buttons locations of the buttons are also weird.As for the USB receiver MS has reduced its size. But not quite enough. Why would I want to store my receiver in my mouse? Why not in the keyboard? It would have been really nice to have a space in the keyboard to put it. Some of designs raise a lot of questions too. How come the keyboard uses 2 AAA batteries while the mouse uses 2 AAs? How come I can't change battery in Numpad without having a screw driver? Why not a small LED to tell us whether caps lock is on or not? What about for num lock?In total if it wasn't for the driver I would have given it 4 stars. It is still one of the best keyboard+mouse combo I've ever used in office. Driver support and poor PR costs another 2 stars. I hope MS starts notifying other blogs and magazines of "how they did not intend to support Mac to begin with."Update 2 ------I found out some relief for mac users if you were a big fan of Ergonomic Desktop (previous model of ergonomic lines). The only difference you will see will be set of missing keys: web search mail calculator (not function due to missing driver) back forward and zoom; which none of them I used on Ergonomic Desktop to begin with. Volume keys and play/pause key work just fine and that were the only key I needed with my old keyboard. Only key I will probably miss would be calculator key which is still on but does not work. For the record of who wonders how about brightness F14 and F15 are mapped to control brightness (OS X default) and you may remap F13 or any other function keys (F1~F15) to associate with your choice of feature with 3rd party drivers like "BetterTouchTools." F13=PrtScn F14=ScrLk F15=Pause. If you need any of the keys that were on older keyboard or supposedly work on current model until MS launches Mac driver 3rd party apps could be some relief. Personally I don't see when or why would MS even develop a Mac driver for this particular model; it's filled with Windows specified keys. Mouse on the other hand is still up to no avail yet.Update 3 ------Num pad does not use neither AA nor AAA batteries. It uses one of the coin-type battery and I have never seen the size of the battery they decided to put in the num pad. I suppose it will last longer than any other coin battery I've seen or used but it bother me that it's not a common type.Update 4 4/23/15 ––I saw my reviews being quotes as "how to use MS keyboard on Mac" and I'd like to summarize what you'd need. Get Karabiner to set Application Key to Option key. As for the Alt and Ctrl you can reverse them in the System Preferences under keyboard Modifier Keys. If your f13 f14 f15 (Print Screen Screen Lock Pause) keys do not work as it should be (usually brightness control) get Better Touch Tool. Set f14 and f15 for brightness down/up respectively.The unit I purchased on 2013 is now broken down entirely. I think it has to do with the plastics they were literally tearing apart. I try to fix them glue them together if possible. At this point I purchased a business version (so it's my second Sculpt Keyboard) which does not include a mice but only wireless keyboard and a wireless keypad. If you are looking only into the keyboard I think that will be a great option as well.Update 5 6/10/15 ------I wrote a procedure on how to get it to work on Mac. Check the following post: http://www.themtparty.com/archives/6007
5,I have never felt so much attracted to an object as I feel with this keyboard. I’m tingly in places that makes me feel weirdly turned on. But honestly? If this keyboard was a person Baby I’d get those digits….. using the Bluetooth 10-key pad that’s included of course! ;) I will say the keyboard is like that one hot mom you met last week on a blind date set up by your nosey friend while the mouse is their weird anti-social son that secretly likes to rip wings off butterflies in the backyard for fun. It’s awkward and frumpy and such a turn off. Does NOT go with my keyboard boyfriend. :( Now I have a weird craving to listen to 80’s Madonna while daydreaming about my keyboard lover.
4,The Sculpt keyboard is a good iteration on Microsoft's long line of split-and-curved style of ergonomic keyboards. I have been using "Naturals" keyboards since the late 90s and this one feels great to type on. Overall the experience with the keyboard and mouse has been very positive. After only about a week of use I am pretty much hooked. Barring early-failure incident I expect I would buy another and/or recommend to friends and family. It loses 1 star for a poor rf-connection that requires a short unobstructed path from dongle to device. Extended review below.Pros: * Keyboard and mouse both have a nice sturdy heft/feel. The keyboard in particular with its literally-split design might appear like it would flex in the middle when you rest your hands on the padded bar at the bottom or if you press the keys firmly. It doesn't. Surprisingly robust. * The keyboard is really pleasant to type on. The key-travel is just about perfect and the roll + yaw of the split keyboard makes for extremely happy wrists even if used for hours on end. The wrist-rest at the base of the keyboard provides a perfect (for me) amount of padding. * My initial impression of the mouse was that it was unnecessarily bulky but after a few days of use I used a desktop pc with a conventional mouse and found myself longing for the Sculpt mouse. * One problem I've always had with this style is that their over-sized space bars had a tendency to degrade over time causing a sticky or overly-firm actuation but this generation cut the space bar into 2 separate buttons mitigating this problem. * The keyboard riser and the battery-covers for keyboard and mouse attach magnetically. While this means they might fall off accidentally I think this is a pro. I had a MS Naturals keyboard that fell to the floor once and the plastic-tab-attached riser bar partially broke off making it unusable. In this version it would just pop off and be easily re-attachable. I suppose if you carried these devices around with you often the battery cover could possibly come off accidentally and get lost. But I like the magnetic rather than plastic-friction attachment apparatus.Cons: * My biggest problem with this keyboard is how close I have to keep the rf-usb dongle to the keyboard and mouse to not drop keystrokes/movements. You can forget about connecting it behind a desktop tower or into a usb-hub on the back of a monitor -- that doesn't work. The only way I've been able to maintain a reliable connection is to attach the dongle into a use hub/extension so that the dongle can lay within a few unobstructed inches of the keyboard/mouse. I once set a plastic water bottle (full of water) between the dongle and the keyboard and noticed a near 100% connectivity loss -- maybe 1 in 15 key presses made it to the computer and the mouse movement was jerky and sporadic. * The devices and their dongle are an unalterably-linked cryptographic pair. There is NO WAY to use any Sculpt device without the usb dongle that it came with. If your mouse or keyboard breaks you cannot simply get a new one and use it with the original pair's dongle. If you lose or break your dongle it CANNOT be replaced. You'll have to buy a whole new set. * The delete/home/insert/etc buttons are crammed together in an atypical layout. I've only been actively using this keyboard for about a week of extensive daily use but I still have to look do to find home and end (keys I hit very frequently when writing software) and frequently hit 'delete' when or backspace when I meant to hit something else. * The Escape and F-keys are very small. This is true on many newer laptop keyboards as well but I would much prefer them to be larger. When editing a text file in VI I find myself hitting ` instead of (or in addition to) escape with annoying frequency. This might not be the best keyboard for someone who spends a lot of time using VI.
4,I'm writing this review on the keyboard as we speak which means that generally speaking I can use it without worrying overmuch about the feel of the keyboard. However the mouse that came with the package could be best described as "a giant hunk of plastic) that periodically falls off the desk onto the concrete floor. Which means that the first star was taken off purely because of the inclusion of a mouse that I never use.Realistically I bought the keyboard because I got tired of using a wired keyboard and dealing with the USB cords to the machine. I work on a desk that's approximately 48" x 27" and is a standing/sitting desk configured to be comfortable for me to stand or sit and type but without an adjustable desk top. However it houses two 27" monitors one 24" monitor a laptop two external hard drives my mobile phone mount a mouse pad two mice (laptop / desktop) a speaker set the occasional curious cat demanding attention charging station for Bluetooth headset etc. etc.I've also been switching over our house usage from throwaway to rechargable batteries with a series of charged-up batteries in waiting plus a charging station for said batteries so no worries on that count either.Moving a wired keyboard around from standing to sitting positions got to be a pain in the butt so I picked up the combo pack. Makes sense right? I thought "Hey I should get this so I could use the mouse with my laptop or if ever I decided to go all portable I could just toss the ergos in my backpack and go."That said I keep finding myself slightly frustrated when I type on the keyboard. My muscle memory was trained for the past ten years to a wired ergonomic keyboard. I should not expect that the new sleek sexy keyboard has the same physical profile as the old keyboard (it sits much lower and flatter to the profile of the desk and does not have flippable stand tabs as the Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 - the wired version - does). In addition the extra keys at the top are gone and the zoom in/out and back/forward buttons are gone so I find myself making hand gestures that don't work. In time I'm sure I'll adapt to the new workflow but the differences are there.In addition the DELETE key is in a slightly different space than on the wired version making it possible for me to slip a finger over and go "wait why are you scrolling to the bottom...oh. I hit END not DELETE" at least twice a day. The simple fact is that the DELETE key wouldn't logically go anywhere else in a keyboard layout but the muscle memory shift is slightly confusing.In short you won't be able to instantaneously shift from a Microsoft Ergonomic Desktop 4000 keyboard to this one without making some mistakes and having to adapt your typing stance somewhat. I have in the past month or so learned enough to be comfortable touch-typing with the keyboard but my typos spelling mistakes and other "issues" do seem to crop up more often than if I use the old wired keyboard.It is however a viable and comfortable alternative to a wireless keyboard if you are using it with a laptop. I also like the fact that the keypad is separate from the main board making it easy for me to stash it elsewhere when I'm not using it.I also know that it's ridiculous to expect the full feature list of the Microsoft Ergonomic 4000 to the Sculpt but I do find myself groping for the music pause buttons periodically or the quick buttons I had set to run programs and email.However as a keyboard to go along with your laptop I'd highly recommend it - it's similar enough to most external keyboards to be comfortable to use but also has the small lightweight and portable factor.But that mouse...somehow I expected something small sexy and light like the Microsoft Wedge Mouse and instead got the hulking oversized awkward cousin in the package. But for the time being it works fine in its current role - sitting around as a replacement in the event my beloved Razer 12-button mouse ever craps itself and I need to pick up a replacement. That thing is huge and the only advantage I see with it is that it natively works with a single plug-in to a USB port.All in all it's a nice keyboard with a few missing tweaks. Rather than drop to a 3 star review I'll hold at 4 even though the issues with the format and the mouse take it down 1.25 stars. If I was judging the package solely on the keyboard and not the added mouse it would run a 4.5 star review but the inclusion of the mouse brings it down just a notch.
4,Edit: when I received my replacement sculpt desktop I realized there was a place to dock the dongle.  The dongle can be nested inside the mouse.  New units are packaged with the dongle nested in the mouse. The first keyboard I received evidently had been returned because the dongle was with the manuals.  I would also encourage Microsoft to place something in the packaging stating where the dongle is stored because I started to think the dongle wasn’t included.  In that panic i tried using the mouse on the desktop my wife uses and the dongles are specific to the mouse keypad and keyboard keyboard they ship with.  I also failed to mention that unlike any mouse I have ever seen there is a magnetic closure on the bottom cover.  With the dongle stored there the magnetic closure means there is no worry about breaking off a plastic tab by repeatedly removing and replacing the cover.  I would still buy a second desktop or keep the one you are replacing handy if you travel a lot.  In light of so many unique great features I am surprised that Microsoft settled for the dongle being unique to the keyboard keypad and mouse it is shipped with.I love the mouse I love the keyboard and I can’t live without the numeric keypad. I don’t love the dongle.  First unlike Logitech the dongle is unique to the keyboard and mouse.  Lose the dongle buy a new keyboard/mouse...pack notebook computer in brief case with dongle attached/dongle breaks.  Believe it or not the dongle pictured above quit working (if you notice it is barely bent to the left).  So now I am buying a new Microsoft keyboard.  If I hadn’t already gone through a stack of Logitech keyboards either because all the letters wearing off the keys or broken keyboard supports I would go back to them.  I love their dongles though.  Being able to pair any peripheral with any computer is completely user friendly.Here is the other trick when you start removing the dongle to put in a briefcase - there is no place to dock the dongle in the keyboard so you have to keep up with it and while that should be a big deal it still leaves a possibility of it getting damaged or lost.  Why the dongle cannot flush out with the notebook computer like others I don’t know.While I never drove a Jaguar the joke in the 80’s was you needed to have two because one was always in the shop.  If you buy one of these sets I recommend buying a second - if you travel a lot.  The one on my desktop has been flawless and best of all I have worn no key markings off the keyboard in over a year of working on it.
5,I’m a software developer. I have had this keyboard and mouse since July 2014. And I’ve had numerous jobs that provided keyboard and mouse including at a company that gave me a Logitech Ergo + MX vertical mouse combo that costs over $220 which I gave a month to get used to; their philosophy is the longer you can keep a developer’s hands on the keyboard the better. And after a month I still brought this Sculpt combo in from home. Let me tell you why.This keyboard is very comfortable to type on; I cannot type on non-wavy or split keyboard anymore without feeling discomfort very quickly after getting used to this keyboard. I have some badass and expensive mechanical keyboard that I hardly use due to this which I only use for gaming now. The Logitech that my company got me is good to type on too but just the keyboard or the mouse individually cost more than this Sculpt combo.This Sculpt mouse also fit my hand like near perfectly. Its high curve makes it actually fit in my hand naturally. Unlike my gaming mouse my hand have to be more flatten and more of the bottom of palm has to rub on the table. This mouse’s high curves reduces the surface area to table ratio. While I like the MX vertical mouse’s scroll wheel I don’t like how much of my hand’s surface area have to be rubbing on the table from my pinky to my wrist. Like this is where there Sculpt mouse truly shines for me. It just frigging fits!I wish everyone could have find that mouse that fits your hand near perfectly like I have. It’s tough to go with any other mouse for productivity.Now let me talk about the negatives. The rubber on my mouse is completely disgusting looking. The wrist fabric on the keyboard is very worn. But I’m the only one touching it so as long as I’m comfortable on it I don’t care about what anyone else says. I definitely wish the materials would be better and I hope  that Microsoft come up with a new version of this. But considering that I’ve used this for 6 years for 5 days a week it definitely held up. That said I believe that this mouse is on its last legs. The battery life on the mouse is shorter. The same batteries mAh used to allow this mouse to run for 6-8 months now can only run it 3. Not to mention that I sometimes need to knock the mouse a few times for it to even get power. So I’m thinking some internal wiring is loose causing inefficient battery drain or no power. I guess after 6 years it’s probably time. I’m hoping that it’ll last another year for Microsoft or somebody else to come up with a similarly shaped mouse but with better material. The keyboard is still fine just that the wrist rest fabric is worn and I have to stuff the fabric back in the corner every now and then. Battery life seems fine on that.(Update: I have officially put this mouse out of its misery. RIP July 2014-November 2020)
5,Update: BEST KEYBOARD EVER!!! I have been using this keyboard for a while now and it has helped my should problems SO MUCH. In fact they are gone! I had completely forgotten how much my shoulder bothered me on other keyboards until I had to use my husband's one day. It's ergonomic but the numeric keypad is attached which makes using the mouse a literal pain in the neck. Using this one with the numeric keypad separate has completely taken care of the problem! YIPPEEEEEE! And using the mouse has not bothered me at all despite it looking less ergonomic than my old one. The keyboard still looks brand new and so does the mouse. I love that the mouse has a spot to put the USB for it so I don't lose it. The bottom of my mouse stays on no problem--you just have to put it on correctly. This is the best keyboard set EVER and I'm SO HAPPY I have it!!!!! I'm now going to get another one for my husband for when I have to use his computer too. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!I replaced my (very) old Microsoft Natural wireless keyboard with this version. When I received it I unboxed it plugged the single USB in and keyboard mouse and numeric pad all just plain worked. No setup at all! This could be common as keyboards go now but I haven't had a new one in so long I was expecting to have to install drivers etc. Nope! Just plug and play--yay! It has a slightly different typing feel than my old one but has the same (or very similar) slope as the MS Natural if you use the elevating piece and I got used to typing on it in a matter of minutes. I'm sure the muscle-memory learning curve would be longer if you're not coming from a similarly shaped keyboard though. I find this new one very comfortable--even more so than my old one. And the BEST thing about it is that the numeric keypad is separate so that I can have my mouse in a much more ergonomic position--closer to my hand instead of an extra 3-4 inches off to the right as on my old keyboard with built-in numeric pad. This was the only keyboard I found like that so I'm thrilled it is comfortable in general as well as with the mouse. The keys are nice and quiet too. My home office is right next to my toddler's room and my old keyboard was loud enough to disturb him but this one is plenty quiet.Also I like the mouse. I wasn't sure if it was going to be ergonomic enough but I actually think it's just right. The vertical mice crank my wrist too much. This one is in a very natural position and with my gel mouse pad with the wrist rest it feels like the perfect position. The mouse is taking a little longer to get used to. It is a little heavier than my old one and it lacks an indent on the right side of it which makes it more difficult to grip when you have to pick up the mouse to move it from one corner of the screen to another. This is a moderate nuisance to me since I work on a really big screen hence the four stars but since it feels so comfortable otherwise I think it will end up working pretty well. I might try to put a little poster putty or maybe even a little smear of silicone caulk on the side to add grip. I would not consider this a deal breaker but if you do the keyboard is available to buy without the mouse if you want to use a different mouse with it.
4,I've bought multiple of these keyboard sets because they offer exactly what they promise at a very reasonable cost compared to other ergonomic keyboards and mice sets. Every single time one broke I got a replacement - that's how much I liked them. Trouble is of course that these things break a little easily.The first one broke when I lost the USB dongle it uses to communicate with the computer - turns out every single one has a unique encryption key to prevent hacking which is nice but means you can't use the keyboard or mouse without its specific dongle. The second one failed mysteriously - I couldn't see anything wrong with it - but luckily Microsoft offers a 3 year warranty on all its keyboards so I got it refunded. (note to buyers: don't buy the extra warranty Amazon offers unless you're sure the Microsoft 3 year warranty isn't enough for you). The third I bought used and immediately regretted it when I opened up the box and realized the USB dongle was nowhere to be found. Luckily Amazon's generous returns policy means I could get it returned and refunded in an instant without hassle despite the fact that the thing I was returning was worthless. (note to buyers: if you're buying this used make sure you get the dongle specific to the keyboard and mouse you're buying). I think there were a fourth and a fifth mixed in there somewhere between the first and second but they're not really worth mentioning because I think I returned them when I realized I didn't need them and also because I forgot the details.Point is I'm on my... sixth? Sculpt keyboard set because these things work but I'm on my sixth because these things are fragile in ways you might not expect. You don't have to worry about that too much because of Amazon's generous returns policy (seriously I've returned like 3 of these things without issue) and Microsoft's long-lived manufacturer's warranty but it is something you have to worry about a bit. Make sure you safeguard that USB dongle like it's worth ~$100 (because it is) don't drop your mouse too often and you should be fine. I still like these things for what that's worth: good battery life ergonomics you'll miss when you return to other keyboards and mice and a definite eye catcher and conversation starter - those are things that keep me coming back.Oh and one last piece of advice: In my experience with buying a lot of these things I've noticed that the price actually fluctuates a lot. I've seen it sold (new by Amazon) for as low as ~$70 and as high as ~$110. If you don't need this urgently consider waiting for the price to drop.
5,If you are at all like me then you research products when you buy them.  I am one of those people who doesn't normally write reviews but I feel as if it is necessary to write a review on this keyboard/mouse combo.When reading the reviews before I made my purchase I was a little weary of the "F" keys--simply because the work I do requires a lot of use of all the "F" keys.  They are a completely different feel from the regular keys but they work well--and they are not at all annoying.  The other "complaint" I read about was the lack of a "Fn" key--instead you have the little slide at the top of the keyboard.  Mine always stays on the "white" keys and it is a non-issue for me.  Another complaint that I read about was the inability to find the /? key not sure what that was about.  If you know how to type on a regular keyboard then finding the /? key is the exact same.  The 6 key layout is a bit different for your "Home End Page Up Page Down and Delete" keys but again it is not a big adjustment.Now for the positives:I bought this keyboard because my wrists were aching when I would come home from work (primarily my right wrist) and there was nothing I could do to get rid of the pain.  My job requires me to sit in front of a computer all day and type emails enter orders etc.  I began thinking about an "ergonomic" keyboard and decided that I would go to Staples to look for a keyboard.  I tried "typing" on the Sculpt keyboard and it felt AWESOME!!!  The price however was not awesome so I decided to try my luck on Amazon.com and found an awesome deal on this keyboard set.  I decided to give it a whirl and I sure am glad I did.  I guess I've had the keyboard for about 3 weeks now and I can honestly say that my wrists no longer hurt.  The position that your hands are in feels completely natural and not at all "forced."  I haven't been typing for very long (approx. 7-8 years) but the switch over to an "ergonomic" style keyboard has made a huge impact on speed and comfort.  I can type approximately 60-70 wpm without any pain.The number pad is very handy to be able to move around however I typically leave it in the position of a normal number pad.  It's nice because it has a calculator button on it so you can readily access that (the regular keyboard has a calculator button on it as well).The mouse is very comfortable but if you have small hands it could be a problem.  Also if you like to use the left hand for the mouse this is a no go.  It does have a windows button and a back button on it but I never use them--simply because I forget that they are even there.  I guess they are convenient if you remember you have them but it's not something I rely on daily.I guess this is kind of an after thought but some people were complaining about the "6" key and it's location.  I don't type with the numbers on the keyboard--I use the number pad so this is a moot point.  However for those of you wondering Microsoft did put it on the "left" side of they split and according to the way I was taught that is the correct location for it.All in all this product is a great product and I would buy it again and again--no doubt.  I'm glad I did this review but I apologize to those of you reading it because I type how I think--very choppy.
4,The only reason I’m not giving this five stars is because of how slick they are on the bottom. There’s no way of making them stay in one place.
4,The Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop includes a scissor-switch split design keyboard a separate number pad and a wireless full-featured ergonomic mouse. The entire desktop is wireless and uses a small USB dongle that is could fit squarely within a half-dollar coin.They keyboard itself has a contemporary design with a comfortable wrist pad. The layout is pretty standard with the Home/Page key bank set vertically instead of the traditional horizontal layout. The F-Keys are not scissor switch keys rather they have a light "click switch" feel to them. Additionally they have alternate functionality which is controlled by a small slide-switch in the top right-hand corner of the keyboard above the home key.The number pad is entirely standard with key similar to the F-Keys on the keyboard for the numlock calculator and backspace. The rest of the number pad is standard scissor switches.The mouse is an ergonomic design which means you are meant to approach it by placing the side of your hand against the desk and letting it fall around the mouse. The mouse has a standard clickable scroll wheel and a "back" button on the thumb switch. Additionally there is a "Windows" key on the mouse that brings up the start menu or takes you to the Metro screen on Win8.They keys on the keyboard are very light to the touch but still have a very "reassuring" tactile response to them. The stroke length is minimal making it easy for touch-typists to increase their WPM once they are used to the ergonomic layout. Personally the feel of the keys is one of the best features on this keyboard from an ergonomic standpoint.The wrist pad is comfortable but seems a little prone to staining and discoloring. It's best not to put lotion on your hands immediately before using the keyboard if you don't like to see imprints of your wrists on the pad.The F-Keys leave a bit to be desired. They are reasonably sensitive but the design is prone to sticking. It's not to the point of un-usability it happens pretty rarely but enough to mention.Additionally the lack of extended features on the keyboard or the tying of such features to the F-Keys is somewhat of a disappointment. Coming from the Natural 4000 which had full media controls and favorites readily available this keyboard is missing a quite a bit of that sort of thing. It's easy to work around but these were value-added features in the other keyboards that would have been worthwhile to include somehow. There are still some media controls available with the alternative F-Keys (play/pause and volume controls) but there are a few missing (next/previous track for example).The number pad is nice but it does take some getting used to having it not directly connected to the keyboard. The keys are the same as what is on the keyboard. Having the numlock off they keyboard and as a different type of key has completely eliminated accidental numlock instances that used to drive me up a wall on the Natural 4k.The mouse is entirely comfortable and accurate. The Windows button is very helpful for Win8 users and even in previous versions is nice. The battery compartment is sealed with a magnetic cover that is easy to remove but somewhat confusing to replace due to the fact that the information about the mouse is on the INSIDE of the cover instead of the usual outside.There is a place in the mouse to store the tiny USB dongle so it doesn't get lost in a box.Overall I'm pretty impressed with this keyboard. Typing on it is a joy I've become a faster and more accurate typist in the short month that I've been using it. I miss some of the extended features from the classic Natural Ergonomic 4000 keyboard but all told it was a worthwhile upgrade that I would fully recommend to anyone either already using an MS ergonomic keyboard or to anyone interested in doing so.
4,The title of my review is strange and that kind of reflects my feeling so far about the keyboard.I've been a long time user of the Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard. They never lasted very long for me but I am a power typer and tend to wear out keyboards. I go through them quickly and learned that the Ergonomic Keyboard actually did alleviate any awkward feelings I have in the back of my shoulders or arms/wrists from being at a keyboard all day.This keyboard is definitely high quality. When you take it out of the box you might even think it's made out of steel or stone. It is not heavy but it is extremely sturdy compared to past models.  The keys have gone from the full push down style to the chicklet style of keyboard that you might expect from a laptop. I wouldn't call them as high of quality that I would bestow upon the best of the IBM Thinkpad laptop keyboards but it's close. Response time is extremely fast and the keys will type as fast as you're capable.Pairing was easy though I didn't realize that the transponder was in the mouse. I'm not using that silly mouse and I never did like that design but it came with the kit. Windows 7 automatically downloaded the proper software and there was no "flying blind" trying to get the wireless keyboard to pair. The wireless functionality has been seamless and I haven't skipped a bit. No duplicate letters or ssssstuttttering typing like you can get from some wireless keyboards.Now for the tough love part. With the more compact size I am definitely saving desk space but I am not sure that I am getting the same full ergonomic benefit that I got from the old style. I feel like I'm clasping my arms together in front of me to reach the keyboard and that leaves some muscle fatigue in the front of my bicep areas. This keyboard is significantly smaller/less wide than the regular ergonomic keyboard. I will continue to use the keyboard for a while and see if this is simply a need for adjustment and eventually I'll get used to it.Second part of tough love: I would really appreciate some kind of magnetic feature between the add on number pad and the keyboard or some kind of slot that I could attach it to to keep it in place. As I move my keyboard forward and back as I move my seat up and back up and down throughout the day to vary my sitting position I find that now do I not only have a mouse and keyboard to move but a third independent object that requires attention. I always find it in the wrong spot on the desk.  Another topic that I will watch over and see how it goes after I've had more time to adjust.One final piece of happy candy about this keyboard: a slide-able select button that allows you to choose between F keys (F1 F5 etc.) and Microsoft function keys ( Open close settings sound etc.) The old keyboard would default back to Microsoft function keys every now and again and I won't have to worry about that with this model.All said and done I like it enough that I'm going to keep on with it albeit a few things that I'm a little unsure about.  The old keyboard was done and I had to move on either way. If I have significant changes I will update my review in the future.
5,I own 3 computers.  Each of them has a MICROSOFT ERGONOMIC keyboard for a reason.  I bought my first on advice from my brother.  How they fit the posture of your arms / hands while typing reduces considerable stress on those areas.  The palm rest only enhances your comfort while typing / computing.  I have used all the keyboards over the 20 years I have been computing and have never been unhappy with them.  They ARE however not for everyone.  Some people prefer a narrow straight keyboard that comes standard with most computers. If you are a laptop user you may consider this an a serious upgrade from the standard laptop in the sense that it types like a laptop keyboard ... again reducing the unnatural ergonomics of keeping your elbows against your sides while maneuvering keystrokes with your hands.  It is just a NATURAL feel for the comfort of your "body-nomics".  If space is a consideration and you want an ergonomic keyboard I highly recommend this one.  It is the smallest of the 3 that I use.  Light weight and comes with a "booster" that raises the keyboard from the bottom of the board.  It is magnetic and just clings to the bottom of the board and with a light pull comes loose for storage.THAT being said I find that (bottom magnetic support) a but cumbersome for my needs.  I like keyboards with the two snap-out extensions beneath the board to elevate the FRONT of the board.  This keyboard does not have those 2 snap-out additions.  For mine to be used as I do I have made a small elevation piece made from spare wood and rubber parts that sits beneath my keyboard to elevate the front.The separate number key pad is something to get used to but if you rarely use it it is NOT part of the keyboard itself.  Easily stowed in a non function place (drawer / desk space not used etc.)Mouse: larger than I like but TOTALLY programmable through Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center (which comes with Windows 8.1) or can be downloaded separately from Microsoft for free.  Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center knows EVERY Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard ever made and can be used to set those up to your personal standards. I use three different systems: Win 8.1 Pro / Win 7 SP1 / Win XP.  The Mouse Center can be loaded on all 3 operating systems and works with any mouse / keyboard (PS/2 or the newer type of dongles (independent TX/RX)Having stated the above I queried Microsoft Sales about having a dongle that is like Logitech Unifying dongles.  Those control up to six (6) separate mice / keyboards out of 1 USB port on ANY computer in range with Logitech keyboards and mice.  Not sure whether they use WiFi or bluetooth but they WORK.  Microsoft advised me that each of their devices always come with their own dongles.  SAD.  How many USB ports could you gain with a unifying device (TX / RX).Summary:  I love this keyboard because of how it looks and works.  Small fingerprint on your desktop ergonomic and comfortable.  Battery life I will assume depends on amount of usage. I have had mine a couple months now and are fully functional.  I keep a mental date in my head of when they were started so will know how long batteries last when the keyboard gets funky.  LOL.This is a wonderful set if you computer for hours on a daily schedule.
5,I absolutely love ❤️ this trio. Comfortable and versatile.
3,I really enjoyed the shape of this keyboard. The ergonomic shape didn’t take long to adjust to.  I really liked the detached number pad and the ergonomics mouse was very comfortable.  I used the keyboard for work using it for 8+ hours a day. However there’s are several reasons why I do not recommend this keyboard.First the dongle for the keyboard would disconnect and reconnect several times a minute.  I didn’t notice any issues with the keyboard or mouse though there were times it was slow to react to typing. I tried it in different USB ports and on two different systems and the results were the same so it is something to do with the hardware with hundreds of device faults showing up in the event viewer every hour.Second there is no indication on the keyboard or screen to indicate caps lock number lock etc.  There were numerous times the caps lock was on and I’d tap the caps lock and it wouldn’t turn it off and I’d lock myself out of applications.  It may have been a feature of the software if I had installed it. But this  was used for work and couldn’t install the software on my corporate laptop as it requires administrative privileges to install.  I wrongly assumed that since this was a Microsoft keyboard and mouse that no additional software would need to be installed. It worked but the functionality limited.Lately my company uses an archaic text based software and the traditional Function keys F1-F12 are extremely important. I’m a remote Support analyst so I’m on the phone all day and need to adjust the volume on my headset frequently.  Volume  control on the keyboard was controlled by the F11 and F12 buttons. The only way to override them was to flip a switch on the keyboard that toggled back and forth. The FN key did not override the the F Keys to adjust the volume. This may have required the desktop software to be installed.The layout of the keyboard isn’t the most intuitive either.  The insert button is in between the delete key and the backspace and I would constantly switch to overwrite by accidentally hitting insert instead of delete.Like most things Microsoft the keyboard and mouse concept is great the execution was poor and not intuitive.
5,I first got the keyboard when my wife saw a picture and we got one for her immediately and she loves it.  I was jealous and finally got the version with mouse for myself.I am delighted with the whole arrangement but I still must retrain my touch-typing muscle memory from the more-conventional layout.  I love the feel of the keyboard and of the keys.  The elevated palm rest is also great.The Mouse has a variety of controls.  I tend to use the Windows key on the mouse.  I changed the backspace side button to provide toggling of the mouse resolution/velocity which is handy for some drawing work.I do play PC cinematic 3rd person games via keyboard and mouse and these work fine for the games I play.Because this is a narrower keyboard with separate numeric island the arrow keys and their companions are more like a laptop arrangement than a wide PC keyboard.  That is taking the most adjustment for me.BONUS UPDATE 2021-04-26: The separate numerical island almost always not in Num Lock gives me important controls I can have *on*the*left* and I don't have to let go of my right-hand mouse.  Duhh.  Some things just became much easier.  Wowza.Two somewhat worrisome features are about batteries and the function key row.The function key row consists of very tiny buttons.  I use an under-desktop keyboard tray and that puts them almost out of sight.  The ones the most awkward to use are the audio controls the ones I use the most.For batteries one problem is the lack of a visible indicator on the keyboard and on the mouse for low battery or else I just don't know where they are.  The mouse can be turned off but there is no such control for the keyboard and the numeric pad.  It is also unfortunate that we are talking about AAA batteries not the usual AA ones.  I would use rechargeables but not certain how well rechargeable AAA do.  The detached numeric pad uses something else entirely and we'll see how that works.  I would have liked these devices to be rechargeable as well as cordless.
5,Took me a few days to get used to helps with proper wrist rest. I don’t think it will be good for gaming but have not tested it for that
4,Years ago I used one of the old ps/2 style Microsoft Ergonomic keyboards and thought it was great. Unfortunately they seemed to be more function over form (which for many is great) as design changed the original keyboards remained stuck in the past like an old couch.When my (other brand) keyboard started to feel funny as though it wasn't working properly I wanted something new different and more importantly stunning on my desk. I found the Sculpt Ergonomic set first and thought no no... The separate 10 key is going to drive me crazy or the vertical home/end/pg up/pg dwn layout will bug me. I ended up buying something else and being unhappy with it. My mind kept telling me go back to the Sculpt set!I took a trip to the Microsoft store and tried out the non ergonomic version of the keyboard and wasn't thrilled. However next to it was this one. After some time with it I was sold. Back home to Amazon and a few days later it was mine.I have small hands and it took a bit to adjust myself to stretching my pinky. I was worried it would be uncomfortable but it worked out. Definitely keep that in mind and try to play with it in the store if you're really worried. The split is very pronounced but feels very natural as does the key travel. This is as close as I can get to the old PowerBook keyboards before the "Dawn of the Chiclet Keys". The vertical home row is actually quite ergonomic I don't have to move my hand much to reach them.One thing to note I don't use Windows 8 which is what this set is really designed for as indicated by the shortcut Fn keys. Yes there is a switch to move between F1 being F1 or play/pause if you can get over that you should be okay. However if you are worried about compatibility with Windows 7 most of the blue function keys work fine play/pause volume up and down mute and Aero windows. What doesn't work is share (F6) search (F5) and a handful of others. I have not found a way to remap them (I'd LOVE to have a track forward/backward shortcut)The 10 key is quite handy. Interestingly I've found I don't use it as much as I used to since the horizontal row is within reach. That said the dedicated calculator button is super handy when balancing checkbook etc.As far as comfort that isn't related to the ergonomic applications... the padding on the keyboard is great though it does seem to be a little thin at the bottom edge. Not something I'm concerned with. Initially my hand felt unusual on the mouse but after a few days it was back to normal. Tracking on the mouse is great even though I use it on a mousepad. The magnetic closures on the bottom of the keyboard and mouse are secure and I do not worry about them falling off. Also scrolling is a dream! You need to install the Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center app (you don't have to do this it will work fine without but it's like having a stainless steel fridge you also get the other matching appliances). With the app you can customize scroll speed and cushioning much better than what I previously used.In all I'm quite happy with this set and hope it lasts for a long time. Also it is warrantied for 3 years with Microsoft jfyi!
4,As I mentioned I wish I'd checked it out more thoroughly as I have a few major gripes but unfortunately I have not managed to find any other keyboards offering anything like as good an experience despite it being so far from perfect.Pros:chiclet keyboard feels great.  I know some people want mechanical but I Iooked for an ergonomic mechanical and have not seen one anywhere near this price range that looks remotely as nice.  Also chiclet feels better than mechanical imo.feels as nice as it looks in terms of the curve and ergonomics.  the curved wide wrist rest is exceptional in every possible way.mouse is surprisingly responsive/accurate for wireless communication.  It weighs 136 grams (3x as much as my wired mouse because I am a fingertip grip freak that hates heavy/flat/large/nearly all gaming mice.)  and despite it's weight my wrist has not rejected it so it gets points.cons:F KEYS ARE NOT CHICLET!  Downside for me as one of my games is very fkey intensive.  They are probably designed to be a little more difficult to accidentally press but it bothers me.Wireless  Pretty decent in terms of responsiveness but nonetheless I was not looking for wireless.  I couldn't actually find any wired ergonomic chiclet/mechanical keyboards anywhere near my price range.The arrow keys are not where you would expect.  Coming from pretty much any laptop the chiclet will deceive you into thinking the up arrow is directly below the enter key but these are offset.  Very odd choice as it would me just easier to adapt to if it were a little bit more standard.  They clearly tried to cram too many keys onto the right side of the keyboard in an attempt to make it look more suave and symmetrical for the sake of advertising but they sacrificed logic and ergonomics.No backlight.  Not a huge deal for me but kind imo all keyboards $50+ should be backlit.This one is personal.  If you're like me you use your left index finger to type "y" the vast majority of the time.  There is a huge gap between the "t" and "y" keys that will take some getting used to.  I refuse to admit that it makes sense to have this gap.  I will argue to the day that I die that hitting "y" with the left index finger is more efficient.  The "y" key should either be on the left side or the gap should not be so big that it is unmanageable.  If you don't type like me then you are an idiot and wrong.Other thoughts:The mouse has a windows button which is just about the stupidest thing imaginable if you intend to use the mouse for anything other than a paperweight but fret not.  Despite windows doing what it can to disenable the user from reprogramming the button it is not too difficult to remap.  Simply download a keyboard remapping program (I used SharpKeys) and remap the RWin button to w/e you want.  I did browser forward.p.s.

5,i love the keyboard
5,I bought this in March 2022 - a replacement for one I very much enjoyed but physically damaged. Smooth soft keys and quiet enough. One combo package with a single Bluetooth usb plug in for all three components.
5,I loved it so much this is my second time purchasing this set.  My first set lasted almost 4 years.  I had to replace because the mouse and space bar went on the fritz (weren't reliable).  I work from home and have used the set M-F for at least 8 hours a day.  I really enjoy the separate 10key and use it daily.  Love!
4,Update on keyboard wrist pad:I noticed the wrist pad somewhat discolored since its a more porous surface and wondered how to clean it so I tried ArmorAll Leather Wipes (cleans conditions & Protects) and it worked great. Hope this helps. Its available at Walmart and here on Amazon also does a great job on leather.Naomi (Storm)  the Amazon vine reviewer did an excellent review and I would like to agree with it and add a couple things.I too am a long time Microsoft sculpt and ergonomic 4000 user and found the keyboard better than the older models but they moved the arrow keys and I am having a hard time getting used to that also moved page up down homeend keys but they were easier for me to get used to. The number keys are spaced different but they actually are easier to use now that i am used to them.  now for the number pad:I like that the keyboard is shorter because the number pad isn't part of the unit so now I don't have to reach so far for the mouse. I have also moved the keypad to the left of the keyboard and learned to use it with my left hand (i am right handed) so the mouse is on the right and keypad on the left very efficient. The number pad has the same switches as the keyboard so it feels good also.  The mouse:Well here we come to something a little different  the mouse was the big surprise to me! I loved it from the minute I put it in my hand it felt perfect like an extension of my hand but some people didn't like it and one girl couldn't even do a left click I couldn't believe it. So it looks like the mouse will either be fantastic right off (like for me) or take others a little time to get used to.Hope that helpsCON:One big con is that there are no lights for cap-lock or number-lock if you hit one it comes up in the corner of your screen for about 1 second then goes off if you miss that you have to turn it on and off to see if its activated.  I have a lot of programs open and a lot going on my screen and don't always see it so I get annoyed when I start typing in caps or my keypad doesnt work but its not a really big deal just have to hit the number lock or cap lock a few times to see if they are on it would have been nice to look down and see if a light was on.PRO:The keyboard is comfortable easy to use and very short learning curve (especially if you are a current sculpt or ergonomic user). The keys feel good not like mushy old Microsoft keys but not as nice as full mechanical cherry switches.
1,Update:The receiver has stopped working.  It's not my computer because I have another one of these setups at work and I brought it home to test out the computer.  So it is definitely the receiver.I have spent over 6 hours on the phone or in chat sessions with various incompetents in the MS tech support apparatus. First I tried to explain the problem to the Level 1 support lackey.  You plug the receiver and nothing happens the computer doesn't recognize it.  It doesn't work in any of my 3 USB ports.  My other USB peripherals all work including a different mouse.  It's the receiver.  It is dead.  It needs to be replaced.  Her solution let's update any driver that could have anything to do with a keyboard or mouse.  That didn't work.So I get elevated to a Level 2 support flunky.  He recommends doing a system restore to the last known date that the keyboard worked. That won't work either but whatever.  I'll let them do what they need to do before they realize it's hardware.  So he does a system restore to you know get rid of all of those driver updates L1 did and some unrelated Windows updates that won't matter.  He says he'll call me back in 45 minutes to an hour after the system restore completes.  He doesn't.  He calls me over 2 hours later at which point I had gave up and started cooking dinner and leaves me a message to call me back another day.He calls me back I show him it still doesn't work and he starts talking about "Well maybe we could..." and I tell him "Slow your roll it's hardware you need to replace the receiver.  Aren't you convinced yet?"  He reluctantly agrees and tells me I can go get some in person hardware support at my nearest Microsoft store over 1.5 hours away in another state.  I told him that didn't really work for me and he suggested I go to Amazon and request it.  I asked how he said that if I went into my orders there would be something I could click in the order to request a replacement and I said I don't think that's right but I'll try it.Of course it wasn't right.  I get on chat support.  I get a guy who seems like he is actually going to help me.  He tells me "here's a request number go get in touch with sales by clicking this series of things give them the request number and they'll get you taken care of."  So I went to try that immediately but the second thing in the series of clicks didn't actually exist on the page for me to click.  I try to tell him as much I'm typing and I know he can see it just like I can see when he is typing and basically says "K THX BYE!!!" and disconnects the session.Since then I have been stuck in MS telephone support hell.  I think there's a note on my file or number that says "Make sure you f@ck with guy for a while and then hang up on him.  AT NO POINT SHOULD HE EVER GET ANY REAL HELP!!!"  I keep calling getting passed around to different people none of which can ever actually send me the part.  I've remained cordial no cursing despite a deep burning desire to unload on them and I keep trying.  I don't understand.I would buy it if I could.  Logitech sells replacements for their stuff for $10.  But MS doesn't.  I would have to buy a whole new keyboard and mouse set.  I've been on the phone with them while I write this.  If this last person doesn't help (I'm on my 7th call and I've talked to maybe 10 different people) I'm going to go buy a Logitech set.  This is ridiculous.  Oh they just hung up on me again.  Guess I'm done with them.Original Review:Great product. I really like the ergonomics. It helped relieve wrist pain I was experiencing from working on a computer 8-12 hours a day.The mouse is weird at first but I've gotten used to it.I thought the separate number pad was dumb at first but now I like it. You can keep it out of the way when you don't need it and you can use it on either side of the keyboard when you do want it. I trained myself to use it left handed so I could navigate the mouse with my right at the same time. This is really great for some tasks like entering lots of numerical data into a form or spreadsheet.The only problem I've had is that the number pad has recently had an issue with losing connectivity briefly. I'll go to use it and I'll have to hit a number key 234...20 times before it suddenly wakes up and starts working again. The battery is only a couple months old after another battery lasting over a year so I don't think that's the issue. It's a minor inconvenience but it is annoying.
4,Great keyboard.  There are really only a few "ergonomic" keyboards to choose from but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this set to anyone.  I have been using it for 3 years and it's still my daily go-to work keyboard where I do a lot of typing regularly.  The key action and feel is nice and doesn't degrade as quickly as a regular membrane keyboard (I'm not sure mechanically how these are designed).  I like the chiclet style keys because the key throw is shorter than a regular membrane keyboard or a mechanical keyboard so I find I can type faster on this than a regular keyboard.  The split numberpad is kind of nice and kind of annoying at the same time.  It's nice because they keyboard is almost as wide as my regular rectangular keyboard WITH numberpad so I can just put it off to the side when I don't need it.  But it's something extra to keep track of and if you're used to a regular key layout things are in a slightly different place even if you slide the numberpad right along side the keyboard.  Notably the arrows home end pgup pgdn insert and delete keys are different than normal.  After a couple weeks of adjusting breezing through excel wasn't a problem though so I won't dock it for that.The mouse is okay.  I like the attempt at ergonomics and it does feel better after long periods of use.  But the click is kind of mushy and it really needs a finer sensor on it for today's use.  If you use a 1080p monitor you'll probably be fine but 1440p or 4k really require a faster mouse and more precision than this mouse can offer which is a bit of a bummer.  I've put up with it for the extra ergonomic benefits though and it's been alright.I would have given 5 stars but my USB wireless transceiver broke on me 2 months out of warranty.  Contrary to some "answers" to questions out there every USB transceiver is linked with the keyboard numberpad and mouse at the factory - they are not replaceable and you cannot purchase a second one as a backup or for another device.  On the plus side I called Microsoft warranty support and they sent me a brand new keyboard/mouse/numberpad/USB set to replace mine with a bad USB transceiver.  In my opinion this was over and above what they said they would do and I am thrilled with the service.  But I have to take a star off for the lack of foresight in the design.  People will lose or break the USB transceiver well before the keyboard or mouse go bad - why they thought it was a good idea to make these proprietary and irreplaceable I do not know.Overall very very happy with this set.  Highly recommended.
5,I have carpal tunnel in both hands and it’s great! The keyboard size is about a tenkeless keyboard and it’s very ergonomic and I don’t feel the Esc key uncomfortable as some said. But it’s weird that the 6 key is on the left side and not on the right side but nothing to worry. It’s well made and I have nothing to regret about it. I painted some corners with correction fluid to know where to put my fingers and I also discarded  (took out the battery) of the numpad because I preferred to have an old Razer Tartarus Chroma as numpad. With the more space that the keyboard gave me I can easily reach my spacemouse enterprise and the right mouse. I had the logitech mx vertical and it was good but because of the same it was difficult to control sometimes but this mouse it excellent at least for me because the angle is enough to free the carpal tunnel. The only complain is that I would prefered that the angle of the arrangement of the key will be like the right side but mirrored to the left side (the right side is tilt to the left like in all regular keyboards) but I understand it’s because how regular keyboard are made AND it works good as it is don’t try to change where the fingers go it won’t work I tried and the result is an extrange and uncomfortable angle. It’s actually the “best” I’ve seen
3,The layout is great just what I was looking for. In fact I am going to take full advantage of it to improve my typing skills. In particular I want to remove certain vices like using my right hand to press keys on the left side of the keyboard en viceversa.However there are some issues that make the keyboard harder to use:1. The function key switch. WTF!!! I wouldn't have bought this keyboard if I knew it didn't have a function key. It is really annoying to use a hard switch to use all the functions. Unbelievable.2. The escape key is kinda stuck.. Come on! It a new piece of hardware that was made by a robot. This should not happen! In fact all narrower keys are a little harder to press.Sadly I cannot return it because I live abroad so I will be stuck with this little guy for a while.The mouse is great btw.
4,Overall I must say that the Sculpt keyboard and mouse are very good.  The keystrokes on the keyboard are shorter than your classic keyboard.  But come on this isn't 1992 anymore and we don't need those deep cavernous keystrokes found on the Apple IIE complete with green-screen. The ergonomics of the keyboard are well placed and well thought out.  The only downside lies with the realization that you've built your typing around landmarks on the standard keyboard layout and this new layout in conjunction with the slightly tweaked angles will have you missing 'home' .  At first my word count dropped to one with that word being 'iuytwqwepri'. If you hotkey (i.e. ctrl + Z ctrl + X etc) you might find that it takes a little longer due to the bigger buttons found at the bottom.  This may seem counter-intuitive but when you index off the sides of the key in regards to your position it makes some sense.  In addition the backspace key has a tendency to pop up when you're not expected it.  I've lost count of the number of times I've meant to hit the '-' or '+' sign and gone back instead.  The directional arrow keys have also moved so if you're thinking about playing video games on this keyboard left-handed you might want to think about another option.On that note the mouse can only be used with your right hand due to the curves and thumb groove.  A hidden 'back' button for surfing the web is helpful although I wish there was a subsequent 'forward' button as well.  Next to the 'back' button there sits a blue 'windows' button.  For the life of me I don't know why Microsoft is intent of plastering this button everywhere.  I have never used it.  Moreover the button lacks the combined shortcuts found with the 'Mac' button and only does one thing; bring up the start menu.  Like most people I add the programs that I use most to the desktop perhaps this was another misguided attempt to force people to use that horrid Windows 8 live tile start screen which we all promptly ignored.Moving on the separate 10 key portion is a welcome change.  I like the fact that it is movable and has a backspace button on the top left corner.  The added calculator button is also helpful for quick on the spot calculations.  The keystrokes are short and responsive like the main keyboard.All it all it is a nice setup aside from being a little pricey and the time it takes to relearn it is a very good setup.  If you sit at a computer for some or all of the day you might want to try it for yourself provided you don't already have a setup you like.
4,I purchased this set to use in my home office to replace a very 'loud' keyboard and corded mouse. It's connected to a laptop docking station and works flawlessly. The mouse tracks extremely well and is comfortable to use all day long. The keyboard is so quiet  people no longer hear me typing on conference calls. :) It does take a week or two to adjust to the slightly different layout of the keys. The separate keypad works well but I wish MS had an option to buy it connected to the keyboard. Mine will never leave my keyboard's side.I loved this setup so much I bought a 2nd set for my personal computer. This time things didn't work so well...at first. The keyboard was great but the mouse did not track well at all. I do photography editing and the mouse was jumping all over the place.* * * F I X * * *I did some research and found it was due to interference with the USB wireless controller being too close to the computer. That sounded silly at first since USB ports are ON the computer but then I remembered I have USB ports on my monitor. I used one of those ports and it has worked perfectly ever since. (If you don't have USB ports other than the ones on the computer a USB extension cable can be used to put some distance between the USB wireless controller and the computer). Hopefully this helps others out as I was ready to return it and just happened to stumble on the fix.The 4 star rating is due to the keyboard easily picking up skin oils and showing use after only a few weeks. I clean it often but there are marks where my palms rest on the keyboard. My old Microsoft natural keyboard took years to show this kind of wear marks. Because of that I'm not sure how durable the material is or how long the keyboard and mouse will last in general.. Hopefully they live up to the life of the Natural keyboard's and nice (none of my Natural keyboard's have letters showing on the bottom and right side because they've had so much use - and they all still work!)
4,Unlike the old Microsoft Natural keyboard and the various keyboards with mechanical switches this keyboard has short keystroke action more like modern laptop and Apple aluminum keyboards. I had a lot of trouble with those others with key travel of a half centimeter sometimes more which feels mushy to me and even in my short trial periods aggravated my tendonitis/RSI even more than the normal flat keyboards do.Pros* Short keystroke action which makes it more familiar to people accustomed to modern keyboards.* Slight arc to the key grid making it slightly more comfortable than the strict diagonals.* Easy to adapt to. The differences are slight enough that you don't need to learn how to type all over again.* Angle and rise are comfortable and easy on the wrist angle avoiding pronation.* Padded wrist-rests add to the comfort and ergonomics.* Lightweight and stable. This isn't some big thick breadbox on your desk..* Wireless + battery. I don't really consider this a plus preferring Bluetooth if not USB but some people will like this. The keyboard uses two AAA batteries which are included.Cons:* While keyboard works okay with Mac the alt (which serves as option) and windows (which serves as Command) are reversed forcing new typing habits for the common things like Command-x Command-c Command-v. This is why I give 4 stars not 5.* The keyboard is not adjustable aside from attaching a piece of plastic to change the elevation angle. However I find the default position comfortable enough.* The keystroke action while shorter than the mechanical keyboards and Microsoft Natural keyboard is still a touch longer than I'd like. (The Goldtouch does better on this.)* It's a bit loud and clacky especially the spacebars. Because of the rigid arced base there's also a bit of a drumming sound as you type. I'm not sure if there's any way to quiet this down.* Not portable. If you want something to take with your laptop this isn't it. It's lightweight but it's still too bulky to slip into a laptop bag.* Wireless + battery. Two things that can cause problems. If you're concerned about security this is not the keyboard for you.I'm not using the mouse preferring my Apple mouse.Recommendation: If you're accustomed to laptop and/or Apple keyboards this is one of the few ergonomic keyboards that you will find comfortable and familiar. But Mac users should be aware that they will need to relearn some keystrokes learn to edit the keyboard in Terminal or download a keyboard remapping app to swap the keys.
4,I bought this for my new Apple iMac desktop computer. For the life of me I don't know why Apple does not make it's own ergonomic keyboard and/or mouse but they don't. I've been a PC/Windows user for 30 years and have used some form of ergonomic keyboard for many of those years. So when I got my new Mac I definitely wanted to keep my keyboard. My go-to manufacturer Logitech didn't have an Apple compatible product and I searched everywhere for one. Finally went to Microsoft and found this one. It works great for me. I had no problems plugging in the dongle and having it work perfectly right out of the box. It doesn't have 100% of the same functionality as the Apple keyboard such as the 'command' key. The 'Windows' key does not have the same functionality as the 'command' key. That is the main difference I can find; however like I said - I'm a new Apple iMac user and a long-time user of the Apple keyboard may find many more limitations than I have. I have been using it for digital photo editing and graphic art and love it. The one other peeve I have about this keyboard is that there is no light on the caps lock key like any other keyboard I've ever used. It's not that big a deal until you forget its on when you're entering passwords which is where I find it irritating; because I do use my caps lock key for various applications in my work. But - that's me and I could see where it wouldn't be so irritating to others. Other slight drawback for me is the distance between keys mostly on the upper row (qwertyuiop) the distance between say the F key and the T key is greater than I'm used to and had to learn to reach or stretch my fingers further when typing. However I don't seem to be having any fatigue or soreness issues in my hands and fingers so far and I do a lot of typing - still I personally would have liked to have the keys a bit closer together as in most of Microsoft's and Logitech's models. The keys do have a pretty soft touch and it's very quiet no clatter when typing. It's well made and feel sturdy and has enough weight to it to feel good under your hands. I personally love that the 10-key pad is separated from the board as I can place it wherever it's most comfortable for me. Overall I'm happy with the keyboard - a little pricey but if you have an Apple desktop and want an ergonomic keyboard it seems we are kind of stuck with the cost for now.
4,I really like this desktop set. Like many I spend too much time in front of the computer and I wanted to get something a little more ergonomic. First I purchased the evoluent vertical mouse and a corded Microsoft ergonomic keyboard.I liked the vertical mouse concept but the evoluent was a bit of an overkill difficult to get used to (has three main buttons instead of two second button does not perform the same as on normal mouse I just kept pushing the wrong button - several other buttons that I have no use for) and I found it not so great for precise handling needed when using solid works or graphic software. I guess it was a bit too much of a mouse revolution for me. The mouse in this set also has the benefit of keeping your wrist in a more natural position (it is truly a lot more comfortable and I my wrist is noticeably less strained) but still feels like a good old mouse (to me anyway).The corded Microsoft natural keyboard was just WAY too big I mean it is huge I was shocked when I unboxed it ("Do they still make them like this?") but I did like the split layout. Also I found the large keys to be a bit pre-historic I am so used to the laptop-type keys by now. So I sent both back and got this. It is a lot more comfortable than a standard desktop set neither keyboard nor mouse took me more than five minutes to get used to. I love the fact that the numerical block is separate I use the calculator on my PC a lot. Now I can just put the num block wherever I need it at the moment on my desk. An added bonus to this is the more compact keyboard which writes and feels great. I was first put off by the fact that this set uses batteries for environmental and economical reasons (I don't really need a cordless set) but I simply got some rechargeable batteries for it problem solved. The num block (which doesn't take rechargeable batteries) shouldn't require battery changes often I imagine. And actually It is kind of neat not to have to deal with so many cables on the desk.My only minor complaints and reason not to give five stars: The num block has to be turned on every time you start the PC (or am I missing something?) which I find annoying because I use a PIN to sign in to my PC. There is no light to indicate whether it is on or not. Same with Caps Lock no light. For the price two little LED's would have been nice.
5,I've used the various split MS ergo keyboards for 20 years; I'm a fan of the split keyboard concept - people with broad-ish shoulders will appreciate not straining to get your wrists properly positioned using a normal keyboard.The keys have a proper amount of 'clicky' tactile feedback.  The Home/End/PgUp/PgDn/Insert keys are in an unfamiliar arrangement on the keyboard; I'm still getting used to that.  The function keys are vertically half the size of normal keys.  If you use lots of the old F1-F12 keys you have to get used to being a bit more accurate to press those without hitting the numeric keys.  A physical switch on the top right lets you switch to the various system control functions (window management search audio etc. all of which can be configured.The separate keypad lets me put it elsewhere when I'm not using it constantly which means the mouse is closer to the main keyboard (a good thing).The mouse is nicely fatter vertically which fits my hand.  The extra Windows logo button is moderately useful.  The somewhat-hidden button below and to the side of the windows logo button defaults to browser back.  Meh.  These can be changed.  But really the extra buttons on mice have never done much for me.  Scroll wheel does what its supposed to do for vertical scrolling.  It also does horizonal scrolling by rocking the scroll wheel.The one thing that I'm missing is being able to configure the split spacebar.  IMHO the left spacebar should be configurable as backspace.  This seems to be missing from a Win 10 implementation;  might have worked on Win 7.One missing feature is a back-lit keyboard.  Considering that it is battery powered (wireless) this probably shouldn't be surprising.
5,I have used Microsoft ergonomic keyboards for years. In my opinion their ergonomic keyboards are the best. This keyboard is the best Microsoft Ergonomic keyboard I have ever used. It is a little more ergonomic extreme than the others I have used which I love. The keys are perfect for my touch. The palm rest is a nice soft texture. It is a well built keyboard. Has some heft to it. Love this keyboard.This is the first ergonomic mouse I have ever used. I was a little leery on how I would like it. This mouse is freakin awesome. I love it. It fits great in the hand and is responsive in every way. Love the way it feels and the way it performs.The external keypad is OK. Seems like it misses some numbers at times. If I were an accountant and used the ten key a lot my trust would be a little lacking. Honestly I wish the 10-key was part of the keyboard. I find myself reaching for the 10-key. It is hard to find a good place to put it on my desk. It kind of gets in the way. Not a real big fan of this external 10-key. It is OK. Out of the 3 pieces to this combo the 10-key is my least favorite feature. However the keys feel great. It is a good piece. See I am on the fence with the external 10-key. I have kind of a love hate relationship with it. Its great at times but a pain at other times. It is a good piece and a bad piece. You decide.Overall I am very satisfied with the Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Wireless Desktop Keyboard and Mouse - L5V-00001. Microsoft makes high quality computer accessories and this combo meets this quality specification. I am a computer programmer so I use this for at least 8-hours a day. So far it has held up. I have in no way been paid or rewarded for this review. I do not work for Microsoft. I just love their keyboards.
4,I'm not used to ergonomic keyboards but I've been doing a lot more typing lately and thought I'd give an ergo setup a try.  It did take me a while to get used to the keyboard layout and typing the "6" key with my left hand instead of my right hand.  But after getting used to the key location differences I've really come to love this keyboard. The mouse movement is smooth and works great on different surfaces. I also like the magnetic riser.  It's great to be able to remove it when I am using my set up at a standing desk or attach it when I'm sitting down.Pros:  - Magnetic riser and magnetic battery doors  - USB receiver storage in the mouse's battery compartment  - Compact design  - Detached keypadCons:  - 6 key and backspace key are in awkward locations - but just takes a little getting used to  - Uses AA and AAA batteries (and a watch battery for the keypad)  It would be nice to use the same battery size for mouse and keyboard  - Not backlit - but this saves battery lifeHow I use this set up:I have a laptop that I use both at home and at work.  I have this keybaord/mouse set up at home and at work (2 separate units).  At work I have the receiver plugged into my docking station.  At home I plug the receiver into the back of my laptop. (I don't have a docking station at home)  I haven't had any driver conflicts and it's been working great for me.One issue to note:  The receiver I had at home was faulty.  My keyboard and mouse suddenly stopped working.  I deleted the drivers and replaced the batteries.  Plugged in the receiver let the drivers install (successful install) - keyboard and mouse would not function. I brought the laptop to my office and put it into the docking station. My set up at the office worked just fine.  This led me to believe that there was a problem with my receiver at home not with the drivers.  I called Microsoft and after about 20 minutes of arguing with them that it wasn't a driver or computer issue but it was a faulty reveiver they sent me a new set up.  I received the new set up yesterday plugged it in and it worked flawlessly.  :)
3,I have unfortunately they are a wired and wireless.  Two slightly different key layout causes me to mistype.  Probably a great keyboard if this is all your used to but it’s a bit frustrating for me since I’ve used a different layout for years now.
4,The keyboard is quite nice although probably not the best quality. Had to exchange the first one that arrived because the "esc" key was broken off the keyboard. The replacement had no missing keys but sometimes the left space bar gets stuck - I don't slam my fingers on my keyboard which for that left space bar at times you need to hit it hard.I can't tell if my wrist feels much better than with a non ergonomic keyboard but I think it helps a bit. I also like the magnetic closure to the battery spaces and the additional stand to tilt the keyboard. Overall it's nice and a fair price.
4,Update on June 5 2019.  How much do I love this keyboard? Purchasing my third one since September 2018. Inset head smack!  Broke the dongle of the first set during a rushed packing up my my stuff. Thought I would be smart by buying an insurance policy on the second set. Unfortunately it does not cover acts of stupidity such as spilling coffee all over your mouse by accident.  My mouse was leaking it out through the batteries.  Still without a doubt the most comfortable ergonomic well-designed except for the size of that ridiculously large dongle.———I’m a huge fan of this keyboard and mouse and number pad combination. How big of a fan? I Purchased it three times. Why would I need to buy three times.  Despite Microsoft designing an amazingly comfortable three-piece set the weakness continues to lie in the USB dongle.  It’s exceptionally fragile. Any damage to the dongle renders the entire unit useless. So if you ever need to transport your laptop please make care to take the dongle out carefully and insert it into its caring slot inside the mouse.  If you bend it look at it funny etc. you will break the dongle. Honestly there is no need to make the dongle this huge.  Logitech has mouse and keyboard combinations with a much smaller USB dongle.  However I’m not as big a fan of the Logitech comfort as I am of the Microsoft option Because I use this for up to 10 to 12 hours a day for work I insist on having the most comfortable one.  Love the Chiclet design as well as the powder coating. The power coat does wear off but since I have a tendency to not get more than 9 to 12 months out of a set before I inadvertently break the dongle it’s not a big deal. Sigh...  this set would get a five star rating otherwise ....
4,For some odd reason if I just plug the wireless receiver dongle into a USB port the keyboard drops keypresses like crazy and the mouse movement is very jerky & stuttery. This was true with my laptop (with the dongle only a foot or two away!) and a desktop (dongle 3-4' away) in a completely different location. But one my co-workers happened to have a USB extension cable so now the dongle can be mere inches away from my keyboard & mouse (wireless -- hah!) and everything works.Before buying this I spilled on my beloved MS Natural Ergonomic Keyboard which I'd used for years. I wondered if this would be worthy successor. I think it largely is & I'm happy with it. Comparison: * Same general shape means I could get back to typing as I was used to quickly. * I LOVE the removable numeric keypad & I love having it out of the way until those times I need it (or on the left side if you prefer). I use the mouse FAR more than the numeric keypad so I love having the mouse closer. * That said the arrow keys & Home/End/PgUp/PgDn are in slightly different spots than the MS Natural Ergonomic Keyboard and this means I lose some muscle memory efficiency when going for those keys as I have to stumble around a bit. Thankfully they are less often used so I can live with it and I'm learning the new locations. * The mouse seems a touch overpriced to me but I do like it and very quickly adapted to it. * The shorter chiclet keys are slightly easier to type with in my opinion. In any event chiclet keyboards are everywhere these days. * I agree with other reviews that complain that the function keys seem oddly cheap. Again these are not as often used. * I slightly miss having the Zoom rocker that the MS Natural Ergonomic Keyboard had in the middle but I otherwise don't miss any of the other keys for opening up media players etc. I'm perfectly happy hitting the Windows key and running these from the Start menu.
5,Somewhat difficult learning curve but a rewarding and high quality experience once you start getting a feel for it.I was wary with some of the specific negatives that others mentioned but this set most closely matched what I was looking for and I am very glad I took the chance.I'm not going to do the most detailed review. This is my first experience with an ergonomic or split keyboard design. It's initially extremely alien but makes your hands feel good as you type. The key action feels and sounds pleasing. The layout feels right even when your hands don't have the muscle memory or coordination to use it right yet.Wrist pain when typing with this is basically gone. Much pain with a standard flat keyboard.It continues to feel more and more natural to me so much that I can mostly touch type with occasional looks at the keyboard to get a reference point after about a week of using it sparingly each day.Wrist/palm pad is very supportive when resting the hands between bouts of typing.The lack of LED to show CAPS lock etc. is a non-issue because it shows that status on your screen. You just have to install the microsoft keyboard and mouse software. Also to this point with the software I feel like the mouse became smoother and more precise once I installed that.The function key and ESC row is admittedly very small so this would not be a great keyboard for gaming but would be fine for software developers provided you get used to the small function keys.Onto the mouse. It's tall round and heavy. The action is smooth and precise. It seems to work on any surface which is a huge upgrade for me and exactly what I needed as I am using this as a wireless living room keyboard and mouse.The mouse is somewhat awkward and also has a muscle memory development curve. The added Back and Windows start buttons are welcome additons.I actually am enjoying the weight of the mouse. My old mouse would go flying when you accidentally nudged it which was indescribably infuriating. This mouse feels more solid and stable.On the actual quality it is what I expect from Microsoft. Everything feels quite premium and like it will last. Worthy of the price. Very precise action and build quality on all moving parts. Materials and surfaces feel good to touch. Some people's don't like the gloss black but I am a fan of it in this instance.Overall I'm very pleased and liking it more and more as I get used to it.
4,Likes:The split design is much easier on my wrists and hands than traditional keyboards and the shallow key action I think has significantly improved my typing speed.The Control keys are a symmetrical distance from the split and are large compared to other keyboards which makes them easy to access comfortably with either hand.The keyboard is relatively compact for a split design and the complete separation of the number pad definitely helps manage real estate on my desk.The mouse felt slightly unusual at first and is a bit heavy but it actually fits perfectly in my hand as it naturally rests and I like it now.Dislikes:I often work on remote Linux servers so I'm on the command line for most of my day.  The escape key on this keyboard along with all of the function keys is tiny which is unfortunate because it's a critical key for anyone who works in vi.  It's still placed at the traditional position at the extreme top left so I've trained my hand to feel for the left edge and corner of the keyboard to find it but I still wish it was a little larger and had the same action as the other keys.  Also the alternate functions of those keys are toggled with a very small switch at the top right of the keyboard which is really a pain when controlling master volume and mute.The recession in the mouse that accommodates the thumb has a button on the vertical portion that's depressed by sort of squeezing the mouse.  Unless I use my pinkie or ring finger near the bottom right edge of the mouse to oppose the thumb I'll accidentally right click almost every time I use it.  It's a relatively useful button because it's mapped to the Back function in browsers but using it effectively took some conscious effort at first and it still doesn't feel completely natural.When I first got the keyboard some of the keys (e and spacebar for me) made a very high pitched squeak as they were being depressed and that was extremely annoying.  However after continuing to use it for several days (maybe close to a week) the continued use broke them in and that problem has gone away.The padding in the wrist rest is very thin and this is really my biggest complaint although it wouldn't keep me from suggesting this keyboard to others.
3,The ergonomics and wirelessness are great except that there is some obscure compatibility issue.  It can disconnect from the computer several times a day requiring the transmitter to be moved to another USB socket to restart the device.  Also very bizarrely the springs in my recliner can somehow alter the radio signals to trigger the computer awakening from sleep mode as if I had pressed the keyboard.
5,This is an excellent keyboard if you don't need a great deal of tilt between your wrists. The keys are short throw about medium resistance and clicky style but not noticably loud in my opinion. I wish the mouse was a bit taller becuase my pinky falls off but thats not even a CON to me. Overall I love the quality and attention to detail put into this product I really applaud Microsoft for its overall focus on making this a fun product to own.CONS:1. Almost entirely not adjustable. However it does come with a bar for the keyboard that puts a bit of forward tilt into the keyboard. This is actually why I bought it because I really couldn't find that for less than $100 on any other product. Its perfect for when I'm standing and its removable for when I'm sitting.2. See my pro's next but here's one oversight that I can nitpick about. All the battery compartments close magnetically except the numpad! Otherwise I can't get over how cool the magnetic battery covers are.3. Microsoft NEEDS to improve this. This is the most annoying part and it might determine whether I get their next generation whenever that hits. When you haven't been using the keyboard for more than (it feels like) a minute I think the device goes into a battery saving mode. You will ALWAYS miss the first keystroke and you will miss more if your quick. It sounds like a tough problem but I would expect a tech giant to be able to fix it.PROs:1. MAGNETIC BATTERY COMPARTMENTS ARE COOL. This is part of the overall quality I love about this product. Its not a huge deal but the little things are what shape customer perception about how their product was designed and if Microsoft really wanted to impress us.2. Separate numpad is really handy! Combined with the calculator hotkey I have carried this thing across the lab to an instrument to punch in numbers and its very handy. Has the same keystroke problem but if you know that its manageable.3. The mouse is spectacular it holds the dongle magnetically too so its really reliable.4. Function switch at the topright lets you switch between the specially hotkeys in blue or the F1-F12 keys that are normally there. This is nice becuase I really hate the "Fn" key that you need to use on most laptops.5. The divider in the middle of the keyboard is almost dead center while still providing many of the right hand keys that are most usefull.
4,This review is only for the keyboard. The mouse is useless to me.It feels great. My first impression upon using it was like sliding into the seat of a luxury sedan. The rubber of the keys and wrist rest feel silky smooth and solid. The key action is shallow but firm.I love the layout. As a programmer I use nearly every key and they are all important. This layout is pretty much how I would have designed it given the chance. I've tried just under a dozen keyboards over the last few years but they only did one or two things right. The Kinesis Freestyle got the ergonomics right but totally failed on the keyboard layout. Others had acceptable layouts but lacked ergonomics. None of them brought together the right set of features like this one does. Here's the short list of where they failed and this one succeeds:- Doesn't put the function key where L-Ctrl key is.- Has a wrist rest.- Includes the Application key.- Keeps the Fn key out of the way.- Has some ergonomics to it.- No superfluous keys for cut-copy-paste etc...This is the first one to meet my needs or most of them any ways. One thing I would have liked to see a little more of is customizability via key mapping. The software makes it easy to re-map only the Play/Pause key.  The only key I don't need is the Calculator key just above the Delete key on the right side. However the software prevents it from being overridden via AutoHotkey. I had to uninstall the software to allow it to work the way I wanted it to. I don't have this problem with the other keys; AutoHotKey works on the rest of the keyboard. Still that basically requires a key combo to perform an action as opposed to a single key press for the same action. A couple of keys dedicated to custom re-mapping would be perfect.The last thing they failed on was the split spacebar....no backspace on the L-spacebar! This was a tremendous feature that showed MS could think outside the box. Whoever decided to drop this feature should be fired. Unfortunately both the left and right spacebar produce the same keycode so AHK can not distinguish between the two leaving me without a workaround...ugh!Docking one star for not having a backspace-spacebar.
4,Got this as a panicked solution to my worsening carpal tunnel. I’m a copywriter and do a bunch of Excel work too so my wrists have been getting more and more painful. Mouse work with a rather flat mouse was also giving me tendonitis through my thumb and ball of my palm. Both my manager and my coworker recommended this set to me and called it a “game-changer”.Scored an open box deal on the whole set and arrived just after lunch! Outside packaging did look resealed and had a couple random stickers on it but other than those and a little rip right where the numeric pad is nestled it doesn’t doesn’t look like the item would be damaged. There are a few very minor scuffs and a teensy bit of dust on the keyboard’s wrist rest but they’re out of sight and I only noticed them coz I really tried to look for them.Setup was almost too easy. I think being able to stow the USB Bluetooth dongle in the mouse is so clever! I haven’t gotten the numeric pad to work but it’s coz I still have to get a flat screwdriver to open the battery compartment to check if the battery is still good. Also the Windows button on the mouse lets you go Back. Once I remember it’s there I’m sure it’ll be very convenient.After only 3.5 hours of use right out the box I can definitely agree about it being a game-changer. I didn’t have to keep pausing to flex/shake the pain from my wrists anymore. I thought I’d still need a wrist pad for the mouse but turns out it’s so dome-y your wrist naturally straightens. I may still buy a pad though just to avoid misalignment all together.I’ll try to update my review once these fresh batteries need changing and when I do get to use the numeric keypad.
4,*Update* after about 11 months of service the keyboard started having issues: the left Ctrl key stopped working and the battery light was on constantly even after replacing the batteries. I called Microsoft for warranty service (this product has a 3-year warranty!) and the experience was quite pleasant. I received a replacement set within 5 business days. I did have to ship the defective keyboard back at my own expense but overall I consider Microsoft service to be excellent.--- original review ---I love the ergonomics of the keyboard. It does greatly reduce wrist strain. The split keyboard is a lot easier to get used to than I expected - all it took was about 30 minutes of typing and I am able to blind type on this keyboard as fast as I could on regular keyboards (funny things is - switching back to the regular laptop keyboard now requires a short transition period where I keep hitting the wrong keys. It's a minor annoyance that I hope I can overcome over time).  The mouse also works very well and takes no time to get used to. You hand will be at about 45 degrees angle from horizontal - about half way between a regular mouse and a vertical mouse.The detached numpad is an interesting design choice. I actually have no problem with it. This allows me to place it to the left of the keyboard so I can use my left hand to do the occasional number input while reducing the distance my right hand travels between the keyboard and mouse. If you use the numpad a lot however this may not work so well for you.Now for a number of issues that prevented me to give this product a 5-star rating. The function key row (including the all-so-important ESC key) is the biggest issue. They are little buttons that are half the size of the regular keys. Also instead of having a Fn key to shift between F1-F10 and special function keys (volume/mute/media etc) this is instead controlled by a tiny switch in the upper right corner.  For someone like me who uses the function keys quite regularly this can really slow me down some times.The keyboard also doesn't come with any indicator lights so it is not possible for me to quickly find out if the states of Num Lock and  Caps Lock.
5,I'm giving it 5 because overall after you're use to it it's really great!As ergonomic keyboards go this one took me a week to get use to - really bad the first day! Still adjusting to it but... I like it a lot! The keys press easily so you aren't banging away - you can really fly on this thing. Not having all the extra crapola on the top of the keyboard that none of us ever used is great too - no clutter!  Another adjustment is the separate number pad but finding I really really like that too. You can adjust it to the angle you want and it stays put pretty much - doesn't slide around like you would expect because it does have good rubber button feet on it. The cushion on the bottom of the board for your wrists is soft and slides smoothly as well.My only Huh? came when I pulled out the bottom support for the keyboard.  It snaps on easily right under the WRIST area in the FRONT of the keyboard lifting it almost an inch so that the keyboard tilts AWAY from YOU and towards the computer. Make sense as ergonomically your wrists and fingers want to go forward and down but doesn't change the weird factor when you first try it. And when you actually put that into practice with that lift under the key board THAT is going to take a long time to get used to! I don't use the lift right now - the keyboard and angle are great with the keyboard just sitting on the table.Still I really like the  feel and use of the keyboard. 5 out of 5 on the keyboard.Mouse - gets a B or 4 Stars because the bottom doesn't stay on the mouse. You'd think its broken but it's not. It just doesn't stay on. So I leave it off - don't look at the bottom of it anyhow and it still slides and moves juts fine. Again because it's big and different it takes some getting use to but really like the thumb rest. And if you have Windows 8 or 10 the extra button is good without getting in the way.Finally I like that it only uses 1 USB for the keyboard and the mouse.  The mouse needs a couple AA batteries and the keyboard needs 2 AAA but only 1 USB to run them both so that saves outlet space on the computer.So yes I'd recommend for those who type a lot and type fast - it's great on the wrists!
3,I bought this a replacement to my existing Microsoft Natural Ergonomic 4000.Pros:Keyboard:  1. Scissor key style requires significantly less pressure to activate than the old MS Natural 4000.  2. Decent height adjustment.  3. Extremely quiet.  4. "Split" spacebar (spacebar is two buttons easily reachable by either hand and requires the same pressure as a normal key.)  5. Same "split" key style as the MS Natural Ergonomic 4000.  If you're used to that you'll have no issues with most tasks with this keyboard.  6. "Delete" button added.  This is handy if you're coming from a Mac background.  (Keyboard has both "Backspace" and "Delete" keys)  7.  "floating" keypad.  For some this could be a real boon (not so much for me but maybe others will like it.)Cons:Keyboard:  1. Extremely poor function keys.  The function keys are in fact buttons and not keys.  2. No media or other keys:  Did you use any of the media keys on the MS Natural Ergonomic 4000?  They're gone.  Replaced by a crappy slider to toggle function "buttons" from F1 to F12 to media keys.  3. Home Page Up Page Down End Insert and Delete are all crammed together on the right side of the keyboard.  On the MS Natural it was extremely easy to locate these by touch alone not so much any longer.  They're in a different place as well.  4. No indicators:  There are no longer Capslock NumberLock and ScrollLock indicators.Mouse:The mouse is a monstrosity the size and shape of a softball cut in half.  You will not be able to use this in many desk keyboard trays.  Unless you like huge unwieldy mice buy this keyboard without it.Keypad:  1. "Floating" style keypad makes for slow use if you're used to it being attached  2. "NumLock" is a button (on a mac it does nothing number lock is always on on the keypad)  3. Additional "Backspace" button is awkward for use with one hand.  4. "Calculator" button(s) (one on the keyboard and one on the keypad) do nothing on a mac.  With Windows 8 they do open a calculator.  Apparently opening the "Calculator" is the only media or application aspect worthy of it's own button according to Microsoft.I'm going to give this another two weeks or so of daily use and am not sure whether I'll return it.  So far it's just a bit of an adjustment.  I really like the smaller profile and elimination of a lot of the bulk of the previous keyboard.Some decisions while making this were just terrible however.  It's not a "drop in" replacement for the MS Natural.  It's not a "space saver."  You lose time if you use any media keys or have want to create your own custom key bindings.It's is a decent looking device and typing on it is a breeze (similar to a mac keyboard or most laptop keyboards).
4,I have had three keyboards now from Microsoft's ergonomic line. I've had the Natural Elite the Natural 4000 and now the Sculpt. I love my Natural Elite and it has been my workhorse for years. I have one at home and one at the office. They're just getting quite old so I've been looking for a replacement before they die.The Natural 4000 is awful. I submitted a strongly negative review previously on amazon. The space bar makes my hands hurt (NOT something I want in an ergonomic keyboard).I have had this Sculpt for a few days now and it has finally been what I'm looking for to replace my old Natural Elite. I am a heavyset person with quite small hands. I am a 65 wpm touch typer and I need a keyboard that I can reach all of the keys without taking my fingers off of the home row.Other reviewers are correct - these are like buttons on a laptop not like an ordinary keyboard. They are quiet and you don't have to press hard to get a response. The space bar is split in half which resolves the issue from the Natural 4000's sticky space bar. It's pretty and looks hi-tech. The magnetic riser is useful but nothing to write home about. The wrist rests are comfortable with a slightly rubbery feel to it. I think it will likely get quite dirty quite quickly but I don't think I'll have a major issue because I'm fastidiously clean about my keyboards. It's a little strange to have the number pad separated from the rest of the keyboard. I think that a magnetic attachment or something like that could be useful to keep them together when desired and separated when desired.The mouse on the other hand is utterly useless. It feels like a huge awkward baseball in my hand. I tried it out but never liked it at all. The battery cover won't stay on either.  I was tempted to treat it like a baseball and hurl a nice curveball.  Just buy the keyboard without the mouse.In summary - this is a good upgrade from the Natural Elite. Skip the Natural 4000 go straight to this and buy your own mouse.
5,Exactly what I needed
5,Executive Summary:Lightweight ergonomic wireless keyboard is comfortable and easy to use for almost any keyboarding task.Full Review:I've been using this board for a couple months now and this is one of the most comfortable keyboards I've ever laid fingers on. The curvature and angle is similar to other Microsoft ergonomic keyboards I've had over the years (various Laser Desktop models can't recall the exact versions) but this keyboard is much lighter with a much smaller footprint so unlike it's bulky predecessors it is actually easy to move it around the desktop or even hold it in your lap! The separate numpad is a pretty slick solution for space utilization ... if you're not doing a lot of numeric inputs you simply move it out of the way and if you need to hammer out a wicked spreadsheet or two simply arrange it wherever you like for a comfortable reach. You could even put the numpad on the *left* side of the keyboard if you wanted to! The key action is smooth and easy no loud clacking or sticking if you don't strike the key dead center. However the compact footprint does not come without some compromises (see Con list below). There is also an ergonomic wireless mouse provided that is comfortable enough for run of the mill mousing effort but I would not recommend it for gaming ... while it has excellent tracking & movement the shape becomes rather uncomfortable in the hand after a while when unleashing a clickstorm of fury on aliens and enemies.Pros:WirelessErgonomic layoutSleek modern styleLightweightCompact footprint for a full-size keyboardSeparate numpadKey feel is superb a touch typist's dream.Ergonomic mouse has excellent (smooth & precise) trackingSingle USB wireless receiver for all 3 componentsCons:Unlit keys means you can't see them in the dark (will someone ever give us an ergonomic wireless board with backlit keys?)Escape and Function keys are really really (really!) tiny (hitting the Esc key is an every-5-second event when using Vi to write code I miss the big blocky Esc keys of yore)Ergonomic mouse may be uncomfortable for some users (and not well suited for gaming)Overall it is a very nice keyboard both beautiful and functional better than any wireless board I've ever used before (small Esc key notwithstanding ... this seems to be a standard design flaw for MS keyboards).
5,This product came shipped in OEM packaging inside of a shipping box. It is original equipment from Microsoft. It has soft-touch keys a form-fitting mouse and syncs with ease. It is just so smooth and nearly quiet. I really adore this set. I have tried and kicked to the curb at least 4 other keyboards prior to this one (both wired and wireless). some came close but did not hit the mark. If you have heard of getting what you paid for then you can expect a bunch from this combination. It's not for everyone but if you desire an ergonomic keyboard mouse and a detached number pad...this is a sure bet.
5,First the disclaimers:  I am not receiving any compensation of any kind for this review.  I am stealthily approaching 68 years old.  I have neuropathy and arthritis issues in my right hand and wrist and have had two carpal tunnel surgeries on each wrist.The keyboard set arrived in a timely manner packaged well.  Unpacked easily.  I was surprised at how sturdily all three components are built.  Plugged in the tiny USB dongle and my ASUS ROG Radeon 5 1700x Windows 10 machine recognized keyboard mouse and numeric keypad correctly. Everything worked perfectly. I also like the "feel" of the keys-not mushy but not like pressing on a rock.  Really nice.  So that's the upside-well made hardware and software that just works.  Life doesn't get any better than that.I bought this keyboard/mouse combo hoping that it's split design would be easier to use and less painful than standard.  Didn't work out that way.I could not learn to use the split wave design.  I've been using this keyboard for a few months now and have not been able to accomodate the differences in layout from a standard keyboard.  If I'm not watching my hands fingers tend to go to the wrong keys.  My guess is that 50+ years of muscle memory isn't going to be overcome any time soon.The mouse is an odd shape-like a baseball cut in half.  It fit my hand perfectly. Comfortable buttons right under my fingers and just the right amount of force needed to operate them.  The problem is that the mouse is tall and bends my wrist upwards. That's painful.The keyboard doesn't have a numeric keypad. It's a separate piece. I do a lot of numerics use the keypad constantly and the ability to place the keypad exactly where I want it on my desk is a huge plus.To sum up everything this is a quality product and well deserves the five stars I gave it.  I believe it is certainly worth it's cost and I have no doubt it will provide years of service-for someone else.  I really did want this to work but it's just not going to work for me.
3,Edit (2018-09-19): Keyboard is starting to fail sending keystrokes that aren't what I type (space when I press 'c' '\' when I press './' in sequence). The "side" button on the mouse failed a little over a year ago staying pressed all the time and greatly confusing my machine (I don't ever use the button normally). I took it apart and removed the blue button cover and that seems to have helped. I own two sets of the keyboard/mouse. Neither product is really built to last more than a few years.Edit (2015-01-29): The clicking action on the primary mouse button stopped working reliably. That is the audible click no longer triggers at the same time as the mouse click action. This is undeniably a primary feature of a mouse so I'm taking off a star for reliability. The keyboard is still working great though.Solid ergo keyboard -- I prefer it over the 4000 and 6000 series. I'm a software engineer and I've had it for more than 6 months at work.Pros:* It's like typing on pillows made of angel feathers* Split design and angle of the keyboard works well. I have huge hands and they haven't complained at all yet.* I was originally terrified of a wireless mouse but this one actually works. The angle is actually quite comfortable on my wrist and it now feels strange when I switch back to normal mice. Battery life isn't bad at 3-4 months. And the scroll wheel doesn't glitch.* A split spacebar! Finally! About time they fixed this (compared to the 4000).* There's an unambiguous physical switch to change from F-keys to media buttons.* No issues with wireless reception so far.* Spiffy magnetic battery covers.Meh:* As others have noted no LEDs for caps lock/ num lock/ scroll lock. I've repurposed caps lock as ctrl so it's a non-issue.* I use the numpad often. And it works fine. But the fact that it's wireless just means that it gets knocked around my desk all the time.* The windows button on top of the mouse is unintuitive to press and has no feedback. But I only use the side button and it's much better.* I don't need a dedicated calculator button above the delete key.* Glossy finish isn't my first choice.Cons:* The home/end/pgup/pgdn keys are all in a vertical row. After 6 months of acclimating myself to the keyboard I still mash pgup when I mean to hit end. They're nearly impossible to tell apart. I would gladly exchange an extra half-inch of keyboard width for a normal arrangement of these keys. I've worked around it somewhat by sticking some tape to the 'end' key to give it some definition.* The function keys have very little travel and it's difficult to feel if a press has registered. Also there's no definition between the groups of keys (though this is the case on most keyboards these days). What happened to putting the keys in groups of 4 so you can tell them apart?
5,Ordered this to replace a Microsoft ergonomic keyboard I had for many years.  The same model I had was too expensive to replace so I bought this one.It is a nice keyboard and I have no issues with using it. The only problem is that if you don't turn it off when you are not using it the batteries will continue to discharge and die. Had to use four sets of batteries so far. So I have to train myself to turn it off when not in use.
4,I also own the Microsoft Natural Keyboard 4000 along with the Sculpt keyboard.  There are some things I like about this keyboard better than the 4000 and there are some things I like about the 4000 better than this one.Things I like about the Sculpt keyboard better than the 4000:(1) The Sculpt keyboard has a separate number pad so I don't need to reach to the farther end of my keyboard pullout tray for my mouse.(2) It is less bulky than the 4000.(3) It is wireless.(4) The mouse is very good.  You can just rest your thumb on the groove of the mouse so you don't have to grip your mouse tightly with your thumb.Things I like about the 4000 better than the Sculpt keyboard:(1) The keys are too shallow for the Sculpt keyboard.  I have been so used to depressing the keys all the way down for the past three decades of typing that I find the Sculpt keys tiresome.  In fact my fingers get tired more easily since I can't punch the keys all the way down and use the bounce to move from one key to another.  (Typing is like playing the piano in some ways. Imagine slashing the "depth" of all the keys on the piano by half.)(2) I find myself hitting the wrong keys especially when it comes to "backspace" and "shift" keys to the right of the keyboard.I ended up going back to my 4000 while using the Sculpt mouse along with it.  I don't want to give it 3 stars since there are some nice things about the Sculpt keyboard.  And if you are already used to keyboards with "shallow" keys then it might well be a good fit for you.  The 4000 just presents a better typing experience for me.I hope this helps.I don't know if Microsoft designers would ever read these reviews.  In my view you guys should offer a wireless version of the 4000 with a separate number pad.  That would have been perfect.
2,The usb dongle is defectively delicate and irreplaceable. Don't keep it plugged in when moving your laptop unplug it and store it. One minor bonk on the dongle against a table or something and its done. Microsoft will make you go through an hours-long rigamarole restarting your computer reinstalling your drivers testing it on a different device etc before they will replace the set. The ergonomics are so great however that I bought it again but this time with a 4 year protection plan that will hopefully not also make me go through a rigamarole. I might also try to protect the dongle by wrapping it in duct tape or something.
4,The keyboard experience itself is very very good.  Key depth is like that of a laptop short and quiet stroke it's very nice.  The ergonomics of the keyboard is also very nice coming from the 4000 the spacing is juuuust a little different where it is going to take me a bit to get completely used to it but it's not a radical change.  I use a gaming mouse so the mouse is a non-factor for me but it does feel good and if I were to use just a two-button clicker this would be fine.My complaints come in more with some of the design choices they made.  I don't know why the number pad is separate.  I'm sure there are people that love this I just find it as another loose item on my desk to keep track of along with another battery to worry about.  I also don't like the function toggle why they couldn't have added the extra row of keys is beyond me.  i honestly don't use the F-keys that often so it's hardly a deal-breaker it's just something I don't like.All in all I can already tell I am going to love typing on this keyboard once I get a little more used to it.  It's extremely comfortable and the key action is very crisp.  This one is for the office I will be ordering another for at home before too long.*****update after a few months of useNow that I've gotten use to it I can't stand typing on other keyboards even the 4000 (which got relegated to my kids computer) feels terribly mushy compared to this.  It just feels good typing on this thing.  I may even begin my memoirs.Also the number pad totally makes sense to me now.  Having it on the outside of my mouse is much more convenient (most of the time).Happy with the purchase bought one for home one for work.  This will be my keyboard for a loong time.
4,I have always preferred ergonomic keyboards. Unfortunately for Mac users there hasn't been a huge selection available. The first ergonomic keyboard I had for a Mac was an Adesso Tru Form keyboard with an ADB port (remember those??). But as technology advanced it seemed ergonomic keyboards got more expensive and were harder to find. The last ergonomic keyboard I had was a  Microsoft Natural Elite but it was wired and bulky.I saw the Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop in a local office supply store and was very impressed with the design (except for the crazy mouse of course). The keyboard and numeric keypad were sleek and a few seconds typing on the keyboard and it was much better than a standard layout keyboard like the Mac laptop or bluetooth keyboard.I've been typing on the Microsoft Sculpt for a month now and it's comfortable and I can type much faster (or it seems that way). Overall I love the keyboard but it's not without a couple flaws...The Palm RestThe palm rest on the keyboard is a squishy soft material but for some reason it collects EVERY speck of ANYTHING. After a couple days it looks pretty nasty. It's fairly easy to clean with a wet wash cloth but whatever you do don't try to use a paper towel.The Mouse... ??I don't understand the mouse. I wouldn't have bought the set that came with the mouse if it weren't cheaper on Amazon. I have been trying to use the mouse for a month now and it's still weird. I am pretty sure I'll be buying a Logitech Wireless Performance Mouse to replace it... those are amazing.Overall it's a great keyboard / mouse combo and if you can score the set with the mouse for less get it. If not you might want to just get the set without the mouse...
5,I have been a fan of the Microsoft ergonomic keyboards since their first one. This is an excellent addition to that line. This is definitely a bit smaller and more compact than previous models and the keys have a different feel but it doesn't feel like less just simpler and more elegant. It has a less is more efficiency and feel.The quality is excellent and it has some very nice design touches. Even the packaging has improved. But the most important aspect to me is ergonomics. The keyboard has a very natural position for the hands so they don't cramp. The optional riser attaches magnetically raising the back of the keyboard and facilitates having my arms always in a slightly downward angle over the keyboard. At first glance the mouse's shape seems out of place but after using it for a while I notice my mouse hand under less stress. And I absolutely love the fact that the number pad is separate allowing me to place it above my mouse so I don't have to stretch to reach the mouse. I don't use the number pad much and it is much better out of the way. But because it is separate you can put it anywhere that makes sense.I use this keyboard on Windows 7 and 8 Linux and OS X. The only slight twist is on OS X (mountain lion). Everything worked out of the box with the windows key acting as the apple command key but this puts the command and option (alt) keys in a slightly different position than an apple keyboard. It is not hard to get used to. On occasion I get a slight lag running on OS X while it us doing some other processing. I think this is an issue with the apple driver or USB stack. A dedicated driver would be a nice improvement.One thing to note was that my older KVM didn't recognize the mouse when I put the wireless usb receiver in its dedicated keyboard port as it did with my previous keyboard. This port listened for hotkey sequences to control the KVM. I had to put the receiver in the KVM's shared USB port and use it's buttons to switch manually. BTW the USB receiver is hidden under mouses battery door for storage when not in use (nice touch).In my opinion this is the best keyboard out there.
3,I LOVE the keyboard.  Years of classical piano training left my wrists and hands irritable and typing is a constant in my line of work now so I need the split keyboard.  I wanted the wireless too for my new home office.  It was a splurge for the price but it is something I use constantly.  The keyboard is so nice.  If you're chained to the computer like I am and need a more comfortable hand position I say this is worth the cost.  I've had the keyboard for about a month now and have been using it daily.  No problems so far battery is still going strong. Super easy to connect you pretty much unpack it and start typing.The biggest con and it is turning into a BIG one for me is the size of the mouse.  Who thought a mouse the size of a tennis ball would be ergonomic??  If you're a man with large hands the size of the mouse might be comfortable.  But it's so tall (seriously I've been working on all sorts of computers for 20 years and have NEVER seen a mouse this big!) it is aggravating the back of my hand from the position I have to hold my hand in to use the darn thing.  I've never had this issue before.  Put your arm flat on the table and then pull your hand back so it's pointing straight up.  Not comfortable for 8 hours a day.  I'm really irritated that I can't go back to a nice "flat" mouse since everything is paired together in this set.  If I didn't love the keyboard so much I would have chucked the mouse already.The other con is that the numeric pad is separate.  It's nice if you don't need it but I work with numbers constantly.  The keyboard is at a nice height about an inch to two off the desktop.  But the keypad is flat so at least an inch lower than the keyboard.  Not a big deal but it cuts down on typing speed as it's lower and tends to "scoot" away from you while you're working.  I'm a very fast typer and the pads non-static position causes a noticeable slowdown with number entry.  And I have to keep a folded piece of paper under the numeric pad as my wood-plank desk is just shapely enough to cause the light weight numeric pad to rock and wiggle when I'm typing on it.  Mind you my coffee cups don't rock on the desk top but the little pad is so small and light that it does.
3,You poor sod you have concluded (rightfully) that this is the BEST ergonomic keyboard/mouse pair on the market but you own a Mac and you expect things to be Easy. No. This is Microsoft. We are talking a Jewish/Catholic wedding here with some pretty damn conservative parents.Step One: you unbox and peel off this sucker pop the battery cases and yank the tabs and do what you always do: hit the bluetooth button and wait for your mousie/keyboard to pop up. No dice.PERIL #1: THIS IS NOT BLUETOOTH.You will need to re-examine the cryptic pictorial inside the box lid to determine that the secret dongle (goodbye USB port) is hidden within the bowels of the mouse. Plug it in and start playing.Step Two: not quite. You'll need to download the driver from here: [...] and go through a particularly onerous Microsoft install.PERIL #2: MICROSOFT CANT WRITE INSTALLERS.You can find your downloaded installer easily enough but clicking it brings up the nasty message about this being from an unidentified developer (naturally Microsoft can't be bothered to sign this). But you being a smart capable Mac user realize that all you need to do is ctrl-right-click and 'open' the installer then approve the dodgy install with a checkbox. Good to go! Well no.PERIL #3: MICROSOFT REALLY CANT WRITE INSTALLERS.You will now be presented with a second installer screen and upon clicking go will receive ANOTHER message about this being from an unidentified developer. Now you're screwed - there is no way to ctrl-right-click this.At this point if you are like me a near-genius with a master's degree in CS and many years of experience on Mac and difficult marriages you will have the insight to DRAG THE INSTALLER ICON ONTO THE DESKTOP. If you are you however you will at this point be totally stymied and consigned to the oblivion of bouncing between Apple and Microsoft technical non-support until you shoot yourself your dog your children or just send the damn thing back. Except of course that you have discovered this Review which you shall shortly mark Most Helpful. So you DRAG THE INSTALLER ICON ONTO THE DESKTOP and repeat the ctrl-right-click successfully installing the painful installer. Then of course you will be forced to reboot your Mac because:PERIL #4: MICROSOFT REALLY REALLY CANT WRITE INSTALLERS.Finally we move on to Step 3: finding the damn thing you just installed.No it's not in Applications no it's not in Utilities -- it's in the System Preferences under Microsoft Mouse with a hideously ugly pointer icon. Click it and you'll have the option of setting the meager options provided which do not include being able to do anything useful with the top 'windows icon' button or secret thumb button on your Mac so far as I can tell; or re-targeting the 'calculator' buttons on the keypad to say a calculator.But I'll say this: once you finish beating up your pets and family and start actually typing and mousing your wrists are gonna feel a whole lot better.PERIL #5: DONT LOSE THAT DAMN DONGLE.
5,The set is not perfect for everyone but my justification for this still getting five stars is because it's great for someone like me :)If you don't read any further I would say that this is a fantastic set because:1) the curve of the keys and the 'action' on the keys is really comfortable2) the detached num pad allows you to "center" the keyboard and mouse for much better ergonomics3) the natural mouse really is quite comfortable and tracks well because of the "blue track" technology (will track on reflective surfaces)4) this is - in spite of all the flaws listed belowI switched from a wired microsoft ergo comfort keyboard + magic mouse/2-button wired USB logitech mouse combination. The driver for me was because my Macbook Pro only has two USB ports so the dual-wired set up was annoying when I wanted to charge my phone or some other device and the magic mouse was not ideal because several times a day would come loose on my magic mouse and I'd have to go through the hassle of re-seating the AAA battery in the mouse.Minor complaints:1) I dropped the mouse and now I notice that the mouse gets turned off sometimes and I have to go in and re-seat the batteries. At least the magnetic covers make it easy to get the lid off2) No OS X control center so no ability to customize buttons. Only Windows 7 & 8. Mouse thumb button does nothing in OS X for example.3) No off-switch on (infrequently used) num pad4) USB plug-in receiver sticks out enough where I can't "set it and forget it" (unlike the Logitech products)5) No bluetooth option (which is good for us suckers who only have 2 USB ports)6) The set is amongst the most expensive7) The magnetic covers are cool but I spent at least 3 minutes trying to put the cover back on the mouse in reverse. I mean seriously -- why does the printed-side (with all that FCC / copyright / model crap) face INSIDE the mouse? (The keyboard tilt is also magnetically attached which does make things easier)8) My dropped mouse (fell off the keyboard tray) now has a loose piece rattling about and I can't figure out how to get it out
4,2022/05/03after 6 years my keyboard dropped a key. I'll replace it with a keyboard with with interchangeable dongle. I'll miss it's comfortability2019/10/10Yesterday was the day my "start" button on my Sculpt mouse got stuck and make it unusable.My 4 year use balance:Pro:EXTREMELY high comfortability (keyboard and mouse)Very good materials (rubber lasted admirably)I love that its lids are magnetic. Batteries replacements lids.The mouse wheel has left and right click (for scrolling horizontally)Cons:Bad USB-device comm. (having the dongle plugged in the back of my tower under the table would make the mouse and keyboard fail A LOT)I would have expected to last longer. Even though 4 years is respectable time... for this price I expected more.Bought on 2015/12/08 I am extremely happy with its comfortability. So much I am thinking on buying the same model for replacement. It is a pity I would need to use 2 USB ports... but I can live with that.I opened the mouse and unlocked the button I needed to break the start button internally.... the issue was that now every 20 clicks 1 fails... that turns me mad.The keyboard is still working and in perfect shape.
4,Like:- finally proper ergonomic design. I like sits well.- i like separate mouse and keyboard. they do go around the table though ... :D- i like the idea that i can hide the receiver into mouse.- general (big) keys are quite ok to type. nice soft feeling.- calculator on main and small keyboard- clear button on small keyboard (great thing for those using calculator a lot)Not so much:- small keys should be better quality and a little bigger (check thinkpad keyborads - just because key is small does not mean it is less of a quality)- which "GENIUS" designed normal/FN switch (not button). Totally useless. Primary node for me are always Fn keys and using laptop a lot I find it normal that i would press Fn to get all the advance "features". Having switch (not key) that is pretty much useless. Has nobody really used any laptop of those designed to make such a primary school designed mistake?- insert/delete button swapped. Normally keyboards will have insert button above delete one. At least this time they did include INS button compare to some other keyboards where they find it that INS button is not a must anymore...- no backlight (hm...)- separate receiver - good and bad. good - nothing to worry about bad takes a port. on those laptops with only 3 or even two having one dedicated just for that... ON the other hand three devices for one usb port.- i like the mouse but i don't put the thumb on place i am support. However overall compare to some other MS mouses where my hand actually start hurting after 5 min of usage i can use this one for a long time.Overall solid keyboard typing good enough some misses in design (again)... Recommended for those "collecting" ergonomic keyboards.
4,I really like this keyboard but there are some MAJOR flaws.First the good: it's small light and fits in my bag.  It's only marginally wider than my comparatively small work laptop and this is one of the three main reasons I bought it (the others being that it was wireless and ergonomic).  I actually got used ot it a great deal faster than I feared (having used the Microsoft 4000 for like the past 10 years.)  The mouse I was really worried about because I don't normally use a mouse that large but it wasn't any problem and it's kind of nice being able to move the individual pieces around the workspace as I need or don't need them.Now the bad: The mouse has a power off button.  NOTHING ELSE DOES.  And while it's very easy to pop both the mouse and keyboard battery compartment covers off (they're magnetized) the keypad battery compartment must be UNSCREWED and even if you do that you still have to practically pry the compartment cover off which makes me afraid that it's going to break.  On top of all that while the mouse (AA) and keyboard (AAA) use standard sized batteries the keypad uses a difficult to find and expensive CR2430 watch battery which lasts about a day if you don't take it out.  And you can't do that without fearing you're going to break the compartment cover (my colleague eventually decided to not bother using his number pad at all for this very reason).Also: this isn't an issue for me but this is DECIDEDLY a mouse for right handed users.  If you use your mouse left-handed or alternate you're going to find this very uncomfortable.If it had power off buttons on the keyboard & number pad I'd have given it 5 stars.
4,I bought these after trying them out on display in a store. I still haven't gotten used to the layout entirely and I wish they had made duplicate y and b keys instead of giant t and n keys because I'll hit those with either hand on a conventional keyboard. Otherwise they feel pretty good typing feels really soft and it's easy on the wrists. It's also relatively quiet compared to a lot of other keyboards out there though it could be a bit quieter. I'm personally not a fan of clicky loud keyboards and this is definitely the other kind.There are some other small issues with key placement that'll take some time to get used to but my only real complaint about this setup is that it will randomly lag. Both the keyboard and the mouse will go into these temporary states where they stutter and miss keystrokes for a few seconds. So far it's always cleared up after waiting a bit but I hope it doesn't get any worse or it may render this setup too fickle to use.The mouse is an odd one for sure but after spending some time with it I like the support and the shape. It seems to work just fine with all the features you'd expect and good response time. One complaint is that the rounded bottom makes the mouse susceptible to being rolled over to one side more easily than any other mouse I've used which will cause the laser to lose contact with the surface. Also unlike the keyboard the mouse is actually surprisingly loud and clicky.. but not terribly so.Overall though I do feel like I'm spoiling myself whenever i use these items because of how comfortable they feel and I'm not convinced I could have found a better setup in this price range.
4,This replaced an original Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard that finally succumbed a few months after getting doused in water. Still getting used to the totally different feel but so far it seems great. The tilt-forward stage of keyboard they went through was a huge backward step but this seems like it will actually be ergonomically better than before and the mouse is great ergonomically also.A couple of things that maybe someone at Microsoft will pay attention to in order to get 5 stars next time :-)- The dongle is too big. I was expecting something more like the size of the Logitech unifying receiver. If I was planning to use this much with the laptop out of its cradle this would have made it a no-go for me. With the Logitech receiver I would just leave it in my laptop USB slot but this is not an option with this one.- The mouse "Windows" button is pointless and should be programmable via the MS driver. I'd map it to FORWARD (to match the BACK button).- The right function keys should line up with the numbers like they do on the left (F8 over 8 F12 over =). There's no need for a calculator button on the main keyboard since it's on the number keyboard so remove that key and shift the Fn keys over. While you're at it it would be better to move the Fn key select switch to be next to the Fn keys themselves (i.e. next to F12 or F7 if you want it to be on an edge).- Their smaller size is actually fine but the function keys do seem a bit flimsy. I'll withhold judgment for now but reserve the right to complain if they fail. :-)Other than that it's a home run as long as you're using it for desktop use.
5,I have been a fan of "split" ergonomic keyboards ever since they came out and I've owned a number of Microsoft's styles.  This is the best keyboard ever bar none.  I really like the detached numeric keypad.  Very convenient.  The key action and the keyboard angle is perfect. Very comfortable makes typing easier and faster.
4,I bought this to replace a Kinesis keyboard that my office mate declared to be "too loud".  The reviews on the keyboard were good so I took the chance.  I use this on a KVM with both a Mac and PC machine so that was a concern initially. However the USB dongle worked just fine in the KVM and I was able to switch seamlessly and get good results. To my delight the Windows key worked as the Command key on the Mac.I also like the separate number pad which some reviews said would not work with the Mac (it does).  The keypad is handy and I find that I use it when I have any significant numbers to type.  The mouse is pretty good though it needs a Mac driver to program it.  Overall the mouse took some getting used to  but I like it better than my old Logitech mouse.The biggest downside on this product is the placement of the "6" key which is on the right hand not the left and the size and placement of the enter key.  The 6 should be on the right hand in my experience and it throws me off though I'm getting used to it.  As for the "enter" key one of the great things about the Kinesis keyboard is that they put it on the thumb (along with delete and space) as it is frequently hit and it is better ergonomically to hit with the thumb than the much weaker little finger.  I hope Microsoft will make that switch.In the end I like the Kinesis better except for the noise cost and the fact that it is corded.  But while I give the Kinesis a 9 (lose 1 point for noise) this is an 8.5.
5,I bought this when I started a desk job 10 months ago. I had just finished my degree and with all the writing on my notebook my final semester my wrists had started to have a general soreness all the time. I knew I needed a more ergonomic keyboard and found this one- it's light and thin unlike most ergonomic keyboards it looks good like most of them don't and It's wireless which few are. I also like that I can reposition the number pad from the keyboard itself which I didn't expect. The action is very similar to your typical notebook keyboard. (one notable exception is that the function keys are clicky buttons rather than keyswitches. This includes the esc key that I hit hundreds of times a day. I wish they were standard key switches but it's a minor quibble). Finally I don't like that there is no CAPS lock light. For most people this won't be an issue but I often do engineering drawings that require all-caps and it would be really nice to be able to make a quick glance and know when I need to switch to one or the other.The mouse takes some getting used to; it's a lot heavier than most and it's weird to get used to an ergo-mouse. But I've come to love it as well. No more wrist pain and it tracks really well on my desk which isn't glass but doesn't have a ton of texture either.The batteries lasted 8 months in the mouse and the keyboard hasn't died yet. (I do a lot of work away from my desk so I use the keyboard and mouse about 5-6 hours a day.) The wrist-rest has held up really well and though it gets dirty quickly it cleans easily with just about anything including straight water.This is the premier ergonomic desktop on the market right now. It's a premium product with nice touches like pre-installed batteries with only a tab to remove and solid magnetic latches on all the battery covers and removable tilt piece. It's not the cheapest ergonomic desktop on the market but it's the only one I'd recommend or consider.
4,This setup is very good.  I began developing some minor constant pain in my hand that I believe was carpal tunnel.  The pain had to have been caused by using cheap non-ergonomic equipment because it is already gone from using this setup.  I've had this equipment for only about 10 days so I can't speak to the battery life or longevity yet but I know my hand no longer hurts.  I sit behind a computer 8 hours a day and use a keyboard and mouse extensively.The setup feels very comfortable the quality is top notch compared to the $30-40 setups I'm used to using.  I use the keyboard with the included (and optional) wrist pad elevation piece (can't remember the technical name of it).  The mouse is particularly comfortable.  It is a bit funny looking because it is so large compared to what I used to use but it really supports your palm when in use.When reading reviews on this product I didn't particularly like the fact that if the dongle/receiver is lost or broken then the keyboard and mouse are rendered useless.  However I am using the product in a desktop and never remove the receiver so I didn't feel as though that drawback would affect my use of the equipment.The ONLY reason I can't give this setup 5 stars is because the "0" key on the separate keypad sticks a bit and sometimes doesn't capture the key stroke.  Unfortunately for me I use the key pad (and "0" key) extensively and it hurts productivity to have to check and make sure the stroke was captured.  I tried mashing it down with a little force to see if it was just loose from the factory or something but that didn't help.
4,All in all a good solution for those interested in a Ergo keyboard that is comfortable but does not take up much space.  There are 3 components to the keyboard set which I will review:KeyboardPros: Comfortable relatively small (as compared to other ergo keyboards) mainly due to the fact that the number pad is separated light.Cons: More of a personal preference but the keys could have a bit more feedback.  The feedback is very similar to the chicklet style keyboards on laptops these days. Somewhat annoying to have to change the switch for the FN buttons.The forward leaning stand is magnetic which makes it very easy to pull on and off.  However given that a user will hardly ever pull it on and off it's more a gimmick than anything once determining what is comfortable.  The wrist pad is relatively comfortable and has about a 1/4 inch give. Note that the material is a dust magnet.MouseAgain personal preference but the round mouse is a bit awkward overall.  While it may be comfortable for some I simply do not find it that comfortable to leave my hand in a ball shape even without a mouse.  Maybe it's comfortable for those that have their hand on the mouse for an extended period of time but my job requires more typing than scrolling. The thumb button is simply not positioned very well (recessed) and takes some effort to push.  The windows button is relatively useless and the side scroll is difficult to use when you position your hand the way that the product is intended for.Number padThe number pad is pretty useful being separate and having a dedicated calculator app launch button.
3,after weeks of using the sculpt keyboard i happened to use the macbook's keyboard and noticed that it's harder to press on the keys. it's obvious that i've gotten used to the sculpt's very responsive keys. so far i'm loving the sculpt keyboard except for one major flaw the upper row keys including escape and function keys. i hate the way they respond so i'm knocking off a star.i'm a heavy heavy user of the keyboard. as a developer i am on the computer at least 10 hours a work day. hitting esc and func keys are very common for me and the lack of responsiveness on those keys is quite annoying.i had been using the old ergonomic keyboard for many years and went through several of them. as for that keyboard it was perfect and not a thing was wrong with it. i was able to hit any key on the old keyboard without looking not so much with the sculpt keyboard.microsoft please fix the upper keys to use the same mechanics as the other keys. it looks like many others are complaining about this as well.as for the mouse it feels a little bulky but i'll continue using it since it's also wireless. i do think about going back to my razer mouse from time to time though.UPDATEThe keyboard and mouse set is still working like a champ. 10 hours a week day for 2 straight years!My gripe with the function or upper row keys still stands. The mouse is showing a lot of wear on the thumb pad but the wear actually does not hinder functionality. Great battery life on both. I was hoping for Microsoft to have developed a new version by now.ANOTHER UPDATEKnocking off a star..I left the transceiver in the USB port of my laptop and it somehow got damaged in the laptop compartment of my backpack although I can't identify anything visibly wrong. I even tried to oven method found on YouTube without luck.I assumed this would just cost me the price of the transceiver only to find out I need to throw away my perfectly working keyboard and mouse because Microsoft does not offer an option to just replace the transceiver. Since I like the keyboard/mouse I just ended up purchasing another. This time I'm keeping the transceiver plugged into the monitor so it never gets damaged.
4,I like the ergonomics.  I don't like that the dongle cannot be stored within the keyboard or mouse.  In addition I have learned that the dongle is irrepaceable if lost.
4,To give some perspective I am a software engineer. I type for a living so a good keyboard is a must. I'm currently typing this review on the Sculpt keyboard. My normal keyboard for work is a Kinesis Freestyle 2 - so my standards are pretty high.What I like:- I'm generally fond of a split keyboard and the sculpt seems to have the split geometry pretty close to correct. Personally I like a bit more of an angle in the split V but I think that I'm a bit extreme and most users will find the position quite natural.- The keys have a very small stroke so my fingers don't have to travel as far for typing.- The keys are ample in size I don't find myself missing keystrokes- There is a nice magnetically attached base that allows me to type from a standing position.- The quality seems nice and the look is attractive.What I'm not as fond of;- The mouse is ok but not as great as other ergonomic mouse that I have used. It feels a bit small in my hand - forcing me to cup my hand a bit more than I like. I'm 5'9" and have average hands for my size.- The keys have a bit more feedback resistance than I like. It certainly feels Apple-ish but not quite as soft to the touch. It feels like the old Apple II keyboard to me.- The wrist guard I can already tell is going to get oily from constant skin resting against it over time. I don't see a convenient way to swap it out.
1,[Update 19 May 2014]Third time was the charm I guess. I finally received a nominally working keyboard (though the left Alt key has been a bit "crunchy" now and again. I'll have to keep a close eye on it).I intend to use the keyboard heavily for the next week or so before handing it over to my wife. I'll update this review again at the end of that period.My initial impression having used the keyboard over the weekend and this morning is "missed it by *that* much".The main keyboard has decent feel: better that any rubber dome keyboard I've used and better than most laptop keyboards (which makes sense since the keys are the same scissors key switches used for laptops). My ThinkPads' keyboards feel better but I'd place these as very comparable to current Apple keyboards. The function keys however are atrocious. Only time will tell if I get used to them but so far it's not looking good.The wrist rest is not nearly as comfortable as the one on the MS Natural 4000 due primarily to the lack of padding right at the edge and a profile that places much of the pressure at that point. I'm trying to limit my use of the pad as I do with my standard mechanical keyboards but something about this keyboard encourages me to use it. I might be muscle memory from the 4000 as it had (for me) a perfect profile to allow me to just drape my hands on the keyboard with no pressure points at all. Pitty they couldn't have kept the overall form of the 4000 simply cutting off the ten key and adding the improved key switches.[Original review]Well that's two strikes.After briefly borrowing a Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop from a friend at work (just to see if the pathetic Fn & Esc keys were absolute deal  breakers) I ordered one up for my wife intending to use it myself for a week or two to see if it would work for me.When I received my order the keyboard was DOA. No matter what I did no keystrokes were registered. The mouse worked fine so the USB dongle wasn't dead -- just the keyboard.As usual Amazon came through with a quick and painless exchange and I received my second MSED a couple days later.I didn't bother removing the protective stickers from that unit at first; I simply pulled the battery saver tag inserted the USB dongle and gave the keyboard a try. On the up side it *did* register key strokes. On the down side the 'T' key was stuck. It wouldn't depress at all. I applied slow pressure and eventually it did register but it was unreliable. If I pressed the key repeatedly it would sometimes depress almost normally other times it would be completely stuck or have very high resistance or 'catch' then drop. In short it was unusable.I don't know if any other keys were also bad -- I stopped looking when it became obvious that the issue with the 'T' key wasn't just a bit of plastic or something from manufacturing that had gotten stuck under the key.I'm not sure at this point if I'm going to give Microsoft one last chance. When I borrowed the unit from my workmate I found the feel of the keyboard to be reasonable though the Fn keys were almost enough to stop me. I am a software developer and use them often when I'm working in an IDE.Worst of all though was the Escape key. When I'm not using an IDE my editor of choice is Vim so I use the Escape key frequently. The tiny Esc "button" on the Sculpt Ergonomic threw me off terribly since it gives almost no feedback when pressed and is so different in feel from the main keys.If you don't need the Fn keys much and have reason to use an ergonomic keyboard you might want to consider this unit since it's one of the least expensive entries into the ergonomic keyboard world. And the only one I'm aware of with scissors key switches (similar to high quality laptop keys).Don't order it unless you feel very lucky though ...
5,Best keyboard I've owned I bought one for work too. I've also owned the microsoft natural keyboard and the logitech solution and various others.  This is by far the nicest and best looking.  I don't do any gaming so can't comment on it's performance for that.  I do type really fast and this seems to keep up with minimal cross-typing errors.  I think it has to do with having just enough distance between keys and enough tactile feedback to time it right.Good:-with the keyboard gone I can have my mouse much closer.-no mouse charging dock taking up space-soft padded wrist rest-just the right amount of tactile feedback and sound in the keys so it's not obnoxious to hear it but you know you are typing.-can angle it down-mouse is large and comfortable and makes is easy  to right-click with your 3rd finger- the paint on the keys seems better than other keyboards my skin does something to paint so perhaps the little stickers they used hold up better-magnetic cover on the mouse is cute less chance you break it and have to throw the thing out- built-in dongle holder in the mouse-my cat seems to find it uncomfortable to sleep onbad:-wish they would eliminate or move some buttons on the right to make the mouse closer and have it be more symmetric.  what is the 'home' and 'end' button for anyway? the arrows could be in the middle.-stupid proprietary dongle how about some bluetooth? I'd rather buy a bluetooth adapter that can be used with other stuff. now I've got to climb under my desk to retrieve the dongle if I want to use the keyboard with my laptop.-please microsoft give this thing a removeable battery that can be charged with a usb port.-function keys could be bigger for programming-gets dusty fast I'm excited to see they are selling this in a light grey now
3,First of all this is a superb keyboard and ten-keypad. Great layout key response very ergonomic. I love this my favorite keyboard ever. But you need to know how Microsoft chose to engineer this product's wireless communications before you commit to it. The keyboard ten-keypad and mouse are permanently paired in the factory. If you wear any part out and then buy just to replace that part you can't ever use the older and newer parts together. You have to buy the set again for an amount that usually is above the individual prices for the keyboard and mouse.I found this out the hard way and had to return the replacement keyboard and reorder the keyboard and mouse. All because of a single broken space bar. Thank goodness I made this purchase through Amazon which engineers *their* return process to minimize the pain points when returning products. I think in the long run a company never goes wrong when engineering in favor of the user for common use cases. Much better this way than making a user feel trapped. In this case Microsoft seems to want to make you buy everything again. Makes me think twice every time I see a cool new Surface device.
4,When my Microsoft Natural Wireless Ergonomic Keyboard 7000 ceased working after 5 years I went searching for a replacement and found that Microsoft had a new ergonomic keyboard and mouse combination Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop which I bought. As with any replacement product there are pluses and minuses. Here are mine:PLUSES:• Nicer touch on the keys akin to the touch you find on newer notebooks.• Lower profile.• Elimination of rarely used “Zoom” key in the middle of keyboard. (This “Zoom” key has been replaced with an open slot.)• Numeric keypad is now detached from keyboard. (This can be a plus or minus depending on your preference. I am growing fonder of the detached numeric keyboard as I use it more.)• Mouse has lower profile than 7000 mouse that feels very comfortable in my hand.MINUSES:• Elimination of row of dedicated keys across the top of the keyboard such as “My Favorites” and sound controls. With Sculpt keyboard you have to choose between “F” keys or keys dedicated to sound controls and other functions. I have liked having both sets of keys available without having to choose between one or the other. (On my 7000 I had each of my labelers assigned to a dedicated number.)• There is no longer a space between the collection of keys—Insert Home Page Up Delete End and Page Down—or up-and-down arrow keys. I have liked having these keys separated from the keyboard letters. (I believe Microsoft could have made the keyboard slightly wider and put space between these keys.)All in all in my experience of having used Microsoft ergonomic keyboards for more than 13 years I believe Microsoft makes the best ergonomic keyboards. I do not want to work without one.
5,I absolutely love this keyboard and mouse and don't think I'll ever go back to a standard layout.  The build and design are absolutely fantastic.  Magnetic everything super clean and modern thin.  For a keyboard it is gorgeous. But you're getting this keyboard to help with wrist pain not for how it looks.  Good news is that for me at least it did wonders for my wrist pain.I'm a Mac user This is built for Windows but with Karabiner I remapped Ctrl Windows and Alt to the Mac equivalents and it works perfectly as if it were a native Mac keyboard.I'm an engineer on my computer 10+ hrs per day writing software amongst other things.  In my early 30s started having onset of carpal tunnel syndrome.  I tried this keyboard along with the Kinesis Freestyle2 for Mac.  Compared to the Kinesis Freestyle this one takes a longer to get used to typing on because the keyboard is warped relative to a normal keyboard while the Kinesis is simply split.  Within a few days however I had it mastered. The keys on this feel great.  I use it on a negative tilt keyboard tray (also comes with a negative tilt magnetic attachment)I preferring it over Kinesis Freestyle because it contours to the natural geometry of your hands.  Humans are curved creatures - the whole idea of a flat keyboard interface seems more like something that was easier to build (or looks simpler on a desk) than something that was ideal for humans to actually use. This keyboard is like a less insane version of the Kinesis Advantage (the super contoured one) and still provides 95% of the ergonomic function. Plus it looks 100X nicer on your desk at home or office.The only thing I would pay extra money for is a back-lit version of it.  If they ever make one I will buy it the day it comes out.  I LOVE this keyboard
5,I've used Microsoft keyboards in the past and have always loved them. A few years ago I moved to the Mac OS environment but I still use Windows OS either as a virtual machine or with boot camp. I wanted a keyboard that was both comfortable to use and will help me with my posture because I'm generally on a computer for 8 to 12 hours at a time and cannot afford to have any problems with my wrists.When I was reviewing this product I was very hesitant to purchase it because I wasn't reading any positive reviews that this set will work with El Capitan. I decided to take a chance and worse case scenario I could always return it if I don't get it to work.I'm glad I took the chance. I received the package today and setup was quite easy. I plugged in the dongle and since my mouse was already powered on it immediately started to work. Once the keyboard was "powered on" I immediately got a prompt to press the key immediately to the right of the left shift key and similarly to the left of the right shift key. After that I was "rocking and rolling". I've been using this keyboard for the last several hours - about half of that time within my Windows 10 virtual machine (running Parallels) and the other half on the host machine - OX X El Capitan - version 10.11.2.There are lots of great reviews here on the keyboard set but I just wanted to report in that it does work. The only other point is that I also have BetterTouchTool install so I could get the back and forward browsing to work with the mouse. Not 100% that it's working consistently but I haven't spent much time configuring the app.I'll continue to keep my fingers crossed that the keyboard set continues to work great over the next few days and weeks and will post an update once I've used it for a while.
4,I've had this keyboard at work for a year and half and I love it. It saved my wrists.  I developed severe soreness in my wrists that wasn't carpal tunnel and was no longer relieved by wearing a wrist brace when typing and using a mouse. It's completely gone as long as I use this keyboard and mouse. (And it comes back if I use a regular or laptop keyboard regularly.)  The keys are very light to push and facilitate quick and accurate typing. The keyboard itself is sturdy.I have two complaints that are small but prevent a 5 star rating (especially for the price). The first is the set up of Function keys and how you toggle between the regular F keys and the other functions rather than having an "Fn" key to hold down to make the Function keys do the alternative function. That's just dumb. Luckily I can usually avoid having to toggle between the two sets of functions.  Also it's weird that the Function keys have a different action than the other keys. I don't know why they did that. Just odd.My second complaint is that the CTRL key sometimes gets stuck in the pressed down position. It won't look stuck pressed down but they keyboard will behave as if its until I press it again. I'm not sure what that's about but it's a disappointment for a $60 to $100 keyboard.Despite these shortcomings the ergonomics and keyboard action make this keyboard well worth it which is why I'm purchasing a second one to use at home.
5,I’ve used this keyboard for years and bought it as gifts because I love it so much.
5,I love this set. I have been using it for a couple of months now.I really like the form factor and how they made the keyboard smaller and separated the number pad which I rarely use. The battery lid and the riser are all magnetic which is cool. It is a very nice upgrade to their previous model. The set looks very nice.The keyboard is really awesome; the keys are easy to press just like a laptop keyboard a high quality one. It is shaped in a way to have the arms in natural curve which is great for typing for extended hours. I feel a huge difference when I use  a regular keyboard after using it. It takes a couple of days to get used to it if you haven't used that kind of keyboards before. The function keys are smaller by design which for most people makes sense but if you have applications that rely on those keys you may need some adjustment. The spacebar is split into two parts which makes pressing it just like any other key. This is an issue with a lot of keyboards a heavy or spacebar not the case here.The mouse need a couple of days to get used to it too. It is shaped differently from the average mouse to have the wrist in vertical position which is more natural. Just like the keyboard I feel  a huge difference when I switch to other ones (mice mouses or whatever you wanna call them)  The tracking is good and precise--I am not a gamer so I cannot comment on using it with games. I like it much however there is a couple of things I don't like about it: the clicking takes more effort than what I would like it too but not too bad or loud and when my hand gets sweaty it sticks a little bit more than other ones I used.The connection to the receiver is solid and never had any issues so far.
5,I like the keepboard and mouse quality. I wish both units are blue tooth not link with usb.
5,I've been using my set for close to 5 years. The mouse died but the keyboard and side keypad are still going. Much much nicer for those of us who have to type all day. Hard to clean though.
3,I really love the ergonomics of the keyboard and mouse but there are serious issues of connectivity.  I had this plugged in behind my iMac which is about 12 inches from my keyboard. The keyboard and mouse would often not be responsive. The number keypad was also spotty. I thought it was defective so i exchanged it. Same problem. Exchanged for third one. Same problem. I plugged the dongle into a USB hub that I keep right next to the keyboard. This works but the number keypad was still spotty until the battery died after less than 3 months of use!Also the keyboard is not meant for apple computers. For example the function keys are pretty limited to basically volume and brightness (and not labled as such) and there's only one Command key (the Windows key) to the left of the space bar. Ergonomics is the most important thing to me so I decided to keep it. I have not yet tried the new Logitech one but I'm seriously considering it now that it's available.Giving this three stars just because it's a nice ergonomic keyboard. If the connectivity worked it would be 4 stars. It would not be 5 stars because the most annoying thing is that the Insert button is so close to the Enter Delete and arrow keys. I keep pressing the Insert key accidentally and then it's so annoying when you're typing and it's deleting everything! I can forgive the lack of Apple functionality because it's a Microsoft keyboard after all so no dings there.
5,I originally bought this mostly for the mouse as my Logitech mouse was starting to just die on me (the 2nd one to do so for no reason). Not happy with how my Logitech mice fared over the years I wanted to give Microsoft's stuff a shot.The first time using the mouse it actually didn't feel hugely different. My hand kind of naturally held it the correct way (there is a right and wrong way to hold the mouse as is in the directions it comes with). It is quite big but as far as ergonomic mice go it's not very big at all. I was concerned at first with the location of the back button but it's actually exactly where my thumb rests on the mouse so I don't have to move it at all to press the button. Super nifty.What shocked me most about this bundle was how comfortable the keyboard is. I haven't had any of the connectivity or durability problems some reviews have talked about. It feels very solidly built and I haven't had any dropped keystrokes. The palm rest is extremely comfortable especially with the riser that elevates the front of the keyboard. The keys are very quiet. The only con about this keyboard for me is the learning curve. I still accidentally type 7 instead of 6 because muscle memory leads me to do that so I do need to concentrate a little bit to type numbers. Without numbers I can touch type just as fast as a typical keyboard and it feels a lot more efficient because the curve of the keyboard allows for less finger movement.All in all I'm really digging this bundle. This was designed for desktops (hence the name) a lot of which don't have bluetooth built in and that's great because I myself don't have bluetooth and I'm sure the battery life improves because of it. I can't really comment on any durability or build issues yet but I'll update this review should anything go wrong.
5,I've been using this keyboard and mouse since it arrived on 12/27/16 and it fits my use perfectly. I work from a home office and got a treadmill desk for Christmas and needed a wireless keyboard so I can move it back and forth between the treadmill side and the keyboard tray on the other half of the desk for when I'm seated. I got so used to a split ergonomic keyboard and had difficulty finding this style in a wireless keyboard.This is low profile enough to fit under the desk when I slide the keyboard tray out of the way. You can use it with or without the very easily magnetic attachable riser to raise the wrist rest; I use it without the riser when on the treadmill and with it when I'm seated so this is a great feature for me. I suppose it is somewhat equivalent to using the legs on traditional keyboards.A large part of my day is spent on the phone with executives and I often type while talking with people (conducting telephone interviews). This keyboard is so much quieter than my old one! Now people don't even know that I'm typing while speaking with them. It did take me a day or two to get used to the keyboard layout since it is a bit different from my old wired ergonomic keyboard.The mouse seemed too big initially but now I really like it.I use the number keypad a lot and having it separate from the keyboard is sometimes not the most convenient. However if it was attached to the keyboard the set up would be too big for my keyboard tray and mouse so it is more of a positive than a negative with the new treadmill desk set up.Overall I am very happy with it and recommend it wholeheartedly. You will especially like it if you are used to using an ergonomic keyboard.
3,On the plus side:The typing experience is wonderful.  The keyboard is the best I've ever typed on.  It feels great and it's very comfortable.The bad:I have had to replace it twice.  The first one took almost two weeks to arrive; the second will be sent more quickly but still up to 6 business days.  Microsoft is making me send two defective keyboards back at my own expense. This seems somewhat unfair since I've already had bad experiences with two keyboards.  (They originally said they would wait to receive the defective ones before sending out the replacement and it took a little discussion to resolve that.)  I realize that this is my personal experience and hopefully most people won't have this problem but it's worth pointing out that if something goes wrong customer support is fairly good but not as good as it should be.The separate numeric keypad is annoying at least for me.  I wish it were fully attached or could be attached for those of us who prefer it to be there when we need it.  As it is I forget where it is or can't reach it and end up entering numbers using the row on top of the keyboard which is slower and less efficient.The dongle is huge.  if you use this with a laptop you must remove it when you put your laptop in a bag.  Otherwise it will get stuck on something or damaged.  I've had other shorter dongles (including on Microsoft products) that you can just leave in there and those are a lot more convenient.  Seems like the choices here are: leave this one on and break it or take it off every time you go anywhere and (potentially) lose it.  As others have noted if you break or lose the dongle they replace the entire set.The mouse is big and heavy but otherwise pretty nice if you're right handed.  I use the mouse with my left hand and that is not possible with this device.  if you are a lefty it probably makes sense to pass on the full set and just get the keyboard.
1,The USB receiver for this product has major durability issues.  I have already gone through two of these sets and both of them stopped working because of the USB receiver.  Unfortunately Microsoft doesn't have a unifying USB receiver like Logitech so when the USB receiver breaks the set is useless.The USB receiver with my latest keyboard started having issues a week or two ago.  It would disconnect periodically and when it did connect it was usually slow and laggy.  I tried a ton of troubleshooting steps on my own (uninstalling USB drivers trying different ports and so on) but it didn't solve this issue.The product was still under the three-year warranty period so I contacted Microsoft to see if I could get a refund.  You would think this would be a fairly straightforward process but Microsoft seems intent on squeezing every last dime out of their customers even at the cost of customer satisfaction.When I tried to invoke the warranty their rep first asked me to try a bunch of annoying troubleshooting steps including plugging the receiver into a different computer.  After around 15-20 minutes we determined that the USB receiver was the problem (even though I knew this going in).Next the rep asked me to take a photo of the set including all accessories.  I had lost the separate number pad during a move and I mentioned that I didn't have it.  Of course this caused a ton of issues.  He mentioned that I couldn't get a replacement within their warranty terms and conditions if I lost the number pad.  I asked him to speak with his supervisor.While I was waiting I contacted Amazon (who was amazing).  I told the rep I was getting the runaround from Microsoft and that the USB receiver wasn't working.  He didn't ask for a photo for me to follow troubleshooting steps or anything else.  He simply trusted what I said and gave me a credit even though the purchase took place over two years ago!  The problem was solved in 5 minutes.  I then left the chat with the Microsoft rep which still had no resolution 45 minutes in.Microsoft is the worst.  Not only do they have a terrible product design with this keyboard (with the single-use receiver) but they're not willing to treat their customers with basic decency if it means they'll lose money.  I won't be buying from them again.
4,Love the keyboard and 10 key pad but the mouse is weird. Doesn't fit the hand well. I know I could have bought this without the mouse and recommend that to most people. Didn't find the mouse ergonomic in any way.
4,I love the keyboard and separate 10-key pad. Keyboard is just the right size and I am able to move it/reposition it as needed.  The mouse is too big for my hand so I don't use it. I love the separate 10-key for lots of rapid number data entry - makes me very efficient. I have purchased 3 over the years - two for work and two at home.  The only reason I needed to buy a second one for work is because I gave one to my coworker!
5,I spend 8 hours a day using a keyboard and after using the Sculpt keyboard for several years now I can't imagine going back to anything else. The tilt has done wonders for my wrist problems and the stand that comes with it is magnetized so it snaps to the bottom of the keyboard easily when I want to change wrist positions for sitting/standing changes.Just as a note for people scrolling/searching for keyfeel: it's *amazing*. I have and still use a mechanical keyboard at home since I only own one Sculpt and I was wary of moving to non-mechanical switches at work. Let me tell you my fears were abated. The Sculpt uses particularly good scissor-switches which are also found in higher-end laptops and also Apple's higher-end keyboards. They have low travel low actuation force a pleant tactile thunk at the bottom of travel are nearly silent and feel WAAAY better than a membrane switch. They aren't even in the same league. I honestly and confidently place them in the same league as mechanical switches just with a different feel for typing.As for gaming on this I have done it a couple times and it's not bad. The keyboards rating for gaming suffers more from the fact that it's a split ergonomic keyboard than from the switches but it's still perfectly serviceable.
4,I really like the keyboard and I'm still using it now two years after purchasing it. The battery life is great and once you get used to the keyboard (there's a slight learning curve) it's really comfortable. I certainly can't say it's the best since there are plenty of other higher quality ergonomic keyboards out there but those can get quite pricey. For the time being I'm fine with this one. As for the mouse... for me it's pretty uncomfortable. My index finger gets fatigued pretty quickly when using it so I just switched it out for the Logitech mouse that came with the WAVE ergonomic keyboard set. On a side note (IMO) that keyboard is no good. It's super bulky and the keys aren't all that sensitive. The ones on this are way easier to use and require little effort to push down. The downside to my current set up is that I'm using two USB ports one for the keyboard and one for the mouse... oh well. Maybe at some point in the future I'll try out one of those fancy totally split keyboards but for now I'm happy with this one.
3,I use my keyboard daily all day.  Much of my data input is numbers.I've been using the 4000 Ergonomic keyboard for years now with absolutely no complaints.  In fact I've gone through about 4 of them.  I bought the Sculpt looking for keys that were a little easier on the fingers.  While I love the feel of the keys of the Sculpt that's about where my appreciation ends.1) PLEASE offer (someday) a version of this keyboard with the number key attached.  OR - better yet - make it "detatchable".  You could even use these fancy new magnets! You could use two-sided tape or something to hold them together but I move my keyboard out of the way often so the detached keypad is kind of a hassle even if I place it right next to the keyboard.2) I use a command often (ALT0149) that I can't use with the standard number keys - so I have to use the number pad.  The programmable keystroke for the play/pause button only allows 1 modifier key and 1 standard key.  So programming that on the standard keyboard isn't an option.3) The ESC and F keys - why aren't they the same size and feel as the other?  I use them all the time.  This is kind of a big deal to me.4) The mouse seems heavy for what it is.  It feels good but I miss the light weight of my Microsoft basic optical mouse.5) Lastly the dang right side spacebar key "misses" about one in 8 presses.  For that reason alone I'm going to have to return it.  Needless to say I'll be replacing it with another 4000.Hopefully someday Microsoft will come out with a 4000 Ergonomic style keyboard with these softer keys!  I was in love with this thing when I opened it up.  Now that I've been using it... not so much.You might love this keyboard if you don't use the ESC key F keys or number keypad on a regular basis.
5,I have struggled with pain in my wrists and realized it was the awkward angle of the traditional flat and straight keyboard. I saw so many positive reviews about this keyboard that I decided to give it a try and in the short period of using it have already felt improvement. It takes a little getting used to in typing since the keys are slightly at a different angle and placement but it wasn’t anything I couldn’t get over in a matter of a few hours.
2,I AM SHOCKED AT THE HIGH PRICE!$120 for this!? No way.I bought the Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Wireless Desktop Keyboard and Mouse in April 2017 for $86.  I am SHOCKED that they now cost $120. This 50% INCREASE IN COST is NOT ACCEPTABLE and is a HUGE turnoff because these keyboards ONLY LAST ABOUT 1 YEAR in my experience. Spending $120 a year for replacement keyboards is unacceptable when mechanical keyboards last nearly forever.Previously I bought the Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard for Business (5KV-00001) in September 2016 for $72. But recent versions of this version of the keyboard have HAD A DEFECT where the right spacebar misses keypresses causing typos.  This was completely unacceptable.  I was about to give up on the Microsoft Sculpt keyboard until the version with a mouse exhibited no such defect.I have bought 5 of these keyboards since June 2015. I love them. They are nearly completely silent. So you can type when people are around you or when you are on a phone call. They have a mechanical chicklet keyboard feel. The ergonomics is great FOR SPEED TYPING - better than the other ergonomic keyboards I have tried. I can type 120+ WPM on this keyboard. You can't easily do that on other ergonomic keyboards. A huge advantage includes the fact that the Microsoft Sculpt is light enough to be placed on your lap when typing and and can easily be transported on backpack.BUT THE HIGH COST IS A DEAL BREAKER SINCE THESE KEYBOARDS ONLY LAST A YEAR in my experience.There are lots of mechanical keyboards that last forever at the price of the Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard.After seeing this cost I started looking for alternatives. I wanted at the very least1) near silent keyboard since I type in front of clients.2) keyboard I can place on my lap - even if mounted to a board3) portability - can carry in backpack.4) mechanical keyboard feel to allow typing at 120+ WPM.So far the best keyboards to replace Microsoft are:1) Apple Wireless Magic Keyboard 2 with mechanical switches for $89 - but only $66 refurbished from Amazon.2) KBParadise V80 TKL Mechanical Keyboard (with Matias Linear Quiet Switches - which were designed for court reporters) from mechanicalkeyboards dot com for $1193) Filco Majestouch 2 TKL Mechanical Keyboard (with Silent Red Cherry MX switches) from mechanicalkeyboards dog com for $139.Microsoft got unbelievably greedy when it raised the price of the ergonomic keyboard to $120. That price is unacceptable because this keyboard is NOT durable. Expect to buy a new one every year. And at this price there are many many viable competitors.Not that the mouse that comes with this keyboard is practically useless. It has really bad ergonomics. It is HUGE. I threw mine away. The keypad is poorly designed because it uses a special battery that wears out over time leaving you with a dead keypad. You have to buy spare batteries. It doesn't use AAA batteries which you can easily stock. I don't use my keypad I simply enter numbers with the keyboard. I primarily bought the package for the keyboard. The keypad and mouse are throwaways - poorly designed. These make the high price of this keyboard even more maddening.AT $80: 4-STARS. HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDAT $120: 2-STARS. NOT RECOMMENDED. Find a more durable keyboard.
5,If you haven't used a split or ergonomic keyboard before this does take getting used to.  But once you get used to it they're great and you'll never go back!  This one works very well.  I'm an IT professional and am on my computer all day long.  I've been using ergonomic split keyboards for years now and can't really go back to a normal keyboard.  I was skeptical of the latest version of the Microsoft split keyboard but after a little getting used to it works like a charm.  I was also worried about the angle of the keyboard.  All of the keyboards I've used in the past had feet to put it at an upward incline.  (I don't like flat keyboards.)  This one has a downward incline.  It took a little getting used to but after a few days it's been good.There are a few negatives that people mentioned in other reviews that I didn't really care about.  Such as the Function key being a hard switch instead of a soft keystroke.  But since I don't use the function keys for mute/unmute brightness etc it's not a big deal to me.  Also the surfaces of the keyboard number pad and mouse are prone to get dirty quick - especially the wrist rest.One final note - the USB adapter is very big comparatively speaking.  It sticks out from the computer by 1/2".  As a result I've already broken one and had to call Microsoft support to get a whole new Desktop.  On the plus side although the support rep made a big deal of telling me that they were "out of stock and not likely to be shipped anytime soon or ever" the new desktop arrived within a couple of weeks without much hassle.
5,It is a very good ergonomic keyboard. Had it for a few months now and I really like it. It is much more ergonomical than the standard keyboards.It takes some time to get used to but when you do it is a dream to type. The separator and tilt make your hands cover separate areas and let you type without raising hands. Due to those factors you will stop cross-hand clicking and naturally start typing faster.Battery life is excellent have it for 7 months and still going strong on the batteries it came with. The wireless signal is strong and USB stick is relatively small.The only drawback I can find; keys are smaller so if you have "hudge farmers fingers" it might not be the best solution for you. However if you have such thick thingers most probably you are not spending enough time with the computer to require an ergonomic keyboard.
4,This keyboard is excellent just as others have said. The key travel feels good it's very quiet (which is huge to me!) and most importantly it just feels good to rest your hands on the wrist padding and type. Takes a minute to get used to separated hands while typing but that's easy. One con here is that the 3rd row of keys slopes away from the hands instead of curling back up like a bowl. What happens then is that hitting Y with the right hand or T with the left hand for example are sometimes jarring as you have to reach for these breaking the flow. I'm getting used to it but. My index fingers' muscle memory from typing on a regular keyboard fall short of these keys and sometimes between the rows. Wish they would have just continued the natural arc back upward toward the hand and not down and away from it in this 3rd row.Mouse is decent. I found the buttons way too easy to click even just resting my fingers on the buttons sometimes made clicks. Or when moving the mouse and naturally gripping the mouse it would click. I use a different mouse that's truly ergonomic being vertical and I LOVE it. Better combination than what ships with this keyboard. If you're not particular you might be ok with this mouse otherwise I would recommend buying just the keyboard and using your own mouse.
3,First - I'm a long time MS7000 user and an accountant.  So the Good with this set is that it has a smaller footprint.  The wrist rest is nice and comfortable the mouse angle is the SAME as the old 7000 set mouse so you hand sits at a thumb up angle.  Which is really good for the wrist.  I like the hole in the middle and the lack of "special" keys across the top.  I never used either that wheel on the keyboard OR the "special" keys.  On my old mouse if I accidentally bumped it the magnifying glass activated.  The new one doesn't do that - nice to see that improvement!.  Also I like how the riser attaches by magnet.  Makes it easy to put on or take off... So why 3 stars?Cons:10-key - BIG problem for us tax/accounting types.  IF you use your 10 key extensively - note that there is NO ergonomic anything for it.  No wedge to raise it inline with the keyboard not attached (good bad mixed on that).  I'm PRAYING that MS listens or reads this and comes up with a design that gives that 10-key just a simple magnetic cradle!  One that will allow that same angle of typing that brings your wrist up.Directional Keys and home/pageup/down etc are placed differently.  But hey I can get used to that.Keys feel closer together - so I'm overshooting the keys at times... but I can get used to that too.Its the 10 key - CAUTION if you use that extensively in your work.  I plan on hanging onto it and building a cradle from wood for it.UPDATE 4/10  its getting worse.  Mouse jumps a lot.  dongle is 6 inches from it so that isn't the issue...  Back to that dang 10 key. It looses numbers - particularly the first number typed.  so if you type 12 it often comes out 2...  this will slow the professional down!!  Really starting to look for a new set!
4,Pretty nice keyboard but a few small issues.I am an old school touch-typist and I spend a lot of time on my keyboard...consequently wearing them out over a period of time.  I went nuts over the first Microsoft ergonomic (sculpted) keyboards that came out 12+? years ago and have been using variations of them since.So when it was time to get a new keyboard I went shopping and settled on this model.The good:  mostly the construction and material choice is first rate -- solid clean nice looking.  Key-touch feels just right to my fingers just the right amount of resistance no wiggle-waggle or annoying clackity-clack sound.  Palm rest is just right in comfort and lift.  Mouse is nice good movement comfortable hand rest.  The palm lift is attached to the keyboard by strong magnets and goes on easily (see also crummy).Meh:  Blue button on the mouse -- not a fan of MS apps so never use it.  Separate number pad -- I thought this would be cool but I am always repositioning it when its time to use.Kinda crummy:  there is a very narrow rubber no-skid strip on the bottom of the palm lift that came off almost immediately and will not go back on.  The keys are a little too close together for my comfort.  The palm lift is attached to the keyboard by strong magnets and comes off with a bump (see also good).Overall:  I like it and thought it was worth the money.
3,I got this keyboard a few days ago and love it. The way things attach magnetically (like the battery covers and the height adjustment) is really a smooth design and it types great. I have been using Microsoft keyboards on Macs for at least 10 years now and have always been a big fan. However I left the transceiver for this at home today and consequently am not typing on it right now while at work so I looked to see if I could get a second transceiver and all evidence seems to suggest that I can't -- and that seems completely bonkers to me.I would give this a 5 star rating without hesitation if it wasn't for the transceiver issue. If you have used Logitech peripherals you realize how behind the times this is (not to mention how oversized the Microsoft one is in comparison). I'm honestly pretty bummed out right now to think that if the transceiver gets damaged (and it sounds like it is pretty easy to damage) in my pocket or lost that the keyboard and mouse becomes a totally waste. Also if you bought this set and have the mouse the transceiver is storable in the mouse but if you are just moving the keyboard you are out of luck.I dream that Microsoft will read this and think "Yea...why in the world would we do that?!? WE ARE SO STUPID BUT BY GOLLY WE CAN CHANGE AND WE WILL MAKE IT RIGHT!!!" and then fix it...You can do it Microsoft I have faith in you. Please let me know when you have made the world right again and I'll update this review to 5 stars like it should be.Update: August 22 2018:This keyboard is still in use and I am still fond of it overall but it has not aged as well as I would have expected. The pad you rest your hands on has come partially un-attached at the edges and I'm obsessive enough for this to bother me. I've considered attempting to fix it but I have not.
3,If I do not use the Numpad at all this should be a five-star product: both the keyboard and the mouse are very comfortable to use. I did adjust my typing behavior (I used to type "B" with my right hand) but that's easily done. Touches are perfect. The sizes and shapes of the keys are nicely designed and I believe there had been lots of researches done behind this. The switch between Fn keys and functional keys (volume settings etc.) are a little inconvenient but I use it mainly for work so the switch is always set to Fn. By the way the mouse fits very well with my hand but I've got long fingers so I don't know it for people with small hands. As such if you do not need the Numpad and you've got decent sized hands this is a top grab.But you know it the Numpad. I work heavily with numbers and the Numpad is a must. It actually worked very well for the first month: great touches and the extra mobility helped a lot. But soon after that I believed it was the 6th week it stopped working. My computer is simply not reacting to anything I'm doing with my numpad while the keyboard is still functioning well. I tried various ways of troubleshooting as advised by Microsoft and yes none of them worked. As a last resort I dismantled the Numpad and found out that the battery has nearly no voltage left down from 3.0V. This is ridiculous for just 6 weeks. I replaced the battery and soon after the voltage drops even though the Numpad did not functioned at all. I believed there must have been a short circuit within that consumes the voltage might be a designing problem. If you search online you might find similar complaints and none got resolved.So yes I like the mobility of the Numpad but at the cost of product life? No never. I'm getting a new keyboard with the Numpad directly attached so that the battery won't mess around.And this is the reason I dropped two stars.
5,I am really loving this keyboard. I really like having the keypad separate as I have a pull out keyboard drawer so there isn't a lot of room for a keyboard and a mouse.  I got the Logitech rollerball mouse so that I could fit this keyboard and a mouse without needing room to roll the mouse around.  What a great combination!  I have just started the typing part of my medical transcription program and I have not felt any cramping in my hands yet.  I did a course years ago and ended up not finishing because of the cramping in my hands and it caused some carpal tunnel symptoms. Now that I know more about ergonomics and how much they can help I thought I'd try again.  Can't guarantee there won't be problems as I continue to do it longer but I can definitely say that this keyboard makes a difference.  I also work from home and am typing a good part of the day.  I'm so happy I tried this keyboard!  I will say that you might have to get used to the placement of a few buttons like backspace and delete but once you get used it it it's great! I do use it with the removable piece in the front to tilt the keyboard down a little in the front.  It seems like this would be odd to tilt this way but it actually helps keep your wrists from bending a little and you don't really notice it when typing.  It causes your wrists and a little of the palms to rest completely on the wrist rest which is very comfortable as you are not having to hold them up at all.
4,Love: I really like the small size and detachable keypad.  The curve of the keyboard is perfect.I really love the scroll wheel in the mouse it can either click or free spin (toggled by clicking the middle mouse button).  I scroll through a lot of text fast with the free spin.Hate: I don't like the very low profile keys.  It's difficult to hit a lot of the keys (e.g. Functions keys End Backspace Delete) without looking at the keyboard.  I'm a computer programmer and it's a hassle I use these keys a lot.  My previous keyboard had function keys in blocks of 4 so it was much easier to feel them out without looking.It also loses points for not registering a keystroke when the key goes down but isn't pushed hard enough. Often I'll push a key it will click down and not register mostly on the function keys.Also pushing the buttons on the mouse requires so little force that if I just rest my finger on the mouse button it clicks.  I can't tell you how often I've shot my (virtual) buddy in the back of the head because of this.  The mouse is supposed to indicate when it's low on battery doesn't work more often than it does (I lose a lot of mice that way).
4,This review is mostly for software developers:Microsoft replaced my keyboard for no charge and I didn't have to return the existing keyboard. ++Microsoft from a LInux User. You should write that down because it doesn't happen often.Good keyboard. The Esc key is kind of small and not the most responsive for Vim users but it's not terrible. The padding near the edge of the palm rest has a hard ridge of plastic just underneath making it kind of uncomfortable to put your weight down. Otherwise it's quite nice to type on and one of the best keyboards I've used.I remapped Caps Lock to be an additional Control. Caps Lock + W/S/X stopped working on W/S/X down events. For example if I tried to close a tab in Chrome with CapsLock+w it would not work unless I released Caps Lock and then promptly release w in that order. Usually I don't lift finger from the control character until after I'm done striking the character key (e.g. closing multiple tabs in Chrome). Doing so is awkward and uncomfortable and can cause the RSI to flare up. Interestingly enough I think this might be a low battery bug. I received a new keyboard from Microsoft and the problem did not exist. When I swapped out the new Duracell batteries in the new keyboard with my Eneloop rechargeables the new keyboard didn't seem to work. I guess they were low. Using the new batteries in each keyboard did not exhibit the problem. I stuck with the new keyboard just in case.
2,I sent this keyboard back after a week or so of solid usage.  For the most part it worked as advertised with a couple of quirks.  In the end though the use of it as-designed was just not for me.  I've used every single Microsoft Natural keyboard from the original one way back in the early 2000's to the 4000 which I've gone back to.  Points worth noting: the USB wireless functionality worked perfectly for me.  Some people do complain about the dongle being fragile - but I left mine plugged into my docking station and never traveled with the thing ever so that really wasn't an issue for me for the week I had it and used it.  I thought I would like the smaller physical footprint of the keyboard the look the feel - turns out I don't really like the look or the feel.  It was comfortable and I could type relatively just fine for the most part on it as long as I just kept it to just text.  But that's not how I type.  I may be a bit of an advanced typist.  I type about 70wpm or so and I use the Ctrl Home End and Delete keys quite frequently.  I also use the function keys from time to time too within Windows for the keyboard shortcuts and the Escape key.  If you function and type as I do within the Windows ecosystem using these keys you'll find the rearrangement of where they are located and how they've been resized in some cases to slow you down.  And the separate number pad I thought I would like this.  But I need the number pad more than I realized as it turns out.  Having it separate was not convenient.  And the idea that I could just stick it elsewhere and free up desktop real estate yeah that didn't happen at all.  So it just turned out to be a nuisance for me and one more thing I going to have to keep batteries around for (watch batter on that number pad by the way).  But the single largest issue I really had with the thing was that it FREQUENTLY after any significant periods inactivity would not register the first key hit.  I'd go to type something for the first time in say 30 seconds of not using it and the word or phrase would be missing the first character.  I probably could have gotten used to the mouse.  The 4000 keyboard has a bundle where it comes with a wireless mouse too of similar shape and size and I did eventually get used to that but I found myself "having to get used to" a lot of things.  And the list got longer and longer and become more and more disappointed with missing the comfortable speed and consistency I used to operate with it was with a touch of sadness that I packed it back up and scheduled my return.  It was too much change for a single generation of keyboard - for me.  And the first button touch not registering...after a week that became a deal breaker.
5,I'm in love.  For years I worked from a portable keyboard and now that I bit the bullet and got this keyboard my hands are so much happier.  They keyboard is very nice.  I will say that the escape and function keys are just little click buttons vs the scissor keys used for the regular keys.  This makes them harder to push.TWO CAUTIONS- If you're an avid ESC user you might want to make sure you're ok with how its implemented.- Another thing is that this keyboard has a little toggle for the function and windows keys.  I never use the function keys so I have it set for them to use my windows 8 keys but if you're flipping between function keys and Windows 8 keys this will drive you nutsPROS- Great implementation handrest shape of keyboard button layout etc.  All wonderful- The mouse is SPECTACULAR.  I'll never go back to any other mouse again.- They keypad is very useful- It has a calculator button that launches a calculator.  I'm finding this very useful (the button is on both the keyboard and numberpad)It only uses one transceiver 2.4ghz to connect everything (If you're using USB 3.0 you might want to make sure that you won't have interference.  I have USB 3.0 devices and find that my range is diminished on my keyboard but it works)The keys feel like a standard apple keyboard.  Silent with a little resistance before they depress.  They're not mechanical but I think they have scissors on them to improve tactile feel.I couldn't be happier.
2,Dear MicrosoftI've gone through 4 of your Sculpt keyboards in the past two years. The keyboard itself is amazing - great layout satisfying key spring. It's even lightweight enough to carry around to the office. I'm a writer and editor so no numpad is a blessing. Combine the Sculpt with my laptop stand and I have an unrivaled ergonomic set-up that allows me to work for 8+ hours without wrist and neck pain. I used to sing the Sculpt's praises to everyone I know but now I just shake my head.Why? Your keyboard is ridiculously easy to break. Here's your deception: the keyboard itself is durable BUT if anything happens to the tiny fingernail-sized USB receiver then I am 100% royally screwed. It's like an achilles heel but on a keyboard.How do I know?I currently have four Sculpt keyboards all in excellent condition all sitting in storage. I can't use them because their corresponding USB receivers are broken.Receiver #1 : lost it in my bag found it a day later no longer works.Receiver #2: round mouse fell out of my bag and broke on hardwood floor. Receiver was inside the mouse at the time and now translates my keystrokes as gibberish. The fall was not even bad it was like a 3 foot drop.Receiver #3: fell on the floor another small drop no longer works.Receiver #4: Bought keyboard #4 on August 3rd. (I'm a slow learner I know.) It's now August 30th - not even a month later. Receiver just stopped working for no apparent reason.:******I RIP my poor wallet.The Sculpt keyboard could have been legendary. You could have had me hoarding them Microsoft but instead you're choosing to make me a lifelong customer in the worst way possible by making me shell out $100 every couple of months because your flimsy plastic receivers break more often than dollar store Christmas ornaments  and can't be replaced.All humans drop things. Such is the life of anyone on the go. At this point Microsoft you're smart enough to make something that won't be destroyed by a 3 foot fall onto hardwood floor. That fragility would not be acceptable for your laptops so why is it acceptable for your hardware?Lastly Microsoft for the LOVE OF GOD why are you applying the soulmate principle to your keyboards by making your USB receivers IRREPLACEABLE? It makes *no* *sense* *whatsoever* that I have to replace my entire keyboard and mouse set because of one tiny broken piece!Please please make a durable and *replaceable* USB receiver for your Sculpt keyboards. I beg you.If you're reading this don't buy this keyboard unless you're:1) Daddy Warbucks OR2) committed to wrapping the usb receiver in cotton and clouds after every use while you prance your way through life on carpeted surfaces exclusively.The Sculpt is a great keyboard but I'm switching to one I like less because I'm not rich enough to spend $100 every time the flimsy USB receiver breaks. In short what a damn shame.
4,I used to use the older natural keyboards in the past then switched back to the standard "bar" keyboards.  To give me better posture I decided to try this kit out.1. The 10-key really comes in handy and it fits right under the middle section of the keyboard when not in use.2. The mouse is fat and very comfortable.  The wheel and buttons also work nicely3. The keyboard has a good feel (not Apple good but good) and I can type pretty fast on it.What I don't like and was a stupid detail missed (aka why I took 1 star away) is that it does not have an Fn key for controlling things like players and volume.  Instead you have a silly switch on the top right that you need to toggle to switch between Function to media keys on the top row of the keyboard.  That was a seriously silly thing to leave out.  Everyone is used to Fn keys and their use with the row of function keys.  the Fn key is also handy for navigation because it is faster then "begin" "end" "top". "bottom".....I have learned to live with this and was never blocked (just annoyed) but even with this "issue" it is still a good keyboard kit for the money.  So far it has been reliable.
5,There are quite a few things to like about this keyboard / mouse combo.1. The wrist pad for the keyboard is very comfortable - softer than most that I've used previously.2. The size of the keyboard suits my hands (usually considered medium for gloves and such) quite well - better than the older MS ergo keyboards which always made me feel like I was stretching to get to the T and Y3. It's nice to have a numerical keypad when you need one but not have to have it take up space on your keyboard tray when you're not using it4. The detachable support under the keyboard gives a satisfying magnetic click when it connects5. Same thing with the battery cover - much nicer than your average plastic-tab-held covers6. The mouse is very round and can be used in a pinch in your left hand (although it's still better for the right it's nice to be able to change it up every once in a while)7. No lag in connecting the keyboard to the computer - I'll chalk that up to not having a bad Bluetooth connection (the way say my Logitech L760 keyboard does)About the only thing I don't like about it is that I need a separate USB transceiver for it.  It's not big but I normally use a Logitech mouse (the Performance MX) and that has its own as well.  Between the two of them I no longer have open USB ports on my Macbook Pro Retina 13 which kinda sucks.  (Yes I could probably get a hub but I would rather just not have ports taken up by these at all.)
3,Expensive but worth it to me. I have problems with carpal tunnel and find a "split" design like this makes all the difference. I've been using the S4000 natural keyboard form Microsoft but find that those buttons are much harder to push than the Sculpt.I especially like that I can take the number pad and leave it out on my desk (I hardly ever use it) and the remaining keyboard fits really well on a slide-out keyboard tray which most "ergonomic" keyboards don't so I can have my keyboard at a lower more comfortable height than the standard-height desk surface. Lower height split / tilted design so I don't' have to bend my wrists and now I can type all day without problems.The mouse is another story. I've tried using it for two weeks to get used to it. I cant' seem to get it at a good angle to avoid bending my wrist. The Microsoft mouse is very slippery so if I angle my keyboard tray far enough to hold this mouse comfortably it slides away by itself. I've put tape on the bottom edges to increase the friction to stop that but then it seems to move too jerkily. I just can't get comfortable with it and it's making my wrist hurt. I'm going back to my Logitech MX.The keyboard is the best but I just can't seem to make the mouse work comfortably for me. That's OK for me I'll just have 2 receivers (one Microsoft and one Logitech) in my docking station but over $100 for just the keyboard is pretty steep which is why I'm only giving this combo a 3. I wish Microsoft sold the keyboard without the mouse but as of now that's not an option. (BTW - the number pad works fine I just don't have room on my keyboard tray for it).BTW - even if you don't have carpal tunnel (yet) you should really get an ergonomic keyboard like this so that you DON'T get it later if you type very much at all. Your hands are worth it.
5,I'm on my 3rd (or 4th?) generation of these sculpt keyboards.  They are excellent and I would have a hard time "going back".  Highly recommend. My only issue is how they age (eventually - my last one lasted 3+ years of daily use).  The wrist-rest and keys will wear down and look a bit dulled mottled and well: scruffy.  Probably true of other keyboards too... but I don't use them!
5,I read the reviews and did some thorough research before buying this product and all the good and bad reviews I found were correct so do your homework too.  I love this design style and probably will never go back to flat tech again.  I felt the difference in my posture on day one and my typing speed is increasing with less typos.Great seller fast shipping well packaged. A+Edit: SIX MONTHS LATER...and I can't stop recommending this.  I am substantially more comfortable typing and didn't realize how uncomfortable I was before. The detached number pad is and outstanding feature.  My only con is that I prefer a trackball mouse.  Since this is my personal preference the item still earns every bit of five stars.  The Microsoft sculpt ergonomic mouse that comes with this keyboard is exceptional and comfortable (the natural angle is superior to standard mouse fit/feel) and for a vast majority of buyers it will definitely exceed their expectations.  Now if Microsoft made a trackball mouse with a sculpt ergonomic natural angle I would buy that without hesitation (HINT TO MICROSOFT).Edit: TWENTY-SEVEN MONTHS LATER...Still going strong.  The 'S' and 'C' key stencils are fading away but all the rest are still clear and legible.  Range and battery life have not degraded at all and I've moved twice.  The number pad and function keys are still as responsive as day one.  Buy this keyboard.I gave up on the mouse (It's just not for me) and I'm shopping for a Vertical Mouse that preferably comes with a trackball or trackpad.
5,It's surprisingly hard to find a keyboard that does not have the 10-key attached to it. The only ones in that camp seem to be the little mini keyboards for tablets. To top it off those keyboards are bluetooth and the reviews have not been stellar for people who try to use the bluetooth keyboards for their laptop.As stated in other reviews the keyboard is very compact. Some don't like the new placement of the page up/down keys. If that's a hard adjustment for you or it's impossible for you to learn something new you should probably stay away from this keyboard.I think it's a slight ergo tip to try to minimize the distance from the mouse and keyboard. Having to reach across the extra 8-10" gap (that you seldom use) for your mouse will start to wear on you over time. Yes some ppl use the 10-key a lot depending on what line of work they're in but probably not more than their mouse.My wife is a CPA and I'm more concerned about the ergo on her desk than the extra reach for her 10-key. If she really needs her 10-key between her keyboard and mouse she can easily place it there.I understand that there mac users may have some keys that are not usable on this set but apple has a beautiful bluetooth keyboard/mouse set that may be more suitable for mac users.I think my raves/gripes about this set are the same as most of the other reviews. I just wanted to add that it's very hard to find a high quality keyboard/mouse combo without the 10-key attached. If that's what you're looking for definitely give this set a shot.
4,I used this similar MS product for a while for work.  It's good to have it.
3,I really liked this keyboard. It did everything I wanted it to and it helped me avoid wrist and arm pain from office work strain.Unfortunately the USB receiver/ dongle started to deteriorate within 1 year of using this keyboard. I might not be tech-savvy but I know enough about wireless keyboards and their entire dependence on the USB receiver. I did my best to keep this baby together but after 2 additional years and some carefully placed electrical tape it finally bit the bullet.Knowing how fragile and important this little thing is Microsoft should have prepared a way to solve these kinds of problems but no. Once this receiver is broken there is NO going back. It's a shame as the mouse and keyboard set was a real gem.If you purchase this item be prepared to leave the USB receiver in whichever computer you first plug it into. It is not designed to be plugged in and out repeatedly and the stress of pulling and pushing will cause the dongle to deteriorate rapidly.You've been warned!
5,I have to admit that this is a radical change in what an ergonomic keyboard usually is.  It has taken some getting used to but I no longer go home with sore wrists and forearms.  I love the dethatched number keys.  It takes up less space on my desk but putting them out of the way until needed.  The mouse took less time getting used to.  The angle goes opposite of what you might expect on the keyboard but it is very natural.
1,I bought this to replace my "Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Desktop 7000" because my transmitter stopped communicating with my keyboard and mouse.  I called Microsoft and they said that they do not sell replacement transmitters;  I would need to purchase a new set.  I opted for an "upgrade".The "Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop" replaced my older equipment.  It looks much sleeker than the last version.  The keyboard and mouse has a smaller profile and the entire set just looks cooler.  Unfortunately the benefits of upgrading stop there:  They separated the 10-key from the keyboard.  After decades of muscle memory I automatically reach over for the 10-key and it isn't there.  I use a keyboard tray and the 10-key pad just falls off because of the angle that I use (forward down slope) so it just sits on my desk until I need to use it which means I have to move my arm off of my ergonomic setup to use the 10-key with my arm wrist in an awkward position.  Terrible feature.The Keyboard has very slow reaction.  I am a fast typist and it misses letters.  When I slow down it's fine but that just makes me less efficient.  When I enter passwords I get a 90% failure rate.  I'm not fat-fingering it either because I can see the same issue on emails and in text editors and when I switch to USB keyboard I do not experience those issues.  I am a programmer and typing accuracy is essential.  This never occurred with my previous "Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Desktop 7000".Mouse is decent but the scrolling wheel changes features on me.  For example I use it to scroll up and down documents/web pages then all of a sudden scrolling changes to "Zoom+" and "Zoom-".  I'm sure that this is driver/software issue because I try clicking different mouse buttons while scrolling to see if that it what causes the issue but I cannot seem to reproduce it... it just happens on its own from time to time (once every few weeks) but it is very irritating.  You can force it to do this by holding down the "Ctrl" button and scrolling but I am not doing that.  It just switches to "Zoom" on its own.  A reboot corrects the issue.Number pad stopped working after a month.  I gave up on it.  I may just need to change the battery.  I haven't tried that yet but I'm not going to invest any more money into this set.  Besides I hated having to reach up on my desk to use it and when I did my wrists hurt at the end of the day and my workday was less efficient.  (EDIT:  7/22/2015 - It was the battery but it still sucks having to move this thing around just use the 10-key.  It would be better if it was attached to the keyboard to avoid any unnecessary stops while working.)This product might be good for kids but not good in a professional environment.  I'm might go back to the "Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Desktop 7000" or go old-school and pickup a Mechanical keyboard with 10-key... I just have to find an ergonomic/split keyboard version.
5,Got this to see if it would be quieter than the keyboard I was using and it was. Now those on Teams calls can stop complaining about my "loud" typing. Having the riser takes a bit of getting used to but feels more natural.The mouse glides with ease and the buttons are also quieter than your usual mouse.Plugged and in was functional in a matter of seconds.
5,Out of all the ergonomic keyboards I've tried this one is the very best.Pros:-Gentle angles relieve stress without a harsh learning curve for typing-Separate 10-key allows you to place the mouse close to the keyboard reducing right hand stress-Mouse is responsive and clean functioning while placing the hand at a 45 degree angle rather than 90 degrees one way or the other-All parts are very light weight but good grip pads on the keyboard and 10-key mean they wont slide around.-Additional feature buttons like a calculator button on the 10-key and a windows button on the mouse make for easy access to logically associated functions and reduce wrist motion.-Keys are tactile yet gentle much like a laptop keyboard reducing finger motion and pressure to maximize comfort-Pressing both space bars at the same time will still only insert one space an important feature for old school touch typists-Build quality is great in line with Microsoft's other office peripherals (which have been catching up with Apple these last few years)Cons:-Wireless design gives false sense of it being portable but transportation is actually quite awkward-The middle mouse button can be difficult to press if you're not paying attention-Mouse may be uncomfortable for people with small hands. (I have large hands and it's perfect I normally have trouble finding mice)Look up professional reviews and read them carefully you'll notice they have a very hard time finding things wrong with this from a strict medical standpoint. I suspect the only reason it gets any negativity is from the big branding of Microsoft.
1,I've been using Microsoft ergonomic keyboards since 1996 and generally have loved them all.  This keyboard looked to be the next logical step in the wonderful ergo series.  Unfortunately it's not even remotely close.First the keyboard has a critical software/bluetooth/firmware flaw.  If you type really fast or use the keyboard for gaming and have a number of keys pressed down or queued up in rapid succession this keyboard will just simply stop responding.  It feels like there is a keyboard buffer that's getting full and when that happens the keyboard just starts beeping at every keypress after the buffer is full.  Queued up keystrokes will flow randomly from the keyboard to the computer over the next 10-20 seconds before it returns to normal.  It's a total deal-breaker and essentially makes this keyboard totally useless.  Include a wired option in the future.Second.  The build quality is simply bad.  I've had multiple keys just pop off the keyboard during regular typing.  The X key and M key are the biggest culprits.Third.  I love the shape of the Sculpt but the rearranging of the del/insert/home/end/pgup/pgdn cluster from previous ergo keyboards is simply unforgivable.  It makes this keyboard feel less like a useful tool and more like converted laptop keybaord where space is at a premium.  Jamming all those keys into a vertical configuration is absolutely terrible.  While the floating numpad is novel I found myself wanting a floating numpad + arrow keys + del/insert/home/end/pgup/pgdn instead.  Otherwise the numpad just sits there being unused.  Making a full size keyboard would be the better option in the future no split numpad no wacky configuration of utility keys.Fourth.  While most of the number and letter keys on the keyboard feel like an Apple "Chicklet" keyboard the ESC and function keys are some kind of mushy off balance mess with very little physical feedback that you've even hit the keys.Fifth.  The wireless keyboard mouse and numpad that ALL require a USB bluetooth dongle and have no embedded wireless of their own.  This is just a joke in this day and age.  Looking at equivalent Apple keyboards and mice they just work via bluetooth without the need for another USB accessory.  Not to mention the issues with the wireless software/hardware/firmware of this keyboard mentioned in my first point above.Finally.  The mouse is just miserably bad.  If a loved one was being held hostage and the only way to free them was to use this mouse your loved one is going to be out of luck.  Nobody will choose to use this mouse over another.  Hand cramps unusable scroll wheel and feedback-less mouse clicks.Overall - this was a HUGE disappointment.  I was very excited about this device but now they I'll definitely be returning it.The ergo line is dead now MS killed it with this.  Hang on to your old keyboards my friends they're all you'll have going forward.
1,What's worse than bad ergonomics? Cursing at your keyboard. I'm seething with anger at this keyboard. I doubt the stress is healthy for me!So I'll start by saying this: if you're not a power user and you simply like to write regular ol' English this is one of my favorite keyboards I've ever typed on.If you on the other hand expect to be able to use any of the following uh "classical" keys without looking well Microsoft clearly didn't give a fig about you:F1-F12Caps LockInsertDeleteHomeEndPage UpPage DownThe Arrow KeysEscapeThis keyboard was clearly designed by someone who thought "nobody uses all those silly 'legacy' keys." As someone who uses these keys regularly this keyboard is virtually unusable and it's a damn shame. Here's why:- No light to indicate whether caps lock or num lock are turned on- Unlike the very well designed key mechanics on the rest of the keyboard the entire top row of keys (escape F1-F12) are made of a different kind of key that feels like pressing a button on a TV remote control.- Unlike traditional keyboards which intentionally group the F1-F12 keys into groups of say 4 so that you can memorize their location by feeling the gaps between groups on this keyboard they are all lumped together and the F12 key is also adjacent to the non-function keys.-The Insert/Delete/Home/End/PageUp/PageDown/Arrow keys have been carelessly thrown into a bizarre cluster that's virtually impossible to use without looking. To paint the picture of how bad it is this is ultimately the reason I'll be returning this product.- The mouse is so tall that I find myself frequently knocking it over as my hand tries to pass over it. To be fair I don't see how Microsoft could have avoided this one it's par for the course with a vertical mouse I suspect- Oh and the number pad...it's perfectly flat. Which this isn't a huge complaint but you'd think they would have angled it up like the regular keyboardBottom line this keyboard sucks for power users programmers or anyone who uses a lot of shortcut keys.UPDATE: So in addition to all my other complaints there seem to be some weird firmware glitches. So currently I cannot press shift+c. Shift works and C works but if I try to type a capital C with either shift key it does not work. Any other letter will work. Similarly I cannot press ALT+F4 -- Alt works F4 works CTRL+F4 works but ALT+F4 does not. I feel like only Microsoft could create such a screw-up as this.UPDATE 2: In addition to the non-mechanical key issues I mentioned in my first update now I'm actually finding that the function keys get physically stuck and I have to wedge them free. What a piece of crap...I've had this keyboard for less than a week!DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.
4,Good combo.  I have had it for a week and so far I have been enjoying it.Size and fit:The keyboard and the mouse fit nicely on my keyboard tray. The detachable numpad is what I need since my keyboard tray is not wide enough to fit a mouse and a full-size keyboard -- the room for mouse cruising becomes rather tight. Without the numpad the combo fits perfectly.Keyboard:I really like the split and the shape. The hands feel very comfy. Nice typing.Big pro: The func key is a mechanical switch. Since I have no use for the special functionality and I use the F1-F12 keys a lot this is cool. On my previous Microsoft keyboard I had to manually configure the func keys through the Microsoft Keyboard and Mouse center for them to always perform as F1-F12  which was a pain. The keyboard profile is relatively low and no extra multimedia keys which I never use.Con: The keyboard came with discharged batteries so I had to replace them. This is a negative point.Mouse:Feels very comfy.Con: The boulder shaped mouse tends to fall off my tray really easily. Luckily I have carpeted floors. So one is star is knocked off.Numpad:Good detachable. Since it has the calculator button I keep it on the desk and use it as a calculator. Handy.All in all I am happy with the purchase.
4,Very easy natural and fast typing. I have been using ergonomic keyboards for 20 years. I have had some favorites in my time and others that are just so so. The typing on this keyboard is great. It feels very natural easy and quick. My only real complaints are the special keys off to the right of the keyboard are a different layout from traditional keyboards and after a year my fingers still can't zoom to these keys on the right. I have to stop what I'm doing and look down to align my fingers. That's my only complain about this keyboard.Oh. For the longest time this keyboard was double typing characters. In help forums most people blamed it on me double tapping the keys. I know when I make a typo. I know I wasn't double tapping the keys. In some case I knew for a fact i didn't because I was making a point to tap them only once and the character would show up more than once on the screen. I tried all sorts of things suggested online to make this problem go away. Now that I am writing this review a year later I can't think of the last time I had this problem. I suspect Microsoft figured out the problem and was able to fix it with a driver update.
4,The keyboard is a nice alternative to the classic ergonomic 4000. It takes up less room on my desk and it's nice to be able to place the numeric keyboard wherever I want. While typing the chiclet keyboard feels a little more cramped than the classic to my medium-sized hands but I imagine I'll be able to get used to that soon. I don't mind the reduced key travel but others might. The place where this really shines is build quality. It is so much more solid than the ergonomic 4000 series - all key strokes feel confident and there isn't any play or creaks like I feel in the bigger more plasticky keyboards I've tried. I also like that they have maintained direct access to the volume play/pause and calculator functions without dedicating a huge amount of space to those. A couple of small issues -  there are no Caps Lock/Num Lock indicators and to toggle between traditional function keys and volume etc it is necessary to flip a switch instead of pressing a function key. That's probably going to frustrate those users who like hitting f5 for refreshing a web page etc. I hate the mouse. It has a better overall feel than some but the more vertical design is extremely uncomfortable to my hands. If you have a mouse you love just stick with that and buy the keyboard-only version.
4,Bought in July of 2020. The scroll quit working on the mouse. Yes I changed batteries checked  the computer with another mouse and they all worked fine.
4,First let me mention the two very best things about this product. The first is the feel of the keyboard in terms of its touch sensitivity. a perfect feel.  Second I very much like the fact that the number pad is completely separate from the keyboard. This optimizes any space issues and it provides maximum versatility.As to the mouse it is excellent as well and was the original reason for my buying this product. It is far superior to any type of standard mouse in terms of preventing repetitive motion problems. (However I subsequently found a vertical mouse I like even better but this one is still a very good one.). One other good feature of this mouse is its ability to work on any surface even e.g. clear lucite.Now as to how they could improve this product and why it didn't get five stars: although the keyboard is elevated at its center the elevation is minimal compared to Microsoft's earlier ergonomic keyboard. That keyboard having a higher raised center section had a better ergonomic angle but the problem was that it had a horrible feel when pushing the keys; it simply took too much effort. The optimal keyboard would keep the best features of this one but add the higher ergonomic angle of the older one.  Also the mouse would be better for reducing wrist and forearm strain if it were even more vertical.
3,I've always used my right index finger for 6. Because this keyboard includes it on the left hand side of the split I had to adjust. Not only would I have to use my left index to press 6 but now all the right hand numbers are shifted over one meaning my right hand pinky has to stretch an incredible amount to hit 0. I guess they assume i'll use a number pad but I hate number pads and can touch type using the numbers in the row above.Furthermore my h key is broken from the factory. for some reason it's unable to depress linearly like the other keys and when i force it it clicks hard in the upper lefthand corner.needless to say I am returning but it's a shame because otherwise the keys are quiet the shape of the keyboard itself is decent the absence of an attached 10-key pad is welcome and i like the aesthetic. the 6 key has consequences for both hands and is a bit of a deal breaker. Returning but I'm not sure what can replace it.
3,For several years I've been using a Microsoft Natural Ergonomic 4000 keyboard and really loved it. But I was very intrigued by the new Sculpt items so I wanted to give them a try.After about a week of use I'm getting the hang of some of the differences between the two items. Here's my feedback from the first week:1. I don't particularly like having the numeric keypad separate. The biggest complaint I have with it is that I use the optional pedestal for the keyboard to raise it up a little bit. The keypad doesn't include one so it's at a different height than the keyboard. That makes it a bit of a pain.2. Overall typing on the keyboard is comfortable. I like the feel of the keys as opposed to my old Natural Ergonomic 4000. The keys are wider in spots which works well.3. The function keys are tiny. That takes some getting used to if you use them frequently for work.4. The mouse is nice. It's bigger and doesn't put a lot of strain on my wrist.Overall this is a pretty nice package. I do wish that the keyboard featured larger function keys and that the numeric keypad were attached. I'm hoping that I get more comfortable with this over time.UPDATE 3/21/15 - Either the keyboard (or software driver) has proven to be extremely buggy. Several times I've found that certain keys or key combinations will not work. I've uninstalled/reinstalled the MS Mouse & Keyboard Center a few times. Sometimes it seemed help other times not.I have finally decided to go back to my Natural Ergonomic 4000 keyboard. At least that one works consistently. As for the mouse I have kept that running as it is pretty comfortable to use.This keyboard has a lot of potential but doesn't seem to be ready for prime time.
5,After the first use of this keyboard/mouse/keypad combo my wrists and hands stopped aching at the end of the day. Highly recommend this set to anyone who does computer work regularly. I have used other/older versions of ergonomic keyboards and none work so well. I find I type more accurately with this keyboard. The shape of the mouse lets your hand fall into a natural position and is very comfortable and easy to use. The detached keypad is nice so you can get it at the right angle for comfort to input numbers.
5,I love it. I am so in love with it that it's a little embarrassing. The key strike is soft but still clicks satisfyingly the design is very comfortable and the wrist wrest is soft and durable. I get compliments on it all the time at work. I originally purchased this keyboard because I have early signs of C.T. and I noticed my arms/wrists/hands seizing up more and more. I thought an ergonomic keyboard would be a help. It's been a bigger help than I imagined. I don't have wrist or elbow fatigue anymore and my hands don't ache at night. The keyboard took about two weeks for me to get accustomed to and return to normal typing speeds. The keys are spaced differently than normal keyboards so you may need to give yourself a little learning time. I am faster on it now than I am on a traditional keyboard. The mouse is also a little strange...I call it the "doughball" because of its round and bulbous shape. I love it just as much as the keyboard. The mouse has smooth action and is very easy to rest on. I would highly recommend this set-up to anyone who works at a desktop. It's a great purchase.Side note - I have had the keyboard and mouse for over a year and haven't had to change a battery yet.
5,I love this set.
5,I was provided this set at a previous job when I started experiencing wrist pain. When I changed jobs I ordered one for my home office for my lap top because I like how it feels. Eliminates any wrist discomfort.
5,I was looking for a wireless alternative to my Natural 4000 which I loved - and also needed to replace a random wireless mouse that would no longer hold a charge. This is pretty much the perfect set for my needs.I was a little unsure of the mouse comfort before I ordered as I'm used to the Logitech ergo styles and this one is a bit more... bulbous? Still amazingly comfortable though. Accuracy and response are just fine for my needs.The detached number pad was also a bit of a concern as I tended to use mine more than occasionally on the 4000. But I find that I hardly use it at all now. It mostly sits in my desk drawer - which is fine because this keyboard takes up so much less room than the 4000 did. I do get the number pad out once in a while if I'm going to get into slightly more serious number things. But that's kind of its beauty. I can put it away when I don't need it - get it out when I do and it works every time.The one thing I do sort of miss from the 4000 are the customizable shortcut buttons on the top row. I knew this one didn't have anything like that though - and like the other concerns I had I find that I like this keyboard far more than the 4000 and don't even care anymore.
2,I wish I’d taken a closer look at this keyboard before I bought it. The number keys on the right side of the keyboard do not line up with the letters below unlike every other keyboard. Eg 7 lines up with U on every other keyboard and 8 lines up with I. So your index finger types 7 and your middle finger types 8. On this keyboard 7 is slightly to the left of U so your index finger lines up in the middle of 7 and 8. And this cascades to every other number so your middle finger falls between 8 and 9 instead of on 8.This might not be a big deal to someone who doesn’t use the number keys often but as a software engineer I am constantly typing the wrong key. I’m going to give myself a bit to get used to it but I’ll probably end up going back to a different keyboard.This gets 2 stars only because the mouse works fine. I can’t understand how something like the keyboard layout could be fundamentally designed so poorly.
5,Fantastic product. Got it in the mail in less than 24 hours with Prime 1-Day shipping... which was great. Packaging is clean and simple. The keyboard itself is beautiful. It is very sleek and modern in design. I love the split "Space" bar. I also love that the number pad is detached it frees up space on you desk which otherwise would have been taken by a larger keyboard. I'm still new to typing with it but so far it is not bad at all. The mouse is a lot different than your standard mice (?) because of how round it is. I don't think it is that big of a deal though and the wireless functionality of the keyboard and mouse makes up for those slightly awkward things.Totally beats the old generation Microsoft ergonomic keyboard I was using.Oh and I am using this will my MacBook Pro. The setup involved turning on the keyboard by removing the little battery tags that come with the packaging and placing the dongle from the mouse (found inside the mouse) in a USB port. A little setup screen popped up on my MacBook Pro I verified the keyboard setup/ country... and that was it. All in all took less than 60 seconds. It was a very easy very quick setup on my 2012 MacBook Pro.Still very new to the product but so far I'm very excited and pleased.
5,Keys are quiet. Keyboard is ergonomic. Very sleek!!
5,Great keyboard. I own two and use it on my iMac 2009 and my MacBook Pro Retina Late 2014. The ergonomics are great. Keypress tension is light but enough to elicit a good tactile response. Before I bought this several years back I was getting stiff fingers and pain in my hands and wrists. After a few days the pain and stiffness went away and I attribute it to this keyboard. YMMV but I can honestly say that if I go a few days of pure laptop with no Sculpt Keyboard the stress and pain comes back. It is a surprisingly handsome and well designed product considering it comes from Microsoft.I did have to return one under warranty after a year to Microsoft due to the capital V no longer working but MS support was great. This might be my fault given I regularly use moist antiu-bacteiral wipes on the keyboard to keep it clean. Maybe a particularly Response time was fast and they paid for the shipping so no complaints. I was just glad to have my keyboard back again.I also highly recommend the Mac app Karabiner to use with this keyboard. [ [...] ] You can remap the Windows buttons on the keyboards and the mouse wheel and buttons too to anything under the sun; even make the remapping specific to individual apps. It completes this keyboard since the keyboard has zero software or drivers for it. Together they are indispensable.
4,The keyboard and number pad are fantastic!  Long battery life (I use mine 8-12hrs/day 5-6 days per week for work) and have yet to change them in almost 6 months of use. The keyboard wrist pad is super comfortable and had held up very well to sweat and debris... did I mention I work out of a barely insulated shed in my back yard?  It's even easily packed for business trips. I love the fact that the keypad is detached as I used to have a Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 but wore the lettering on all the keys off and though I'm a decent typist there are times I just NEED to look.  Excellent replacement with much more flexibility.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the mouse. I did not care for the "ergonomics" of this mouse.  I do CAD work all day and have found that either a track ball mouse or my dedicated CAD mouse reduce my wrist fatigue whereas the mouse that came with this set was awkward to use.  I wish the kit was sold as just the keyboard and number pad.  Those two items are 5 stars if not 6.
5,I recently put together a treadmill desk.  I found that using my regular full size keyboard caused the mouse to be too far to the right to be comfortable and safe when on the treadmill.  This was due to the keypad on the right side of the keyboard.  I tried a couple of compact no keypad keyboards before settling on the Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop.I was not happy with not having a keypad since I use it fairly often.  The Sculpt Desktop lets me put the separate keypad to the right of the mouse where I can reach it when needed.The mouse is excellent.  I previously used an Evoluent Vertical Mouse.  I find the Sculpt to be more comfortable and more responsive.  I've never lost the signal it is very smooth on every surface I've tried it on and even an idea as simple as the magnetic battery cover is wonderful.I've always been a fan of the original IBM keyboards.  I had one of the successors a Unicomp -- big loud and solid.  I was not sure how I would like the keys of the Sculpt Ergonomic keyboard or how I would feel about the ergonomic layout.  The keys themselves have been fine and I'm actually enjoying not hearing all the clacking my previous keyboard made.  The layout took a couple of weeks to get used to but I now type as fast as I did before and typing actually feels more comfortable.
5,Others have and rightly so mentioned the 'prone to show oil' finish on the hand rest.  They are correct.  This keyboard will look awful after about 2 months.  But it's nothing a 'handy wipe' won't correct.  Otherwise this keyboard layout can't be beat.  The raised rear section always you to type lazy and just use your fingers instead of the old school keep your wrist above your fingers.  The split and easy key touch is easy on the wrist and forearms.  It almost feels as close as you can get to holding a basketball (a quality engineering 3 pointer).  The mouse feels good but will likely have you sliding the heel of your hand on the table (I actually have a callus after using it for a few years).  I tried other ergo keyboards but have come back to this one and I'm happy.  I scored this low for battery life not necessarily for the battery but the fob.  If you break the fob you have to start over with a new keyboard/mouse (sucks).
1,I had this keyboard at my place of employment. I had a desktop computer that never left my dek. It was fabulous. I decided to purchase one for my personal use laptop at home. I saw that the dongle was large but tried to always be very careful with it. However after 7 months of good use my laptop was bumped into and the dongle broke off. I spent over a month going back and forth with microsoft support only to find that they will not replace it. You are just out of luck with it. Perfectly good keyboard and mouse going in the trash cause there is no replacement for the dongle. :( $100+ just gone after not even a year of use.
5,This is the most comfortable keyboard I have ever used. I lost the USB transceiver for my previous keyboard -   Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Desktop 7000         and I decided to buy this one as the other ergonomic keyboards I looked at were either too flimsy or not angular enough. I needed to stay wireless as my adjustable standing desk/laptop combination would chew up a wired keyboard.Not surprisingly I found the old transceiver after the Sculpt shipped. I almost sent it back to save a few bucks but decided to open the box to try it out and I'm so glad I did.This keyboard combines the same ergonomic angles of the 7000 and requires a much softer touch to type. I can type much faster and longer with the Sculpt. The separate keypad takes a little bit of getting used to and the mouse is not perfect but is better than a lot I have tried. The BlueTrack technology has rid me of the need for a mousepad.The Good:- Super comfortable- Easy to use- Magnet clasps are really cool- Sleek designThe Not-so-Good- USB transceiver is a big improvement over the Natural Desktop 7000 but is still beat out by the slimness of the Logitech Unifying Receiver- Number Pad ends up making the footprint of this set larger than one would expect from the sleek look of it
5,I had this set in my office for more than 6 years and I love how it works and feels. The design is ergonomic and the disconnected key pad reduces desktop real estate length wise.I just recently purchased another set for my home office because of the COVID-19 working from home restrictions.  I have had multiple LOGIC tech keyboards that are slim but I still had the issue of my hands being too tight to each other. This Microsoft keyboard spreads your hands at a comfortable distance.  The mouse set up is "Non" traditional but it is very comfortable.  Like most things you have to get use to using the keyboard and the mouse but this setup will help reduce fatigue.  It has reduce fatigue in the last 6 years I have had it. I am not a gamer so no stars for that category.I recommend this item.
4,I had been using the Natural Ergonomic keyboard made by Microsoft for years and loved it.  This keyboard is much more comfortable and I do highly recommend it.  The only downside to this keyboard is that it is not rechargeable.  If not rechargeable I would gladly take a wired version of this keyboard.  I am a fan of any device that has lithium batteries in it and if this keyboard had that it would be perfect.  People have complained about the mouse on reviews a lot but I think the mouse's shape is just fine.  The mouse is spherical I would say and this forces your hand into a more natural position.  You don't bend your wrist as much when using this mouse which really does help with wrist pain.  My only suggestions for the mouse is to make the clicking smoother and to allow fast scrolling.  I prefer the Logitech MX Revolution over this mouse since it is lithium powered faster sleeker more buttons included.  I highly recommend that mouse with this keyboard.  Microsoft continues to make the best keyboards I have ever seen.  Now is it worth it to get the mouse with this keyboard?  I say yes simply because it is a much better value.
5,We have only had this item for a week or two so cannot say anything regarding the durability or battery life but so far I am impressed. It is comfortable works well and was easy to set up (it worked right away after plugging in to Windows 10). The key layout takes a little adjusting to but I am used to curved keyboards and this is not much different from my previous keyboard. I am especially impressed with the simple elegance of using magnets for the battery covers and removable wrist support for the keyboard. The wrist support in particular stays in place very well but is also very easy and convenient to remove or put back on as desired because it is held in place with a clever notch and magnet system. It seems like every little detail is similarly convenient well thought out and high quality. Overall I am very happy with this keyboard so far. My only complaint is that I wish one of the shortcut buttons was for putting the computer to sleep like I had on my previous keyboard. I would guess that there is a way to change the default behavior to accomplish this I just haven't spent any time trying to figure it out.
5,I purchased this keyboard and mouse to replace my old wired Microsoft ergonomic keyboard.  It has a comfortable fit and the battery life is good.  I've been using one on my primary workstation for about a year and have not replaced the keyboard battery.  I've replaced the mouse battery once in that time.  I don't use the number pad often but the battery still needed to be replaced after about nine months.  Unlike the mouse and keyboard that use standard batteries (AA and AAA respectively) the number pad uses a watch-style battery.  The mouse is also very comfortable.  I always use it on a mouse pad so I can't comment on how well it works on different surfaces.  I would purchase this again; in fact I purchased a second one of these for use with my laptop when I'm at home.
4,i really like the keyboard its probably the most comfortable ergonomic keyboard i have ever used.  I can still type fast on it (close to 80wpm).  I use it primarily for software development.. like 95% development 4% porn 1% other.I love the calculator button attached so convenient!WHAT I DONT LIKEI thought i was going to like the separate number pad but in reality i can never find it it gets in the way of the mouse and i keep slamming the page down button when i want to hit the enter button on the far right of most normal keyboards.The function keys are too close to the numbers and are more like buttons than keys.  you cant just sweep over and flick them and they're all too close to access without completely focusing your attention on the button.  As a developer i use them all the time and this is annoying.  maybe i can remap shift/ctrl + something for better results.The mouse is also not comfortable.  Part of why i bought the combo was to consolidate my mouse and keyboard into a single usb slot.  Im sure there are other ways to do this but i was hoping the combo would be most streamlined.
3,The mouse lasted 1 year scroll wheel quit working first.  Keyboard lasted 2-1/2 years then died.  I liked the mouse and keyboard but it should have lasted longer than it did.
1,I have CONSTANT Bluetooth lag with my mouse and keyboard. More so the mouse. I have bought two and both had the same issue. did trouble shooting more times that I can remember. The only thing the briefly fixes it is restarting my wifi router(?) - I have no idea why. Thought there was something wrong with the first one and bought another. Turns out they are just crap!Switched to a wired mouse and the problems disappeared. Then I tried the Logitech MX wireless mouse and no problems there. Getting ready to trash sculpt keyboard as well because of the lag.Note I do have a ton of 2.4ghz device running around my office so there might be a lot of interference. Still that isn't an excuse for not providing support and selling a bad product.
5,Overall I am quite impressed by the new design after using both the original Natural Keyboard (from 1990s) and the Natural Keyboard Elite.SetupPlease make sure you install the latest version of Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center on your PC before you connect the mouse and keyboard. My Windows 7 couldn't automatically install the drivers.Remove all the plastic tabs that shield the batteries. Just remember the orientation of the mouse cover when retrieving the USB receiver and it will snap into itself easily.UsageI use the keyboard with the bracket attached. This raises the keyboard and forces you to type with your back straight which is a good thing. The keys are quiet. Although key travel is short it has good feel and much better than laptop keyboards. The cursor keys and the Insert end etc. keys are in different locations from my old keyboard so it will take some time to get used to the locations. The number pad is detached from the main keyboard so you can move it around to suit your need.The mouse is perfect for my relatively short hand. The angle of the mouse allows my right hand to use it in a more natural position. I used to get quite tired when using my Comfort Mouse 3000 for long period doing precision mouse clicking. This mouse is much more comfortable. I find it best to use this mouse without mouse pad. Some mouse pads will put too much drag on the mouse.
2,I am very disappointed to be shopping for another ergonomic keyboard. Keyboards are a very personal choice and some feel right for me and others that get great ratings are uncomfortable. I love the layout and the low profile keys (except that the number pad was separate). It has worked with my Mac very well even when I upgraded to Catalina.One year and 4 months later I am having intermittent connectivity issues. I have tried changing batteries and to figure out if there is something else that could be interfering. Since I have not added any peripherals and I tried removing things from the room I don't think that it is the usual problem with interference for a wireless keyboard. The disconnects are happening more frequently as the days go by.  I now believe it is the keyboard is going out.I'm very disappointed and looking at purchasing a wired keyboard. I don't have the time or patience for my keyboard to go out on me. Now I will have to use my mac keyboard and have sore wrists and forearms until I find one I like. that will likely mean a lot of shipping back and forth. Even if it weren't for the pandemic stores don't usually carry a wide range of ergo keyboards to try.Only buy this if you are looking for something that will last a year. Don't fall in love with it because you will either have to replace it annually or be broken hearted.
4,I love this keyboard. I do transcription from home a few hours a day. It’s smooth and comfortable and alleviates most pain in my wrists etc. it loses 1 star because so far i can only get 2 years out of these boards before they break down. My last one had too many keys pop off to function.
3,I think this is keyboard and mouse combo makes a lot of sense from an ergonomical standpoint which I supposed is its primary purpose . The keyboard not only contours outward but with the base installed it forces your hands to point downward so it does not bend your wrist like most keyboards with a wrist rest. The mouse is also comfortable and make ergonomic sense since forces you to hold it somewhat side ways.The negative are as follows: 1) The key layouts are a bit strange and the keys  are spaced further apart than typical keyboard which would make it suitable for people with large hands but difficult for people with even average sized hands. 2) The keys are built like a laptop keyboard rather than an actual key board thus do not have the tactile feedback of a regular keyboard 3) Having the number key pad separated from the main keyboard makes it awkward and inconvenient for anyone who needs to input numbers frequently.
4,This is my second Microsoft ergonomic keyboard have been using this product at work for almost 5 years now. Had carpal tunnel syndrome due to long hours of coding and this keyboard has definitely helped me. Have not been having wrist pain after starting to use this keyboard.Scope of product improvement: My first Microsoft keyboard is still good but the plastic wireless receiver broke as I have been carrying it to work on a daily basis in a laptop bag. A Logitech wireless receiver was also attached to the same laptop but it is still good. So definitely the quality of the plastic on the wireless receiver must be improved. I would have still been using my first  Microsoft wireless keyboard if the receiver would have been good.Overall  it is an excellent ergonomic keyboard.
5,This keyboard has been a necessity for me. I love the removable 10 key pad. It allows me to type properly and more quickly.
3,I like the width and the separate numeric pad. The key switches have a good tactile quality when pressed. I had trouble with the keyboard losing strokes until I put the transceiver in a USB extender nearer to the keyboard. And some of the keys are strangely sized which means there is a learning curve when typing on this even if you are used to a split keyboard.
5,I've been using ergonomic keyboards since 1992. This is my first wireless ergonomic but not my first wireless keyboard/mouse. It is easily the most responsive wireless that I've owned and the most comfortable. The only downsides are that the num and caps lock indicators are on-screen and only appear briefly and the fn alternate keys are controlled by a switch and not a key/combo. However the separate wireless number keypad is a great feature.
2,I ordered this desktop in September and couldn't wait to begin using it -- I wasn't disappointed.  I wanted both the flexibility of a wireless keyboard with the functionality of an ergonomic keyboard.  I broke several of the bones in one of my hands a few years ago and that combined with the fact I often spend up to 18 hours a day at a keyboard made this a necessity to avoid discomfort. I LOVED the  keys: so quiet and responsive.  I type very quickly and don't believe everyone in other offices down the hall should wonder if I'm attacking my computer when I'm doing so.  It took a few days to get accustomed to the separate keyboard but i loved it once I did.  The mouse looks "like it was stung by a bee" according to one coworker but felt wonderful.Why only two stars?  It earned the second star only because of the positives noted above.  I use this equipment in an office setting -- it never leaves my desktop.  I undock my laptop and take it with me each day but leave the peripherals in place. I'm the only person using my office so it only has to deal with my handling.  And the only piece of equipment I've longed to throw against the window sometimes is the laptop not the keyboard.5 weeks after purchasing it just.stopped.working. I undocked at 10 pm & went home.  At 8 a.m. i docked my laptop and attempted to sign in. Nope. I went through all the standard checks & even had the company IT out to check it.  Done.  Just over it.  It had apparently decided that was all the time it felt like spending with us and was now over it. Exactly 6 days outside the return window.Amazon true to their unfailing customer first policy worked with me right away to address/correct.  Amazon customer service: 5 stars.Desktop: 1 star.(Logitech if you're out there....can you create a wireless ergonomic keyboard that functions like this one but you know WORKS?)
5,I've purchased both this and the Microsoft Sculpt without the mouse. I bought this one so I'd have a set for work. I love Love LOVE this keyboard! I had used the Logitech Wave keyboard for years but the travel distance of the keys was starting to make my hands cramp with how much I type during the day then I was (finally after 25 years) diagnosed with carpal tunnel.. so I started looking into truly ergonomic keyboards. Better late than never.I've had my home one for a couple of months and I still smile when I start using my computer each day. It's a complete joy to type on. It didn't take long to get used to the downward angle (with the riser on it in front). The only thing I'm worried about is when I have to type on someone else's keyboard at work now - maybe I'll just carry mine around :)Excellent keyboard and well worth the price. The keys are easy to type and have much less travel distance and my hands do a lot less cramping at the end of the day. It's also helped with the wrist pain. Not sure what I'm going to do with the 4 Logitech Waves I now have laying around but maybe the kids can get some use of them.
5,I have had this keyboard for less than a week and I wanted to give my impressions. What I was looking for in a new keyboard was a wireless ergonomic keyboard. This keyboard met my expectations and when a product meets or exceeds my expectations I give it 5 stars. It will take some getting used to the mouse because it is a little big but I think I am going to like it. The keyboard is great. As an author I am on a computer keyboard hours a day so comfort and ease of use are critical for me. The keyboard has a nice small footprint on my computer pull out shelve on my desk. The numerical keypad makes things easy to arrange for best management and comfort. I found that some of the keys are not where I am used to but I will get used to that. I don't need the "riser" plastic attachment because the orientation of the keyboard for my hands is perfect with out it. I do miss the number lock caps lock and power lights but that doesn't matter too much. In the future they could design them into where the "cleft separation" is in the keyboard. All in all I am happy with this keyboard.
4,I actually really did enjoy this keyboard. It helped releve a lot of my carpal tunnel pain since I work on the computer all day. I got used to the keyboard and mouse fast and definitely love that it is wireless. I would change it from my desktop to my laptop with ease. Keyboard is not compatable with imac for certain function keys.However only one year in and my keyboard is no longer working. My mouse and keypad work fine but they keyboard no longer functions. I changed the batteries several times & nothing. I still use my mouse with my imac for traveling but I ended up switchin to a completely new keyboard and mouse for my desktop.
3,I've had every version of Microsoft's "Natural" series of ergonomic keyboards.  This is by far the best effort yet.  I like the relatively short keystrokes and the relatively low effort.  The key placement is good but the layout will take a little getting used to after so many years on the prior layouts.  The mouse is good but not great.  My main complaint about the mouse is the back button is too obscured hard to find by feel and too recessed to press easily.  There's really no excuse for that.  I'm using my Logitech Performance MX - best mouse on the market.  And the USB receiver of the Microsoft Sculpt Desktop protrudes a little too far for me to be willing to leave it permanently installed in my laptop and just toss it in a bag.  The Logitech USB receiver is considerably sleeker.Update 1/25/2014 - now that I've used this keyboard for a few weeks I've begun to experience two peculiar problems: (1) when I type the letters "t" and "e" I often get double entry of those characters as if the keys are bouncing when I press them.  (2) sometimes I experience strange results when double clicking files to open where the properties dialog for the file opens instead of the file opening in the associated application. If I press the alt key the mouse function returns to normal.These problems appear to be getting more frequent.  I've tried it on two computers: one Thinkpad T61 with Windows Vista and a Thinkpad T520 with Windows 7 and I'm experiencing the same problems on both machines.  I've ordered a replacement from Amazon and will report back.
4,The MS Sculpt keyboard is just what I was looking for. Having had RSI in the past I wanted both the split keyboard and the "chicklet" style keys so that the key press "travel" was minimized. I got both of those things with this keyboard. The press is perfect for what I was looking for (gone are the days when I reveled in the old IBM style THUNK keyboards) and I can type quickly and with minimal effort.The mouse is another story. WTF? It is a very odd shape I don't think it does much for RSI regarding mousing (but that's never been my issue) and the buttons often don't work. Not sure what it is or why it happens but every so often the left mouse button gets stuck and I have to CRUNCH down on it to get it to click. Then it's fine again for the next day or week or several hours until it happens again.I would have loved to have bought just the keyboard but they only sell this one bundled. The keyboard is marvelous I love having the keypad available but not connected and the mouse is just badly designed and poorly executed.
5,I have fibro and joint problems so a normal flat keyboard makes my hands hurt in like 20 minutes. I use this set all day without issues (I convinced my employer to buy one for my cube and I have my own personal set at home) even on days where I write a lot of html css and emails. My hands are too small for something like the kinesis advantage but this works great for me (not to mention it's actually cheaper). Even with my tiny hands the mouse is supper comfy; when I use it my hand is really close to if I just totally relax my hand.I even once spilled most of a fresh cup of tea on the keyboard at a starbucks and it still works. I mean I quickly flipped it over to get the tea out of itand one ctrl key sticks now but it works. None of keys ever had sticking issues before I spilled tea on it.Only downside is that microsoft didn't make a version of this keyboard that has bluetooth so it doesn't work with my ipad. But it works great on every mac and windows machine I've connected it to. I've never had to go out and find drivers for it or anything like that.
5,Absolutely stunned by the elegance of the keyboard and bought the set even though I already separately own that same mouse--it's cheaper to get them together.This keyboard is exactly what I want because I have a relatively small desk and don't like to stretch my arm to reach the mouse at the right side. So without the number pad attached this really saves me so much space. This is also much better than the 4000 previous generation which I previously owned. The support pad attaches to the keyboard automatically thorough magnetic attraction and no need to manually push or pull anything. The feeling of the typing is surprisingly good even though in general  I enjoy traditional mechanical instead of laptop like keyboard. This one is less blocky than the former but deeper and softer than the latter. Also I find the function keys which enable to shift between desktops very useful. It's almost like rediscovering Windows!Overall I'm very happy withto the purchase (and surprisingly it's 96 now whereas I had it for 86). I guess compared with many other views that find the separation of the number pad from the keyboard defective my experience is quite the opposite.
5,OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG... why did I put off buying this.  It's worth every cent.  I was getting sore arms and wrists using my old traditional style keyboard and mouse.  Being the cheapo that I am I constantly put off ordering this expensive setup but knew I wanted it.  Finally I said the hell with it and ordered this microsoft sculpt setup.  I was up and running in less than 5 minutes.  Simply plugged in the keyboard USB receiver in back on my PC then pulled out the battery tabs on the keyboard mouse and number pad.  It did take about 30 minutes to get used to holding my hands differently.  However now I'll struggle to go back to a traditional keyboard.  I can type MUCH MUCH faster with easy and comfort now.  And the mouse is simply amazing.  Instead of contorting your wrist you simply wave your arm and it does what you want.  Much like if it were reading your brain.  It's so amazing.  I cannot even stress that.  You probably think I'm trying to sell this keyboard... but I'm not I'm simply saying how awesome it is.  One of the best purchases I've made for my business comfort and well being.  I HIGHLY encourage purchasing this setup.
4,Things I like:  -  Great ergonomic design. I like the downward angle with the riser attached.  -  The magnets to hold the riser in place. I have had so many clip-on plastic risers that have broken over the years.  -  The wireless transceiver doesn't interfere with my Logitech mouse transceiver.Things I don't like: -  The small-size function keys are acceptable only if you do not use them very often. If you are a vi user you will either hate this keyboard very quickly or you will map Escape to something else like Caps Lock or Ctrl.  -  Because there is no separation between the main keys and the cursor movement keys it is hard to find the right keys in that area by feel.Other thoughts:  -  We don't all agree on which side some of the keys (e.g. 6  B) should go. Why not duplicate them on both sides?  -  I think the toggle switch is great but some people would rather have a Fn shift key. Why not have both?
4,This is a fantastic keyboard and mouse in terms of ergonomics. I had recently hurt my wrist and this made the pain while typing all but go away. That said the USB dongle is WAY too big and finicky. It's like we went back 5 years - it sticks out a whole 5/8 of an inch from my laptop making it too risky to leave on my computer when I take it away from my desk and throw it in a bag. It isn't like the mini 1/4 inch dongles we have become used to. It also does NOT work properly through my new ANKER USB 3.0 hub. It seems rather power hungry and wants to be connected directly to the computer or else it intermittently disconnects and reconnects (especially when the computer goes to sleep).I'd still reluctantly recommend the keyboard and mouse despite these flaws for their ergonomics since there isn't a comparable set up out there. I especially like that the numeric pad is separate for those of us with tight keyboard trays. But Microsoft really needs to fix the tranceiver.
5,The best feature is the number pad is detached and all 3 prices the keyboard mouse and number pad use only one USB port for the Bluetooth connector. I like it so much I got one for home and work. Typing takes a little getting used to because of the keyboard shape and gap in the middle but it feels good and I would definitely call it ergonomic
5,This is a must-have and especially after the keyboards of the Macbooks have taken a nosedive. Typing on this is a joy and at least 100x better than typing on the Macbook Pro's sub-par keyboards.Especially when using web products like Notion Figma etc. the mouse is much more comfortable and the heft drive more accuracy than the lightweight ones I had earlier or the Mac trackpad.The battery on the keyboard lasts an age; the mouse runs out faster. However the switch on the mouse to turn it off is super helpful.What would make this better:1. Bluetooth instead of the USB A dongle.2. At the very least this should now include a USB-C dongle also.
4,Excellent keyboard.  Comfortable and fast if you're a good typist (one and two-fingered typists need not apply).  Hard to describe how "natural" my hand placement is except to say that with the exception of stretching for the Backspace key or going to the keyboard the heels of my hands don't move while typing. Cool.  As for the mouse other than being as comfortable (once you get used to putting your thumb in the groove instead of grabbing it like a baseball) it has a couple of surprisingly good additions.  One being the Windows key which takes you back to the Start screen in one click and the other being a button just below it and in the thumb groove that moves your browser back one page - wonderful for checking search links for the one you want - look click back look next - fabulous.  Downside?  Learning to grip the mouse takes a little bit and if you are a hunt and peck typist this keyboard is a speed typing trainer (if you're already reasonably good this will make you better).
4,I didn't think it was possible to make a better keyboard than the Microsoft Natural. But this is. The keys are quieter now and the whole thing feels even more comfortable. My typing speed has increased and seems to have gotten more accurate. I have always liked trackballs but the mouse it came with has proved to be extremely comfortable.There are only two downsides. This is a wireless keyboard. A dongle custom coded to your mouse and keyboard plugs into a USB port on your computer. DON'T EVER LOSE IT BECAUSE IT CAN'T BE REPLACED!!!The other problem was that I got this keyboard through Amazon Warehouse Deals. Upon opening it I found that the AAA batteries in the keyboard had corroded. I had to throw them away and clean out the battery compartment before the keyboard would work! Had I been a little bit less handy with the cleaning tools I probably would have returned the whole thing.
4,Pros:* One of the only keyboards with this type design and low-travel keys* The mushier keys may not feel as nice but the added cushioning is really great if you're dealing with RSI and related* The mouse is awkward looking but actually works feels pretty nice to use in practice* Helped tremendously with my RSI symptoms* 10-key is kept separate which helps minimize excessive movement from normal keyboard use to mouse.Cons:* Not bluetooth - if you can't manage to make bluetooth work at least offer a wired version* Would've preferred Li-ion usb-charging vs heavy removable batteries* No mac layout version - it's not a huge deal but the useless menu key is still as questionable as ever* Mouse windows key seems like a bizarre choice and would have strongly preferred a standard Button4/Button5.* Has trouble re-connecting with my macbook when resuming from sleep unless I unplug and replug the usb adapter
5,I regularly switch between my full-sized but flat keyboard on my notebook computer and this ergonomic keyboard.  It takes a minute or two to adjust each time but it is well worth it.  The keys at the edges fall-to-finger -- like the "hyphen" and the "0" and the "tilda" -- much easier.  And of course my shoulders stay relaxed where no matter how much I try with a flat keyboard my neck muscles tense up even with type only a couple of pages.Microsoft's packaging needs to improve.  I carefully looked through all of it to find the USB transmitter.  I never did although I feel pretty certain it was there someplace.  The very nice fellow at Radio Shack tried to help me because he had seen it happen with many customers but the only thing I ended up coming up with was to buy a smart mouse just to get the transmitter.There have been no good trackball updates in years.  Most trackballs have gone out of production.  Anyone who has used a good track ball knows that it is just as ergonomically magical as is this sculpted keyboard when it is compared to any mouse made -- including the expensive one included with this keyboard.  So I'm giving it away to the local Thrift Store.
5,I had been looking for an ergonomic wireless keyboard/mouse unit that would fit into the standard computer carryall or backpack for years so I could utilize it with my laptop when I travel. I have become so used to the ergonomic design that I practically can't type on a regular squared-up keyboard any more much less the small built-in laptop version. I used to take my large keyboard with me by using a piece of luggage so it would fit. It was cumbersome but sorta filled my needs. But now finally someone built one that is short and ergonomic as well.This design is perfect for me. It shortens the unit by separating the numbers keys that normally reside on the right side of every standard keyboard and makes those keys a separate unit. I will probably throw that away since I never never use those keys.It's a little different from my large desktop wireless keyboard so I'm making a few typos by not having my hands properly positioned but thatmuscle memory is coming along. I also use it when day-trading by putting it and my laptop next to my desktop computer and dual monitors. That gives me three monitors and two computers to work with and it all fits on my desk. EUREKA!
5,This keyboard is comfortable very similar to my old one that my wrists love.  It seems lighter weight and feels a bit less sturdy than a similar Microsoft ergonomic keyboard I bought several years ago. Hopefully it will hold up as well as the old one. The number pad comes separate which seems a bit odd but since I usually use the numbers at the top of the keyboard I just put the other one in my desk drawer out of the way.  It does save space on my desk top that way.The big tall mouse took a little bit to get used to but now love the way it feels in my hand. It was just different from my old one.At first I was having trouble with the door to the mouse battery compartment not staying on (see photo below) but after posting about it with the photo below I had feedback saying that I had it on backwards :)  Oops!  Seems a bit counter-intuitive for the writing to be not visible but as long as it works its good. I flipped it over and it magnetically stays on very well. I appreciated the feedback!
4,Found it while looking for a reasonably priced wireless split keyboard to help with my carpel tunnel wrists. I have it for more than a week.  Generally I am happy with it.  I just put the numpad away while trying to get use to the mouse.My main complain is with the Escape key - as a programmer and vi/vim user who hits [Escape] very frequently it is too stiff and a little small.  The function/media keys are the same too stiff and small though I use them less.  I like the function lock idea though I would like a quick function combo key also (ALA Shift and Shift-Lock).The gap between the left and right side seems like wasted real estate to me.  I wonder if it would be possible to fit a track ball/track pad in there for future versions preferably integrated or as a separate piece. The mouse buttons and scroll wheels can then be fitted between the space bars or below it on the center of the wrist rest.
3,I loved the shape and contour of this keyboard! Very ergonomic and comfy! My fingers fell into a natural position and it was super easy to type after after a couple days. You get used to the bent shape of the keyboard when you are typing on it for 8+ hours a day like I do.Plus the Bluetooth connectivity from the USB port was great. No lag at all with MacBook Pro - which is a worry with external keyboards.The opening of the product was seamless and beautiful! Was able to set up so quickly!The only con is that after using for 3 days which is why I rated 3 stars was the material for the wrist support. After 3 days of use the black material started to turn white already where my wrists were resting. After those 3 days it had already "looked" like it was a year old. For something that is "high quality" and a Microsoft product- especially with the higher cost this shouldn't of happened. That was a huge disappointment to see it wear down so quickly.Made me skeptical how the rest of the keys or mouse would work over a using a period of weeks months etc.
5,I'm very happy with this keyboard and mouse combo.  It just arrived yesterday but I could immediately tell the keyboard was high quality by how solid it felt to hold.  The keys have a nice feel the mouse clicks feel precise and I really like how the number pad is broken off allowing me to save desk space.  The USB wireless receiver also seems improved over older Microsoft receivers with better range.I found 2 little annoyances though.  The USB receiver is very small and I'm afraid I'm going to lose it switching between different machines.  I'd prefer the keyboard and mouse to either be Bluetooth-enabled or to have a physically larger wireless receiver.  Also the keyboard is going to require some pinky finger muscle-memory retraining.  The keys on the right-hand side all fit into 2 neat columns.  I guess it looks nice but the arrow positional and delete keys are hard to find without looking.  After using Microsoft's Natural Ergonomic keyboards for years it's going to take a while to get used to the new layout.Overall I think this keyboard and mouse set is a big improvement over the older (but still great) Natural Ergonomic keyboards and mice.
5,Great keyboard. I purchased this keyboard to use with my Microsoft Surface Book. The design of the keyboard for that device is not great and caused my carpal tunnel to become aggravated. I have an office job and am a writer and needed the ergonomic design to keep my wrists healthy. Unfortunately I do not have a long well thought out review as some of the others. But I can say that this keyboard is great. I especially love the number pad as well as the wrist support. It comes with a riser to place under the keyboard to ensure the wrist alignment is maintained to prevent inflammation.The only drawback is that there was slight learning curve since I haven't used an ergo design in almost 10 years. I almost had to re-learn how to type which reduces my typing speed. However after only a week or so I am much better and can type just as good as I do with a conventional keyboard.Lastly I do wish this were Bluetooth design. However the adapter is so small I barely notice it's there. Not to mention that Microsoft's Bluetooth ergo keyboard is really expensive.
5,I use this keyboard for work and it's really nice. I don't use the mouse because I already have a ball mouse. But it works just fine without it. It's lightweight and very responsive so happy with it.
4,I really like how comfortable the keyboard is to use.  The numeric keypad isn't as comfortable to use but its super handy to pull it out only when you need it.  I code a lot of in VI and I don't like the small escape key.  The wireless transmission on both the keyboard and numeric pad is great.  I never had a problem.  The pad on the keyboard seems like it will wear poorly.  I've had mine for two weeks and its already losing color.The mouse is comfortable to use but it seems more prone to interference.  I had the usb key behind a monitor and I had to move it to a foot and a half from the mouse.  Much further than that and the mouse gets laggy.  I have to deduct for that.  It would have been better if this entire set was bluetooth.
5,Keyboard is comfortable keys have nice feel and response. It was very easy for me to adapt to the curved layout. The mouse feels a bit too large and starts to feel sweaty after a little use. The mouse does turn your wrist a bit and keeps you from pressing on the nerves. I will keep trying the mouse but just not sure. Overall it's one of the nicer keyboards I've used in recent times and I plan to order another for work.The only thing that remains to be seen is battery life; I would have liked to see a rechargeable option.Updated 6/26/2014:After using this for a while I found that the mouse did become much easier to use and really wasn't as bad as I initially thought. I've become quite comfortable with the mouse and keyboard and find it hard to go back to a standard mouse configuration.Battery life has been excellent I frequently forget to turn off the mouse and it doesn't seem to go dead on me. The battery in the keypad is a button cell and if a button gets stuck (or you have something heavy pressing on the buttons like I did) the battery will die.Upgraded rating from 4 to 5 stars. Well worth the purchase (I now own two of these)!
5,I have only been able to use the Microsoft brand of ergo keyboards over the last decade and this has been a great improvement for lightweight wireless design.
2,I was very very excited to get this item and was immediately disappointed. I have used the Microsoft Ergonomic keyboards in the past and have been using my Logitech wireless keyboard/mouse for years. For some reason this keyboard misses keystrokes. Mine was specifically horrible with the "N". Backspace was also "slow" where you would hit it 5 times 4 would be instant and the 5th keystroke would eventually happen.I am an IT Network Engineer and know my way around a PC. I have disconnected as much as I could from my USB ports to attempt finding a solution and even moved the USB receiver dongle up to the desk. Personally I think there is just too much going on. The Numberpad keyboard and mouse all probably talk on the same frequency and it gets confused. I do think I had no problems with the mouse and numberpad. Both were very responsive. The keyboard here is what is known to have problems.While I wanted this to work very much I had to return it. I was hoping the "N" key would break in and get better but it seemed to get worse. I plugged up my old trusty logitech keyboard/mouse combo and the difference is night and day. I am unsure if they have a large batch of defective units or if they are all bad but there are lots of negative reviews online with the same input lag issues with the keyboard. Hopefully they come out with a Revision 2 or a new model soon.I also found that I never got used to the mouse. I would still rest my palm on the table for better control and because the mouse is so BIG it would actually bend my wrist worse and cause more pain. I know I wasn't holding it right but I lost a lot of control otherwise.
3,Overall this is a very comfortable and well-designed Keyboard/Mouse combination.  It's style is very Apple-esqe.  An example is the use of magnets to hold the keyboard riser and battery door as well as the number pad that is a separate device.  I can type for long periods of time with great accuracy and speed.  The mouse is comfortable however it is a bit heavy and definitely does not work well for left-handers.  The number pad leaves a lot to be desired however.  Unlike the keyboard (which uses 2 AAA batteries) the number pad uses a large coin-sized battery (CR2430).  They are hard to find and when you do find them they are more expensive than standard AAA.  I found a 6-pack of Duracell-brand ones on Amazon and I'm glad that I bought in bulk because I'm only averaging about a month on a battery.  I am still running on the original AAA batteries in the main keyboard!  Microsoft should have made the number pad just slightly thicker and used AAA batteries.  Also unlike previous Microsoft ergonomic keyboards there are no native OS X drivers for it.  I'd love to know why Microsoft decided to axe the OS X drivers as they have historically had very good OS X support.  There have to be plenty of Mac users that would love to have a well-designed Ergonomic keyboard.  The basic functionality of typing and mousing will work in OS X but the only Function keys that work are the volume keys.
1,This keyboard literally worked for 10 seconds. I plugged it in and it worked for all of about 2 minutes before there it started intermittently disconnecting. After a while it just stopped working entirely and no matter which port it was plugged into or which computer I tried it on it would not start working again. I could not detect it in device manager or anywhere else on the computer. Keyboard and Mouse monitor showed no devices. Waste of money. Seems to be a recurring issue for this keyboard. Do not buy
3,First off the actual keyboard is narrower than it appears in the pics.  It's still wide enough though.I thought I'd hate the chicklet keys but I actually like them.  The layout is much better than the Logitech but then I'm used to MS ergo keyboards.  The palm pad is vastly superior to the Logitech it uses actual memory foam although it is a little short.The keyboard is a little wobbly if you put a finger on each side of the front but this doesn't seem to be noticeable when typingUnlike the Logitech very few keys are re-assignable in any meaningful way.And no you can't set the left space bar to backspace as with the comfort keyboard.The mouse is weird but not bad after a while.The buttons are placed too far towards the front to be easy to use.Once again almost nothing is re-assiganable e.g. the left-right scroll buttons.  In fact only the side button can be changed.The wheel is clicky and sticky which is not my preference but in a much quieter more substantial way than the Logitech.  On the plus side it doesn't have the Logitech's problem with using the wheel as a middle button only to have it roll you to the top of the page instead because it spins to freely.Overall this desktop rates 4 and a half stars for useablity 2 and a half for configurability.  It could have been great it's just good but given the options I don't regret the purchase.
5,This is the only keyword and mouse combo I will use. I've bought multiple over the years for home and office. I love the low profile button action (like what you get on a laptop keyboard) with the benefit of an ergonomic split layout. As someone who is on the computer typing for 8+ hours every day and someone who has suffered from a repetitive stress injury in the past due to poor ergonomics this keyboard/mouse is absolutely THE BEST!!
5,Everything connected to the laptop computer with no issues love not having a bunch of wires
3,This keyboard mouse and numeric keypad set is finely designed very comfortable to use although it takes a while to get used to not being cramped into a flat straight keyboard style as found on traditional keyboards. There is however one bit drawback. There are not indicators showing when CapsLock and  NumLock are on. There is no PowerOn light either. The CapsLock indicator missing is the big problem. The NumLock is somewhat unnecessary since the numeric keypad stands alone but not knowing when CapsLock is on or off without first entering a "test" entry is the pits. Think of entering secure passwords managing upper and lowercase letter numbers etc. It boggles the mind why Microsoft would bypass these most necessary elements in a set which is often priced above $100. I would pay $50 more for the same clean efficient feel and the proper indicator lights.
5,This is the third one of these keyboards that I have owned. Two for work and one for my home office.  They are the easiest and most comfortable keyboards to use.  The keys are whisper quiet and they have a good tactile feel to them.  I have been using ergonomic keyboards for over 25 years and this is the best one that I have found.
4,I love the keyboard.  I've been using Microsoft ergonomic keyboards for quite a while so when I saw this one I had to get it.  The mouse has a little lag in it.  But then again I have yet to plug this into a Windows box so maybe that would cure the mouse lag issue.  I can say it works well with Linux and Mac.  The covers for the battery for both mouse and keyboard (not the keypad) are held on by magnets.  The benefit of this is the ease in which they come off and re-attach.  The detriment is if you go mobile make sure you don't loose the covers (I almost lost mine but I discovered it soon enough to find it).So overall the keyboard is great the mouse is OK for most uses but if you are a gamer the mouse lags enough to not be useful (I always keep a wired mouse around for gaming time anyway since I have yet to find a good wireless mouse that is responsive enough).
2,I enjoy the feel of the keyboard very light touch with a satisfying click (but not noisy). The feel is similar to many laptop chiclet keyboards but with a slightly longer keystroke. I have had it a month now and feel like I have mostly adjusted to it however it did take a bit longer to get used to than previous Microsoft Ergonomic keyboards. I can't quite figure out why that is but my touch typing was seriously slowed down for a while (and sometimes still a bit off). It seems too easy to get my hands off the home keys without noticing especially the right hand. Overall the typing experience on the keyboard is good though I like it more than the standard Dell keyboard I had before.The mouse is very poor for me. It is far too high off the desk so it causes my wrist to be bent upwards pretty drastically. I stopped using it in favor of a standard wired mouse. I will explore other ergonomic mice options. Apart from the ergonomics the wireless performance is really really bad. At three feet it completely doesn't work at all. I had to buy a small USB extender to get it a little closer. Even then it gets jumpy frequently. My old wireless mouse has never had this issue.The keyboard also has some wireless issues. It mostly works fine but occasionally will start missing keystrokes. It's not enough to make it unusable but it is frustrating. The keyboard is literally three inches from the receiver with the USB extender I bought. This is why I don't generally go with wireless keyboards too finicky (plus who wants to change batteries anyway?). Overall I was hoping for better. I don't know if both of these problems are somehow due to using this with a Mac but either way I'd say this is a disappointment overall.
3,Probably the best split-style ergonomic keyboard Microsoft has released to-date. I have had all of the previous models and I can easily say this one is the best. The layout is great the keys are quick and responsive everything just works perfectly. I have no complaints about this keyboard at all. The mouse is also really awesome but I would only give it 4 stars. The glossy finish is OK but it seems to build up more grim than a matte or soft-touch finish. The shape of the mouse is perfect for me it seems to be in this nice little sweet spot between a typical flat-style mouse and those vertical ergo mice you see these days. I like the mouse so much for my day to day (work) activities that I am considering a second one for home & gaming use.Update after 10 months of use: Dropped the rating down to 3 stars from 5. Everything was great for a while but now almost once per day (~8 hours of at-work use) the keyboard keypad and mouse all loose their connection to the wireless dongle. I have to unplug / plug in the dongle to get the keyboards & mouse to work again. This seems to be a relatively common problem and of course Microsoft offers nothing very helpful whenever they are asked about this problem. If I knew about this problem back when I purchased this combo I would have kept looking. It saddens me to have to lower my initial rating I really like the keyboard.
1,I bought this after much product research as I suffer from slight pain from carpel tunnel.  The layout of the keys in general is fantastic.  It immediately alleviated my sore wrists from all day of typing.  However there is something very very wrong with the USB dongle circuitry.  Every day sometimes twice a day it causes every single USB port on my desktop to freeze and become non-responsive.  I cannot unplug/replug the dongle either... it's just plain dead.  As there is no way to reboot I have to hold the power button down in order to shutdown and totally start over...loosing most of my work. Sometimes this happens after waking from sleep sometimes it happens right in the middle of composing an email.  I went back to my old Logitech wireless keyboard and the problem has not occurred since (over a week) so I'm 99.99% sure that the culprit of "USB Freezing" is the Microsoft Keyboard.  I've never seen anything like it.  And now it's too late to return it... (only 2 months old).UPDATE*** I contacted MS shortly after writing this review and they offered to exchange the item for a new one but I had to cover shipping to them.  So I sent the defective Ergo Sculpt back to MS delivered on 6/27.  I was contacted and said it should take 2 weeks before my new Sculpt was mailed back to me.  1 week later I got a msg that they are backlogged.  Another week another apology.  On 7/27 (a month after delivery) I was informed that they are out of stock on the Ergo Sculpt and wanted to send me the 'next best thing' which was about HALF the price I paid for the Sculpt.  I said "No Thanks" as I intended to just sell the replacement to recoup my $.  No I've been waiting another 3 weeks for them to 'figure out a solution'.  I was promised a replacement then it was withdrawn they have my keyboard AND my $ AND the $ it cost me to ship the defective item back to them.  Come on MS I think we can do better than this!
5,I am surprised so many gave poor reviews.  I have had this keyboard and mouse and used it every day pretty much for about 10 years or more now.  I have had no problems despite the fact that I have been moving it in a back pack and smushing the keys in often.  The only thing I have had to do is pull the keys out of decompressed state and the keyboard and mouse have worked great.  I thought it was broken one time but then found the key that I smushed in while it was in the back pack.  I am very satisfied with this keyboard.  I have not seen any of the problems like slow or anything else like that and I used my computer about 10 hours a day 5 or 6 days a week.  Usually close to 60 hours a week.
3,While it works it’s a reasonably good ergo keyboard & mouse but longevity is an issue. My first one lasted almost five years before sticking little keys (escape and function keys) stuck badly enough to render it useless. (This started early on but they would unstick.) The second mouse is failing now after 2 years. For what it’s worth my wife is still using the first mouse with her laptop.If you mouse right handed the separate 10-key means that your right arm is not an awkward angle. On the other hand if you actually use the 10 key I can’t imagine this is what you want.In case you missed it elsewhere the mouse and keyboard are matched to one USB adapter. If any part fails you replace everything.I use it with Windows 10 on an HP laptop and with a Ubuntu  18.04 on an Intel nuc.
3,*15 Month Update*Right mouse button is pretty much dead.Right side of the space bar has intermittent issues (does not register a key press).I use this keyboard/mouse 9 hours a day 5 days a week in a professional environment. I am not sure if I should be mad that parts are failing or just accept it. Overall I do feel a bit disappointed.********************This is the most comfortable mouse ever. I was worried I wouldn't like it because I had never used an ergonomic mouse but my concerns were unfounded the mouse is great for my large hands. My wife has tiny hands and she is not as crazy about it so you may want to consider this before buying.The keyboard looks nice and functions well. It takes some getting used to and I have been making significantly more typing errors but I've only had it for a day and I am making less mistakes. The typing errors may be because I never really typed "properly". For example I use my right hand to type 'b' which you cannot do on an ergonomic keyboard.The separate number pad is both useful and irritating. I like to keep my mouse close to my keyboard and it does not quite fit. On the other had when I am entering data into excel or simply using the calculator its very comfortable. I like that it has its own backspace key and a dedicated calculator button (opens the windows calculator).
2,The pro's:- good ergonomics for the keyboard- mouse is pretty good too (much better than I actually expected)- relatively inexpensivethe con's:- keys could have a nicer feel (my Lenovo laptop has better key feel)- the wrist pad does fade out/get white streaks really quickly- *********It keeps missing keystrokes****************This last thing makes me want to throw the keyboard across the room!!!  As I am typing this every other sentence has a word or two with several missing letters.  It isn't the pressure of typing nor is it a certain key or group of keys.  It just occurs randomly like the keyboard went to sleep and wakes up half way through a word.  It is most noticeable after pausing a moment.  I sometimes have to lift the keyboard and set it back down to get it to respond (a little light goes on between the space bar keys when you do this). I have Windows 10 and this may  be a factor - considering Windows 10 HATES USB devices!  Every update it stops recognizing USB devices and I have to do a workaround.  I've used Windows for ~30 years and I may just switch to Mac.I had to edit this post - and every other thing I type (I'm in graduate school and type ALOT!!!) because of all the missing letters and words.  For example if the word "it" or "be" is in a sentence and the keyboard flakes out the whole word is missing.  Makes typing really slow because I keep looking to makes sure the keyboard is responding and having to correct.I give it 2 stars because the design is nice and comfortable the mouse works fine but the issue with missing keystrokes is enough  drive me insane.  Would NOT recommend to purchase.
5,Bought this because it was supposed to be the best ergonomic keyboard out there that you didn't have to spend over $150 on.  My wrists were hurting so bad at work using a normal keyboard and mouse all day that I eventually went to the doctor.  Nothing they could do other than tell me to rest and take anti-inflammatory meds.  Well I can't exactly not use a mouse and keyboard all day.I've had this setup for about a month now and I can honestly say I have not had any pain.  The keyboard is wonderful the mouse takes some getting use to but it's so much better after you use it a while.  The only down side I have to this and its super minor is the keypad number "0" doesn't always want to register.  I can get going very quickly with a numpad on normal keyboard but this one tends to miss my zeros.  It may be the layout or the keys or what but other than that this is a magical keyboard set.
5,This is a fabulous ergonomic keyboard that perfectly combines goodness of Apple style chiclet keyboard with Microsoft's exceptional ergonomic keyboard design.Keyboard: Very easy low effort typing. Quiet. Great palm support pad. Make sure you install the bottom bracket to get the full ergonomics. The separate keyboard pad is a nice touch which in essence reduces the amount of space you needs for this keyboard on your desk. It is quite annoying that they combined mute and other volume control switches with the function keys. You have to pick one or the other with a swap switch. I have chosen to ignore this minor inconvenience.Mouse: It does feel very ergonomic on your right hand. I use my mouse with both hands and hence this one has been decommissioned already and I am using my ambidextrous Logitech M510 mouse. If you do choose to use the mouse that comes with this set make sure your wrist rest is at least 1" to 1.5" high so that you don't hurt your wrist. Pay attention to the wrist height so that it stays at the same height of the top of the mouse i.e. good ergonomic posture.Overall: I'd highly recommend this product. Excellent work by Microsoft. Buy it and you will not regret it.
5,I love this package.  I use one at work and at home.  This is my third set and I recommend this package to all of my friends and co-workers.
4,Great keyboard first ergonomic keyboard for me. The wrist resting area is nice and soft. The mouse glides very smoothly and I have grown to like the large size of it it really is more comfortable to use. The one problem with this is the unnecessarily large USB receiver. It sticks out almost an inch from the computer whereas most USB receivers for keyboards and mice these days stick out maybe 1/4th of an inch. Due to the length it is very easy to break - and I broke it. Microsoft cannot just send you a new receiver either. I talked with them about my broken receiver and they had to send me a whole new keyboard mouse num pad and receiver together - free of charge however which was amazing. But I would prefer a more durable receiver design than to have to wait to be shipped the product again if possible.My advice to you is buy this great keyboard/mouse setup and just be a little careful with the receiver :)
1,I purchased this product for over $100 being sold by Microsoft's promise of a superior ergonomic design. For the couple of months that I was able to use it I found the Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop (L5V-00001) to be a very satisfying typing and interfacing experience. However all of these advantages are obviated by the fact that the folks who developed this product were strangely compelled to pair it with a wireless USB dongle that--while perhaps visually appealing--has a much larger-than-necessary exterior profile when plugged into a computer's USB port. It therefore is apt to bend or break if say you casually slip your laptop into your carrying case without remembering to take the dongle out open the underside cover to the mouse's housing and insert the dongle into the provided storage recess (which itself is a bit of a nuisance after the first dozen or so times).Now one might ask why would I be using this bundle of peripherals with a laptop or other device that I frequently carry around with me in the first place since the Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop is not  very portable? I was using the full keyboard/mouse set at work and then taking my work laptop and mouse or simply the mouse and dongle home with me to use there since the mouse truly is a well designed product but in my situation a bit too expensive to own one for work and one for home.Needless to say the wireless USB dongle for my Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop set ultimately broke--which in and of itself would have been understandable if Microsoft were willing to replace what I assume is a very cheap-to-produce component with a spare for free or at a modest price. However when I called Microsoft support they replied that there was nothing at all that they could do about it and that I could not get a replacement from them at any price. What's up with that?I have previously been a loyal Microsoft customer--one of the few out there in my millennial age cohort. I own a laptop with Windows 8 a Nokia cellphone with Windows Phone as the OS and have even been the proud owner of a 1st-generation Zune in my day. It's customer service shortfalls such as this that give me pause to reconsider...
5,The Microsoft Sculpt keyboard-mouse combo is without a doubt the most comfortable I've ever experienced.  I didn't know I needed it but now that I have it I'll never use anything else.The mouse is my favorite; it feels so natural in the palm of my hand.  The back and Windows buttons combined with the sideways scroll feature on the wheel make this mouse extremely functional (without feeling overwhelming with the amount of options that some gaming mice have).The keyboard is also quite comfortable.  It does takes it little getting used to because I've been typing incorrectly all these years.  I feel like it's correcting my bad typing habits such as overreaching with the wrong hand.The only shortcoming that I've noticed is that it doesn't have indicators lights to let you know when Num Lock and Caps Lock are activated. It would be really nice if Microsoft could include this in later models. All in all the ergonomic benefits by far outweigh the small amount of time it takes to get used to the feel of the keyboard.  5 Stars.
4,PROS: Looks good; much smaller than the other microsoft ergonimic keyboard (which I've owned); convenient to plug in one usb for keyboard mouse and number pad; actually feels more comfortable for someone who has carpal and cubital tunnel syndrome - it does make a difference over traditional keyboards.CONS: I've used this keyboard with my Macbook Pro for months now and I notice there is sometimes a lag between my typing and what displays on the screen. Sometimes I will hit the spacebar between words and the space won't appear on the screen. My laptop software and OS are up to date. Also when the product first arrived I noticed that the 'H' key was a little sticky and I could not press it down at a slightly inward angle without it sticking. None of the other keys had that problem.
5,In the past I've always been a Logitech guy. But lately I've been unhappy with their products. I almost passed this combo up because I've never really liked any wireless mouse or keyboards. I also sometimes play games so I've been a firm believer in wired products. But this combo surprised me! I use this product to play battlefield 4 and it has no problems with using multiple keyboard buttons while aiming with the mouse. I also with most mice my hand starts hurting after a while but this mouse amazingly gives me no pain! The only issue I had was getting use to the ergonomic style of typing. I know some people don't like the fact that it takes 3 different batteries but it's worth it. Normally wireless keyboards last forever on a battery anyway. And the number pad is used so little I would be surprised if I had to change the battery at all in the next few years. I also really like the way the keys click and the magnetic battery covers are a nice touch. The number pad does have a different type of battery cover but I don't really expect that thing to need a new battery for at least 3 years.
1,UPDATE September 2017 after 7 months of use:The keyboard works fine. Many will find that the inconvenience of the middle gap outweighs any ergonomic benefits. I have never seen a clear ergonomic benefit. The real problems with this "wireless desktop" are the mouse and the "wireless.". It is infuriatingly erratic. The connection between mouse keyboard and dongle drops frequently unpredictably and for no apparent reason. It will not be because the batteries need replacing. It will be because of Microsoft's idiotic implementation of bluetooth. Over the years I have had numerous bluetooth devices working with Mac computers and never had similar problems. (Mac has plenty of problems this isn't one of them.) I often wonder whether Microsoft is even aware of what it is attaching its name to.Original review:Horrendous... terrible Bluetooth implementation. Inches from my Windows laptop it routinely stops working even though the batteries are good. You will find yourself thinking the batteries are dead. Maybe you'll replace them. And then it will die again. When? You'll never know. It's random. It's more fun that way! Interrupting your work flow to spend 5 minutes trying to identify why you can't type or click any more is exactly how you want to take a break from the daily desk grind . . . right?Extremely important: You should test-drive the keyboard. I cannot stress that enough. I did a lot of homework/research (I thought). I am more or less accustomed to the keyboard now but it is a long miserable haul to get used to it. And I see no evidence at all that it is helpful for repetitive motion issues.Also critical: You gain almost NOTHING through the Microsoft wireless keyboard and mouse being wireless. Why? You still have to eat up a USB port for the dongle. That is -- a small USB device (about the size of one of the really small flash drives) plugs into a free USB port for the mouse and keyboard to communicate through. Doesn't matter that you might already have Bluetooth on your computer.Finally Microsoft support is non-existent. Microsoft's own operating system usually fails to recognize the company's own hardware.
3,Update 9/22 - the scroll wheel on the mouse stopped working. You can still click with it and if you get the 4-arrow symbol you can make it scroll but the wheel doesn't scroll anymore. I've updated the drivers I've tried a separate different wireless mouse and that works fine so my conclusion is that the mouse wheel stopped working and that is disappointing. The mouse lasted 7 months I hope it is still under warranty. I'm going to try to contact Amazon today to see if I have any options. On the good side the keyboard works fine.I love this keyboard and mouse. I had one at my old job. It is very comfortable having the numeric pad separate takes some getting used to because it's never in the same place. I've had this a little over a month an a half. I don't pound the keys and I use all ten fingers to type and it works fine for me. It takes a light touch and the keys are actually switches not a membrane switch so you get good feedback when typing. The mouse feels good in my hand and appears to be very accurate. I just wish it was a little taller if that makes sense the one it replaced was one of the second or third generation Microsoft ergonomic mice that was taller and filled your hand.
3,The mouse felt uncomfortable in my hand and the keyboard didn't feel that natural to me either - it felt cheap compared to my current Microsoft ergonomic 4000 keyboard which sadly there doesn't seem to be  a wireless replacement for.
2,The hardware itself is great with one exception the usb receiver. It's unnecessarily long (compared to the competition) and far too fragile to hold up to being unplugged ever. The plastic housing for the receiver has very little structural support so the joint where it meets the plug does not hold up well  to the normal amount of force to remove the receiver from a device.As the receiver is not sold separately your only hope is to get a refund from amazon (if it luckily happens quick enough to be within window) or navigate the maze of Microsoft's warranty repair system. Good luck with option 2.Microsoft online warranty support is geared almost exclusively to helping Surface windows and xbox customers. So don't expect to find many answers without spending over an hour in the labyrinth of phone customer support (in which you will repeatedly be asked the wrong questions and forwarded to the wrong department).Long story short if you need an ergonomic keyboard by microsoft blutooth surface keyboard instead or go with a different brand altogether as any hardware design disadvantages other models may have are more than made up for with a more reliable receiver. A well designed keyboard is of no worth if the dongle breaks and with this product you are 100% certain it will sooner or later. This product will serve you well until it inevitably doesnt.[UPDATE]It turns out if you are lucky enough to live in an area with a Microsoft Store you can handle warranty replacements there and it a much better experience than trying to navigate the phone and online warranty support.
5,This is an outstanding keyboard and mouse it completely eliminated hand and wrist fatigue. Plus it looks great.
2,I bought this several months ago for use at home on a desktop PC.  I have fairly large hands and I like this keyboard I've had ergonomic keyboards in the past and this is every bit as good.  As with all new things it's a little different than what I had and took some getting used to but all good for me there.  The key touches are short and light so I can type just a little faster.  The rubber at the bottom is starting to show wear after 2 years.  This keyboard does not get used daily sometimes not even weekly.  I expected more.The scroll wheel on my mouse has also quit working entirely.  pushing it as a button works but rolling the wheel does not.I HATE the separate 10 key pad. It seems to go into standby or something very quickly and then doesn't respond to the first few key strokes.  Sometimes even when typing away it misses strokes.  There's two possible reasons for this one is that it's defective or just not very good and just misses the keystroke.  The second is also my second complaint about the pad it's too narrow so I have a hard time accurately hitting the keys.  If they keyboard is ergonomic the 10 key is not.  I find myself having to move my hand back and forth to hit keys correctly and ultimately just not using the pad.  The fact that its separate and doesn't stay in one place doesn't help that any.  It ends up buried up in the keyboard drawer of the desk.4 stars for the keyboard 1 star for the 10 key 3 stars for the mouse so...2 stars overall
5,Product works well Connects right away the mouse works great and along with the keyboard is ergonomic. Here are my only considerations.1. For whatever reason this keyboard does not like to let me type the same key twice in a row. I haven't spent any time looking if this is an adjustable setting or not.2. With the 10 key pad being detachable I find it not worth my time to track it down to find it and end up just using the numbers across the top. I'm sure if I did a lot of number entry it would be nice to have it separated like it is.3. I'm having a hard time getting used to having to switch the function keys on and off vs holding the function button to toggle between the two.All of the things that I'm adjusting to are simply because they're unfamiliar. I'm sure as I get used to the keyboard I'll grow to like them more but it does take some time to get used to it.
3,It works well as a wireless Ergo Keyboard.  I just would not have located some of they keys where they did.  I think they had some artificial style constraints in their design.Such as:Small ESC key.  One of the keys I use all the time is the smallest on the board and hard to find.Small Function Keys / Dual Purpose:  If you are a function key user then this keyboard will frustrate you.  Again they are 1/3 height and serve a dual purpose via a manual toggle switch.Delete Key not on an outside row:  Again if you use "DEL" you can't easily find it by touch.  Although it is big is nestled between other keys.MAGNETS:OK sure it is nice that there are "weak" magnets to hold the battery covers in place.  However I'm using the mouse on a desk pad from IKEA and it took me a few days to realize that the reason the mouse was so hard to move was because of the bleed through magnetic attraction between the mouse and my desk pad.  So I had to buy a mouse pad in order to be able to move the mouse easily.So you give up some ease of use for the convenience of wireless.  If I was not so lazy I would return it and keep looking.I'm sure I'll replace it eventually.
5,I bought two sets. Sometimes connectivity is not great but honestly great product.
4,Only complaint about the product is the USB fob.  The first one I ordered worked great until the fob received physical damage which is my fault.  However it could not be replaced as a separate part so I had to purchase a complete second new keyboard and mouse.  Even though  the damage was my fault it would have been nice to just buy a replacement.
1,This is such a poor design and incredibly wastefulKeyboard is okay. Nothing extraordinary. The problem is the USB receiver. DO NOT LOSE THIS RECEIVER. If you do you are in a double jeopardy. Not only do you have to go through the excruciating Microsoft service center but also receive a brusque reply that you will have to throw your shiny $115 product into the trash because the keyboard is paired with a unique receiver. You are betting your $115 not on the keyboard but mostly on the inch long gizmo(see the photo) which has a propensity to get lost esp if you are using a laptop and have to unplug it quite a bit. This is such a poor design and incredibly wasteful.If you lose the receiver Microsoft does not replace it at all. I called up Microsoft service center because I thought I lost my receiver. They put me on hold to contact the keyboard team and then the line got disconnected FIVE times. I had to go through the process FIVE times before I could coax out the keyboard/peripheral team's direct number. The rep who answered brusquely told me that they will not replace anything despite the fact that my keyboard is only 2 months old. I still have the warranty but that applies only if your receiver is broken. Basically if you are unfortunate enough to misplace the teeny tiny receiver you have to throw out the $100+ product into the trash because the receiver is uniquely paired to the keyboard. Such a terrible policy and the customer service was so awful. They can apparently make exceptions (I told them that I was a student I had just bought this and cannot afford to throw this out) but the rep told me that I had to throw it out and I don't qualify to be an exemption. Thankfully I found the receiver stuck behind my desk but I was horrified by how the entire expensive set is tied to an irreplaceable inch long gizmo. Such a poor design. Don't buy this product. If you do treat the receiver like it is made of gold.
5,Iy was a gift and the giftee likes it very much!
1,UPDATE 8/24/2018My cleaning service threw away the receiver that I left on my desk. I bring my laptop home nightly but leave the receiver in my office since I broke one before. Microsoft warranty doesn't cover accidents caused by cleaning crews so we are screwed. Microsoft won't replace the keyboard and they can't sell us another receiver and they can't pair the receiver with my old keyboard. What I'm trying to say is this is a great product made by a sh!tty company.I used to love this setup. It took some getting used to a lot of missed keys and backspacing but after 6 months I'm decent at typing on it. (Decent meaning I'm not great at typing but I can do a decent job now and it at least sounds like I can type even though 90% of my keystrokes are the backpace button). I like the large ergonomic mouse and my wrist feels much better when compared to working on my Macbook keyboard and touch pad.Negatives: I left my USB receiver in my laptop one night put the computer into my laptop bag and broke the dongle in half. Microsoft would not replace the dongle and instead made me send the entire setup back to Amazon and get a replacement through Amazon.6 months later my mouse does not function properly. I have cleaned the mouse and replaced the batteries but it is very slow to respond and I can't do basic things like highlight text. Example: I try to navigate to the text but the pointer jumps to the bottom of the screen. I then slowly move back toward the text and it jumps too far up the screen. Then I slowly move the mouse down the screen and nothing happens.The annoying thing is it only happens sporadically and never when our sysadmin is watching.The keyboard occasionally craps out too. It will miss keystrokes and respond very slowly. The mouse acts up daily and the keyboard acts up 1x a week.I like the design and my wrist feels better but I can't spend >$160 a year on keyboards
5,I got my first ergonomic kb in college and have had one variety or another ever since.  This is by far my favorite iteration.  It's sleek it's stylish and most importantly it's comfortable.... so much so i've become rather dependent on it and when I try to use a non-ergonomic kb at university I end up making many mistakes because they are so unnatural.  I have owned this one for over a year and am still very pleased I purchased it.  The mouse was a little strange at first but after a while it's shape makes sense.  I have changed the batteries in the mouse maybe two times now.  Have not had to change the batteries on the kb or number pad.  The feedback you get from the keys is great the mouse is great starts to warn you about a week before the batteries die.  Easy to clean.  About once a week I take a disinfecting wipe to it.  Cleans up well.  Durable.  And very striking in the looks department.  I would buy it again and again and again.
5,Fantastic keyboard for so many reasons: It works well as a lap keyboad I often throw it in my lap while I am working for a more ergonomic position. The cushion feels great and the angle works wonders on my hands. The mouse immediately felt chunky and strange but once I started to use it I realized that it was what I needed. The positioning angle of the mouse alleviates a lot of stress on my right hand.I have not yet replaced the batteries and I have been using it for over 6 months moderate to heavy usage. The number keypad is amazing since its separate however the battery did die in that unit after 5 months. Overall a great price for a great unit. I highly recommend.Con: the only con is the packaging. In an effort to save space and money they positioned the mouse imporperly in the box and it rubs and removes part of the rubber. I returned the first set for a replacement. The second set only had minor wear and I decided to keep it. It does not affect usage at all - just cosmetic.
5,I thought I would not like the gap in the middle of the keyboard or the separate numbers pad but I was wrong.  The gap is benign -- I do not notice it at all when using the keyboard.  It is nice to have a separate key pad because it makes the primary keyboard more compact and it is handy when I need it which frankly isn't often.
5,Ordered new and it was exactly what I ordered sort of. Appeared new still had protective tape around the keyboard edges and num pad however the bottom of the mouse surface was scratched and looked to be a used product.  For this reason it gets 3/5 stars.I got this to replace one (same model) I had previously but beware: if you clean it-don’t let it get wet. The keyboard needed to be cleaned during an office floor relocation so I took the opportunity to clean it being careful of the moisture yet it still ceased to function at my new desk. The keys on the right side stopped responding (yes it was already cleaned of debris/etc).Since this kind of keyboard only works with the fob it ships with I can’t just replace the keyboard and had to buy a new set unless I wanted to use a 2nd fob. I will utilize the old mouse with my laptop.
3,When package came it was perfect but I noticed that the product box inside had been retaped shut. Upon opening the product box all batteries were installed and you could tell it had been used. I was under the understanding that it was new.
5,After several months of use I couldn't be happier with this set.KeyboardYes it took a little time to get used to but it is now natural to me and feels very relaxed.I wasn't sure I would use the riser but I prefer it that way now.Occasionally I set the keyboard on my lap without the riser for change of pace and it works well.MouseREALLY like the mouse the handshake position is very comfortable.I use it 8hrs a day and I have noticed a lot less stress.The magnetic battery cover is super easy to use and clean.The back button under the thumb is hard to live without now that I use it.(you kind of have to pinch your thumb and pinky together to get a good press on it)The Windows key I have never used even once.KeypadI thought that I would probably toss this in the drawer when I bought the set but I find myself using it all the time.It's like having a calculator sitting on your desk out of the way.I pull it out when I need it.  A few times per day.
5,It is more convenient to use compared the flat board on the computer and my hands are not aching
3,Design definitely provides protection against wrist injury however even though I am an excellent typist I find it impossible to type accurately with this keyboard. Now if you are a hunt and peck typist then this keyboard is perfect! But not for someone who types north of 60 wpm! The keys are just laid out inefficiently-many of the keys are too small and also too close together so I am ALWAYS hitting the wrong keys. You MUST be looking at the keyboard and essentially hunt and peck to avoid making mistakes. But that said I will continue to use this setup because the keyboard is the perfect size for my desk and I never suffer wrist fatigue and the mouse and separate numeric keypad make it a joy to use.I do really love the mouse and the separate numeric keypad is not only cool but also amazingly convenient and all this without any wires. I like that the mouse has a convenient Windows 8.1 button to swap effortlessly between the charms menu and the familiar Windows 7 desktop.If I do ever need to type a long letter or email I will either grab my iPhone with SwiftKey for easy word predictions or I will just type on my wonderful keyboard on my HP Spectre laptop to which I have my Microsoft keyboard combination wirelessly attached. I hope this review has been helpful.
4,The Good:* Keyboard is super comfortable. Keys are responsive.* Separate numeric keypad works really nicely. Inclusion of a Calculator button and a backspace was really smart.* Mouse is comfortable.* Switch to permanently set the top row of buttons back to Fn keys is very convenient.* The magnetic battery covers are fantastic. No more prying on a flimsy piece of plastic when replacing batteries.The Bad:* Coming from the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 I had become used to the prev/next buttons for navigating code in Visual Studio. I really feel the lack of that.* It wasn't very straightforward mapping the thumb button on the mouse to be the Win button in Windows 7.* No way I've found to remap left/right side clicks of scrollwheel to be prev/next when browsing the web.Other Thoughts:* Still getting used to the far right section of the keyboard where Home/End/Delete/Pgup/Pgdn live. It could maybe have been laid out better but I'm not sure HOW.
3,I bought this for probably the same reason that most people buy an ergonomic keyboard; my wrist hurt when I typed. The first good news is that the shape of the keyboard works very well to relieve strain on my wrist. The pain has steadily diminished  over the last three weeks. The second positive is that when I get properly aligned with the keyboard I can type faster somewhere between 5-10 WPM. That's a great and unexpected benefit. I also like the clicky action of the keys. The number pad is nice to have as I have to run a couple of spreadsheets.On the down side the mouse doesn't work well at all with my Mac Mini. The pointer jumps and the mouse is basically unusable. I've tried setting my system preferences to increase or decrease the tracking speed. No dice. I give the keyboard 4 stars the mouse 1.I've also found that I have to deliberately place my hands on the keyboard and sit directly in front of it. I can't just turn and quick type a few words on an IM or email. This is probably a good thing ergonomically. It improves my posture and forces me to type with proper form. It's just an adjustment I've had to make. Bottom line - I got what I needed for my repetitive use problem and the keyboard seems well made. Too bad about the mouse.
5,I bought two one for work and home and believe this keyboard is much cheaper than hand surgery. In all seriousness it is an excellent design for independent data entry with a 10-key that you can hold in your hand. For quick calculations just hit the calc button on the separate 10-key and get to work. The keyboard is elevated providing a lift for your wrists and encouragement to sit up straight [depending on desk height]. The mouse isn't great. It's over-sized which follows the ergonomic design and keeps your wrist aligned but the back of the mouse is kept on with a weak magnet. Stuff collects in the spaces separating the buttons and the clickers seem to wear after 6 months or so requiring a harder or additional push to click. There are better mouse[es] out there but I tolerate it because all three items are connected to a single USB transceiver. The keyboard and 10-key are great the mouse is tolerable--better than average.
2,I purchased this keyboard/mouse combo as an upgrade to my aging Microsoft Ergonomic Desktop set after many years of faithful service. I like the look and feel of both the mouse and keyboard and quickly got used to the new key design on the keyboard. The programmable buttons on the mouse are great--I really appreciate having a browser-back button at my thumb.Unfortunately I have run into a couple problems--possibly related--with the mouse which will keep me from giving this set a four or five star review. It may well be that I have a defective mouse but I have not been able to reproduce the issue except on my Lenovo X1 laptop which kept me from returning the product. Further the difficulty of obtaining support from Microsoft for mouse and keyboard hardware detracts from my overall opinion of this product. The issue with the mouse is that the scroll wheel does not work consistently (usually not) and seems that it may be sending a scroll signal constantly since certain applications will immediately scroll to the bottom of the page unless I turn off the mouse. The possibly related issue is that the mouse battery seems to last just about two weeks when my old mouse would last months.As an IT professional troubleshooting this type of issues is how I spend a lot of my day and I have gone through every trick in the book. I am running Windows 8.1 fully updated and the latest version of the mouse and keyboard software available from Microsoft. I understand the hardware should be warrantied by Microsoft still and will try again to reach out to them (I believe I need to call them during business hours which will be difficult). If they are able to resolve my issue I will certainly report back here and hopefully have a better rating to give.
5,I purchased this to replace my 15 year old keyboard/mouse combo from Microsoft.  I'm a Linux guy and really dislike the Microsofts...however their hardware is reliable and seems to stand the test of time.Mouse is a bit to get used too but I do like the fit and the offset keyboard is nice.5 stars.
5,I tried this keyboard at a box store (Staple[s]) and knew right away I would be trading in my old keyboard for this one. It was 40 dollars more there than on Amazon and as a prime member I received the keyboard in a day.So why is this so great. I suffered a broken wrist and some tendon and nerve damage in an automobile accident. I have residual pain in my wrist and fingers along with limited range of motion and stiffness. The ergonomic shape of the keyboard allows me to type twice as long without taking a break. That's the main reason. It really works. It will prevent fatigue and wrist / hand pain.Other reasons include: Textile feedback on the keys is smooth and elegant. Battery life is alien like forget changing batteries. The mouse is built for windows 8 and so are the function keys. Because the number pad is separate you can easily center the keyboard in front of you and still have plenty of room for your mouse. You WILL NOT have to learn to retype with this keyboard because of its shape.You won't reget this!
3,The keyboard is great. It's super comfortable and encourages you to use both use hands equally when you type. The laptop type keys are smooth and feel way less cheap and clunky than the Microsoft 4000. If that is worth the price bump for you get this keyboard. Just don't get the mouse.If you have wrist problems this mouse is really heavy and just makes it worse. Maybe if the mouse was wired it would be better but as of now it requires two AA batteries. Without the batteries the mouse is super light but I would still doubt it's usefullness as it is just not responsive enough.It seems to "get caught" when moving. My cheap wired amazon mouse is way lighter and more responsive on any surface than this mouse.If you have really small hands (XS size in gloves) this mouse is a bit big; using the buttons was ok but the scroll wheel was a bit of a reach. I liked the design of the mouse it's just a pity doesn't work well. The keyboard also has a magnitized stand attachment which is cool. The keyboard is worth it if a split laptop key design is what you are looking for. Though I do wish it was wired as well so I don't have to deal with batteries.
5,Was looking for an ergonomic keyboard that was small. This one is sleek and comfy and small. And the mouse is great too
3,My wired keyboard 4000 was getting old and starting to stick so I wanted to try this one. The keyboard looks great the main number and letter keys feel good and are easy use. The separated keypad is can be positioned which I think is a good option. In my opinion there are a few issues with this keyboard. The keys are a little flat and sometimes get missed when typing very fast. There are no indicator lights such as caps-lock which I have found useful. I type a-lot and use VI extensively the ESC key is very small and hard to depress it has a different feel than the other keys sometimes it doesn't register in VI which gets annoying very fast. The delete home and other keys are in different locations and takes some getting used to. It appears they tried to save space with the keyboard so these keys and the right side of the keyboard are very close together and busy. The function lock key is actually a switch so using advanced functions is somewhat cumbersome. The mouse seems comfortable but I typically use a marble mouse so I don't have much feedback on the mouse. If your a professional and type a lot or use VI you may want to look at the wired version.
5,I absolutely LOVE the keyboard the mouse and the number pad! The keyboard is very comfortable and all of the keys are exactly where I'm used to them being. This was a concern for me as I've seen some keyboards that be it the gap or the angle have keys which are in slightly unusual spots and require a relearning of the muscle memory that I'm accustomed to. Not so in this case to my pleasant surprise.The mouse is fatter than I expected which is a good thing. My wrist can rest on it in an elevated position - super comfy - and I can move it without the back of my hand ever touching the desk/mouse pad (I don't have one of those cool mouse pads with the gel support). This is the exact reason I wanted the mouse. The rest was an added bonus.The number pad ... meh it's a number pad. The calculator button is handy even though I'm not an accountant.
4,This is the second time around that I have bought this product and the only reasons that I really hate it is because the USB dongle which was broken in the last on I had with in the back of a laptop Logitech makes such a compact strong dongle in comparison. But the good parts are the keyboard feels like they used my hand to lay out the keys its very natural the detach number pad make you do magic in with programs such as excel and the hotkey calculator is also fantastic ( wish when you hit back the cal key it minimize) as for the mouse the feeling is perfect for my hands love the feeling. just wish that we can get replacement dongles for the USB
4,This keyboard feels very comfortable. I like having a separated numpad which I I do not use often. I must add that I got used to it quickly but reading other reviews it seems that it varies from person to person.There are few cons to mention:- the function keys (F1 F2...) are not chiclet-like they feel more rigid to the touch. In general this does not bother me except for the escape key which I use often in VIM.- the mouse wheel is inclined and sometimes I roll it in the wrong angle due to being used to other mouses (I think this is a matter of getting used to it).- the '0' key in the numpad does not always work properly (in a mechanical sense) specially if you use your thumb to press it.
4,I love this keyboard for its comfort level its looks and its quietness.  The separate number pad is nice though I rarely use it.  It pretty much has to go above my mouse pad so that my mouse isn't far from the keyboard which means I have to reach further to use it.  I would give this product 5 stars if it were possible to pair a replacement mouse with the existing dongle or vice versa.  The mouse WILL die long before the keyboard does.  We shouldn't have to live with 2 dongles.
5,El combo de teclado y mouse es de muy buena calidad cómodo y de una apariencia agradable.
4,I purchased this set based on a couple of reviews and on its sleek modern appearance. (I've been using ergonomic keyboards of one kind or another for nearly 20 years ever since I saw one of the first Microsoft Natural keyboards on the desk of a colleague and I've been an evangelist ever since. Yes it takes a bit of retraining but once that's over you'll wonder why you ever put up with a "flat" keyboard.) I like they feel of the keys and the overall shape is very natural and relaxing. I actually use the 10-key pad and I like the separate unit that can be placed out of the way when not needed. The mouse (although I prefer a trackball) is very comfortable although it would be nice to have a couple of extra buttons to program.The unit I received had a flaw that necessitated its return: The keyboard went though a pair of AAA batteries in just under 48 hours!
5,I love this keyboard and am using it now for this review.  I am a 60 wpm typist with large hands and the other keyboards always felt "dinky" for me.  I'd used the Microsoft Ergo Keyboard the one which dramatically separates the hands for years but when it died I decided to try this one.  I highly recommend this for the ergo feel for the "click-feel" when you depress a key for the two-space-bar configuration and for the separate keypad for numerals.  There is a built-in wrist-rest which feels great though it has some suede-like material; it can be difficult to clean if you spill or smudge it.  Battery life is tremendous as well.  The accompanying mouse is much more bulbous than other Microsoft mouses/meeces/mice and takes some getting used-to.  The mouse has a key for alternately accesing the Windows key on the keyboard.  I've gotten accustomed to the mouse but that took a while.  I think I prefer other mouse units but I wouldn't consider another keyboard after using this one.  Great product.
2,I purchased this product in March of 2019.Some notes on my use: I work at a computer between 50-60 hours a week therefore reliability is key when it comes to a keyboard/mouse set up. Generally I rely on keyboard navigation versus mouse use so although I always have my mouse on hand I'd say I use it approx. 30% of the time I'm utilizing my system.This set up has functioned very well for my use for over one year. I enjoy the keyboard set up and mouse shape (neither are overly aggressive for ergonomic options which I appreciate). Had you asked me 2 months ago I would have given it a five star review and have even recommended it to others.However over the past month or so the left mouse button has begun faltering requiring multiple click attempts to achieve any intended command. I have attempted troubleshooting on various different computers USB ports changed batteries etc. and the issue persists. This is a significant enough hardware issue that I will be purchasing a different mouse which is disappointing considering the price of the set up and (what I would consider) not overly excessive use of the mouse.
5,I love these Microsoft ergonomic keyboards. They are quite a bit too adjust to. But my typing speed once I did went from 50 words/min to nearly 100 words/min with less errors. The split off number pad is great because I can position it away if I don't need it. Or right where it's comfortable for my hand to use. Also great if you're a lefty and want it on the left.
1,I'm a pretty capable keyboarder and have used a great many HIDs including ergonomic keyboards so I was astonished to find that this undeniably attractive product completely derailed my touch-typing ability.  I'd be the first to acknowledge that I have small hands -- so shoot me I'm a girl -- but I wasn't offered a pink model and so had to make do with the seemingly gender-neutral black model.  Who knew?!?To use this keyboard I'd have to fall back on the hunt-and-peck approach; it's impossible for me to reach often-used keys while keeping my hands in position over the home row.  I'd actually have to move my entire hand to hit a number of keys which seems less than ergonomic to this former power typist (and former Microsoft enthusiast).  Just to make sure I wasn't having some weird out-of-body experience I asked my daughter (a BS in Computer Science and an MA in Product Design and an exquisite pianist also a girl) to assess the operational fitness of the keyboard and was relieved to see her struggle (and ultimately fail) to reach commonly used keys too.  Vindication is sweet but as it turns out pricey.If you're able to play Brahms comfortably without mobilizing the neighborhood cats this keyboard is for you.  For the rest of us ordering this device is an expensive gamble because Amazon doesn't consider its being unsuited to keyboarding a legitimate reason for its return.  Be advised that if you have normal human even *gasp* female hands you're risking either incurring a hefty return fee or becoming the proud owner of a very large paperweight.  Alternatively you might look at it as an investment in a moderately usable mouse and an extremely responsive numeric keypad.  Or you might consider a Logitech keyboard which never disappoints.  I recommend the wireless solar-powered model ($49.99) which is less expensive than this item functions extremely well and looks great on any work surface -- despite its not coming in pink.As for me I think I'll donate my keyboard to a nonprofit that's staffed only by men.
4,To echo other folks the function keys and function lock are kind of weird (but it only really matters if you're a developer). Mine don't stick like some have mentioned but I just don't see the point of making them more like buttons than keys.Otherwise I LOVE everything else about the keyboard. Perfect shape/curve/dip not gigantic generally a really smart design. Love the external 10-key. I have one at work and home and just plug in the USB when I'm there store it in the mouse otherwise.I wanted to get the mouse included so that I'm only using one USB drive for all this but I don't love the mouse. The wheel isn't a smooth scroll which causes strain on the top of the right hand. It's also quite tall without being fully sideways so it doesn't really seem that ergonomic at all. I wear wrist supports so it's not that big of a deal.
5,Best keyboard I have used. I have 3 of these now for home and office. My hands are rested and the mouse works flawlessly to not hurt my hands. I suffer from my fingers becoming sticky when I close my hands. But I can say that even though I have this problem I can continue to type easily with this keyboard without feeling tired nor strained. I'm usually in front of the computer for 12 hours a day 5 days a week. The keys are easy on my fingers and the mouse feels like my hand is in a resting position. I work a lot of hours (engineer) and my hands never feel tired with this keyboard and mouse set.Note: I have used other ergonomic keyboards (more expensive ones) and have found that this one works best for the time I spend working.   Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Wireless Desktop Keyboard and Mouse
3,Love the overall layout of the keyboard and its usage does feel much better from an ergonomic perspective.Why 3 star?The left shift key only works about half of the time (if your finger doesn't hit it dead center it doesn't register... I'm 6'2" and my pinky finger lands on the edge of the key.  This design should never have made it into production.  Haven't decided yet... this may be what sends it back.The FN toggle is a terrible design (at a very minimum they should have also included a one-time version as well... like every other keyboard ever made).  I've just turned it off entirely and used auto hot key to create my own shortcuts for media using the "apps key" (between alt and control on the right side) for media (volume up down pause/play next/prev track... that's all I really use):AppsKey::Send {Media_Play_Pause}AppsKey & Left::Send {Media_Prev}AppsKey & Right::Send {Media_Next}AppsKey & Up::Send {Volume_Up}AppsKey & Down::Send {Volume_Down}There is nothing ergonomic about the mouse- it is incredibly high which tilts your wrist up more than a normal mouse.  There's no back/forward button either... save the $ and go with a real vertical mouse which actually does alleviate some wrist strain.
2,I purchased this keyboard / mouse / numeric pad because I liked the feel of the mouse and the option to move my numeric pad anywhere on my desk when I'm stuck doing bookkeeping.  Here's the deal with the keyboard.  This is my second purchase.  I started having the lagging keystroke issue about two weeks into using the keyboard.  First I thought it was a battery issue.  When I went to change the batteries I noticed that one of the batteries did not sit firmly in its slot.  This made the contact sporadic and thus the keystroke lag.  I cut a small piece of metal and slipped it onto the negative side of the battery to create a tight fit and now the keyboard works fine.  I'll keep an eye on the battery to make sure I haven't created a hazard but the culprit seems to be a loose battery.  The spring supposedly holding the battery in place just doesn't stay tightly engaged against the battery.  Poor manufacturing and stupid design.  What's wrong with plain old exposed springs that we're all used to seeing in battery compartments?UPDATE 3/15/20:  It's now been almost a year and my "fix" has held up.  I haven't had a problem with key stroke lag.  When I replaced the battery on the separate numeric pad I used a small piece of cardboard against the battery; it works much better.  Really dumb battery compartment design.
5,Having used the previous Microsoft ergonomic 4000 keyboard I knew that this would be a right purchase. I was correct. I was hesitant to spend $80 on a keyboard but I have RSI leading to carpel tunnel syndrome and even the 4000 was starting to cause problems due to the key press resistance. The keys on this are much like my Macbook Air and it is a dream to use. Even the mouse is awesome. For the last 10 years I have used a Wacom tablet as a mouse since regular mice kill my hands. Somehow Microsoft has made a keyboard mouse combo that is easy to use easy to push easy on your hands and easy on the budget. I even like the calculator being separate so I can sit back in my chair and calculate. All of that plus the fact that all of it is wireless... Just pure heaven in computing.You should buy it if you want to help avoid RSI. I use this keyboard in conjunction with Dragon Naturally Speaking and my hands have never been so pain free!
2,I purchased this keyboard and mouse combination to replace the older 4000 model. My main motivation in purchasing was the removal of the number pad from the main keyboard and a smaller keyboard in general (all while maintaining the ergonomic design).The keyboard met my expectations on what I wanted. It's small and I don't have the wasted desk space for the number pad. The keys are easy to push and not terribly loud. The space bar is now split across two keys which should help those who had a hard time pressing it on the older model.However there are several drawbacks from the previous 4000 model. Many have already mentioned these in previous reviews but I'll repeat them here:1. There's no standard Fn key. There's only a toggle switch on the keyboard. As a programmer I use the F1-12 keys often but still like to adjust the music volume. Combining these media controls with the function keys and changing the Fn to a switch instead of key is very annoying.2. The function keys along the top are not keys. They are buttons. This is really a minor issue except for problem #3...3. The function keys sometimes stick. Sometimes I'll hit F5 to refresh a page and the page continually refreshes until I give the F5 button a good hit again. As a programmer I use these keys daily and this keyboard's function keys have become so unpredictable I have just had to avoid them. I'm looking to get a different keyboard now.4. I have no gripes about the mouse's function. However it is larger than most and I have knocked it completely off my desk several times when reaching over for it. I'm sure I'll get used to its size but it still seems large and awkward.
5,Not because the break but because this is now my goto keyboard.  One thing I love is that if you don't use a numeric pad much like me your distance to the mouse is now about 4-6" closer.  I learned typing the old school way on Selectrics and can type numbers just about as fast with the keyboard and don't have to leave my home row position for it.  Now my mouse is just 4" away from home row so much nicer and quicker.  Other than that it has a great feel and response.  I'm no Microsoft software/OS fan-boy but you do have to give them kudos for making some of the best keyboards and mice out there.  I'm typing this review on my FreeBSD workstation and the only thing Microsoft is the human interface devices.  I think this is hands down the best mass produced compact ergo keyboard out there now.
5,I have had this product a couple of months now and find there is a little acclamation. i have had an ergonomic keyboard previous to this one.  Read lots of reviews about this keyboard and decided to order it even though there were some negatives. I actually love this keyboard. i find it very comfortable. I wasn't sure if I would like the split in the numbers pad but I now find it very useful just don't lose it. I think this keyboard is very stylish. Some of the negative reviews cited the mouse. I like this mouse  and find it fits my hand very well other members of my family have said the same. This keyboard and mouse seems to be best suited for people with average size hands it is very form fitting i think hand size would make a difference in comfort level of this product. i found this product to be on the high end of the price range but now that I have it I would purchase it again. Thanks for reading! Have a great day!
5,I changed from mechanical keyboard to this one and never go back. Microsoft is the lead of ergonomic keyboard.
5,It’s the best ergo keyboard for WFH and/office.
5,This is my 4th of these units in about 5 years I've gone thru 2 sets at work and now on my 2nd set at home.  Mouse left click for me fails after about 1.5 to 2 years of heavy use.  Letters may wear off keyboard slightly especially the C and V and other keys.  The ergo aspect is fantastic and works great for my height/desk and various issues.
5,I have been doing transcriptions from home using my MacBook Pro and soon found that I had tremendous pain in my hands from all the use. I did a lot of research and this keyboard seemed to get the best reviews.I've been using it for about 3 weeks now doing transcriptions for hours at a time and the hand fatigue has noticeably decreased. It's sleek and comfortable and I love the separate number keypad.I couldn't find an ergonomic keyboard exclusively for Macs that was anywhere near as affordable as this one. In order to make this keyboard layout more like a Mac's all I had to do was go into Prefs and  switch the "Alt" key to the Apple "Control" key and the "Cntrl" key to "Alt." It works perfectly.I highly recommend this to anyone suffering from carpel tunnel or hand pain or anyone who simply has to spend a lot of time typing.
4,I have been using this set at work for about a year and I am very happy with it.  The resistance of the keys is exactly what I was seeking.  The battery life is very good as my mouse batteries just died after a year of heavy use.  I'm not really a fan of the separate number pad.  I understand that some people may like it and it even seemed like a good idea when I was buying it.  However with my desk setup it tends to be a pain if I have to do anything using the number pad and arrow keys.  My only other small issue is that I can never seem to get the wrist rest completely clean.  Those are small gripes and don't heavily impact my overall opinion of this set.
4,1st one had to be returned.  I have to learn a whole new keyboard which is horrible at my age.  It is quiet though which was my main goal in buying a new keyboard.  Virtually noiseless.  The keys stick a bit on this 2nd one though not often.  I used to type by touch and now have found myself going back to hunt and pecking.  My old keyboard the Microsoft previous ergonomic version was used for about 12 years and it had a bit of a learning curve as well.  Plus it sounded like a M-16 when I got going as I (used) to type at about 60 WPM.  Well it is the best so I'll stick with it.  I tried 4 others after the first one failed then decided to get a replacement.  All of the others are worse.
5,I'm not sure of the actual efficacy of ergonomic keyboards as I have seen studies come out that they actually don't do much. But after getting this my neck pain is gone my wrist pain is gone and my massage therapist has commented on how much more relaxed my neck and shoulders are. The ability to move freely with bluetooth may have a part to do with it as I have a standing desk and while sitting the laptop keyboard puts me in a weird spot. If ergonomic keyboards are just a placebo effect I don't mind at all. I feel a ton better and I have been sleeping better too. Easily the best purchase I have made for my work environment. I saw some complaints about how the mouse is laid out but I really enjoy it. The mouse feels large at first but it lets your hand splay out instead of scrunching up on a tiny mouse.
1,I bought this after reading many positive ratings but I was quite disappointed with this keyboard set so I want to share my experience here. First of all I am a big fan of MS keyboards and mice or MS hardwares in general. I've been using MS ergonomic keyboards for more than a decade (my current favorite is MS natural ergonomic keyboard 4000) and I have been a very happy customer until I got this product.1. There is a well known problem with this desktop set which is the numpad stops working suddenly which may happen one day after one starts using this product or a few weeks (which was my case) or a few months. You can check the MS web page and see many people having trouble with the issue even after getting an exchange to a new one.2. If you are using Vim for your coding this is not the best choice because the ESC key is not a real key but a small button.3. I use OS X Windows 7 and Linux at the same time and because MS does not provide an OS X driver for this keyboard it's a bit of headache to use this for OS X. Not really MS's fault for this issue because they are not saying they support OS X but just wanted to let people know about this. On the contrary MS natural ergonomic keyboard 4000 fully support OS X as far as I am concerned.4. The arrangement of keys are a bit off compared to previous MS ergonomic keyboards. I keep making so many typos.There are certainly good things about this keyboard I like the feeling of key strokes but too many cons prevent me from using this product. I tried several times to make myself like this product but that didn't happen.Thanks to Amazon's excellent customer service I got a refund for my faulty keyboard but now I have to look for another ergonomic Keyboard which is somehow not a common thing these days...
5,I read some other reviews where people didn't like the key setup with the home/delete/ etc. buttons. This doesn't bother me since I don't use those keys much and it is worth the smaller sleeker size in my opinion. I had the Microsoft wireless ergonomic desktop 7000 and even though they look similar this has a totally different feel I have to get used to. Working 8-10 hrs/day on the computer makes ergonomic a must for me. If you are used to a rectangular keyboard it is a big adjustment and for average use as an in between step a set like the sculpt comfort desktop is a happy medium. Having a separate number pad is great for a couple reasons. It pretty much feels like having a stand alone calculator since it has the calculator button on the top to pull of the calculator program. The other reason I like this it helps me type correctly by using the numbers above the homerow instead of cheating and moving my right hand back and forth from the number pad. No complaints from me so far.
4,My end-user loves this set.  This is the business bundle w/ the numeric keypad included.  There is also a consumer version which only gives you the mouse and keyboard but not the number pad.The only issue with this ergonomic set is that you can't replace individual components or add a numeric keyboard (to the consumer version) on the original USB-wireless dongle.  For security reasons Microsoft locks the keys into the dongles at the factory (unlike at least one of their competitors) and they can't be changed later.  So if you make replacements or additions you end up with multiple dongles and they interfere w/ each other unless you have at least the length of the computer between them.
5,I have been using Microsoft Natural Keyboards for 20 years. One of the big issues has always been noise -- perhaps the convex part acts as a resonator and the keys have been clickier than the keyboard coming with the PC. I agree with others that this keyboard is a lot more quiet than the other models I've used over the years. The keys are thinner and the distance your fingers move isn't as great as with other keyboards but I haven't noticed any problems because of that. I use this all day every day with no issues.I like how the tenkey part is separate. I can bring it out when I need it otherwise keeping it off my desk so my keyboard takes up less room.The only problem I have is with the mouse. It is designed for right-hand use and I use the mouse with my left hand usually. It hasn't been enough of an issue for me to care about
3,To ensure the battery lasts a long time the keyboard turns off after ~30 seconds.  If you don't type for ~30 seconds while doing something else such as use the mouse to navigate a page then press a key the first time you press a key it merely turns the keyboard on again.  For example if you type something then use the mouse to research something on the internet then come back to your document to write "for example" only "or example" will be typed so you have to use the Backspace button and re-type it.  The workaround is to hit the "Shift" button before you type anything after a long pause but that is really annoying.  I wish I would have purchased the corded model.
5,I can't say enough good things about my keyboard.  I bought one for work bought one for home and then bought this one for my dad!  It's gone far to alleviate my wrist pain from working on the computer and it's a real pleasure to use.  I enjoy the keypress feel and the wrist rest.  Good response plenty of speed to keep up with my typing and my favorite thing is having the mouse so close -- just like using a laptop keyboard.  Going back to a regular keyboard with a numpad is frankly just painful.I will say that I don't find myself using the numpad too much unless I'm doing my monthly accounting.The only other con is the material of the wrist rest.  For some reason it fades / turns white in the areas of wear making it look dirty/worn at first glance.  But it's so futuristic it still looks cool.Highly recommend!!  Won't use any other keyboard!
3,I ordered this product back in May. I love the feel of this keyboard/mouse set HOWEVER when I received my first set I noticed right out of the box that the responsiveness of the keys on the keypad was lacking. I placed an exchange request to get a new set and received it very quickly. As the months have passed I've had increasing responsiveness issues with this keypad as well. Over the last week or so it's been missing keyed data consistently. Quite frustrating having to go back multiple times during the data entry process to re-enter the information being missed sometimes having to use the row of numbers at the top of the keyboard instead to just get it done. I'm not sure if the keypad's battery is going sour at this point - the specs claim battery life is typically 36 months. There is no indicator on the device to help make that determination. Could be a design flaw considering 2 keypads have had the same issues. I guess my next step will be to order a new battery for the keypad (the keyboard works just fine still) and see if that makes any difference. I will update then.
5,This is my second set in 5 years. Saved my wrists & hands. I have carpal tunnel and Lupus so I needed something to alleviate pain. This did the trick. My only issue when my mouse kicked the bucket I had to buy an entire set because replacing just the mouse wouldn't work with my old keyboard. They're all linked somehow (I'm not a techie so I dunno the appropriate term lol). In the long run though it was worth it to get a new set.
5,I just got this keyboard today but already I can tell that it has several features that I was looking for.Pros:-  Microsoft got the ergonomic design right.  I also have an older Microsoft ergonomic keyboard and this one fits just as well.-  Key feel.  I really like the softer key presses on this computer.  This is the quietest keyboard I've ever owned.  I couldn't even use my last ergonomic keyboard in the office because of the space bar.  This one is great.  I'm no expert on keyboard technologies but the keys feel like a laptops-  The look.  This isn't as nerdy as other ergonomic keyboards.  It looks a lot better than I thought it would.-  The battery covers being held on by magnets are a nice touch.  Easy to remove.Cons:-  The keys are spaced slightly further apart then I'd prefer.  That's not major tho.I'd recommend this product to anyone who can type using the home row.
4,Very comfortable! I do a lot of design work so that means a lot of mouse use. My hand would cramp and my wrist would ache with my old mouse. Not so with this one! The keyboard is also very stylish and comfortable and I really like that the keypad is detached so I can move it around to suit my desk. One note is that the keyboard wrist pad discolors from use almost immediately but doesn't seem to degrade further after that. On my black pad I have two gray wrist marks from my hands. The overall benefits outweigh that one flaw for me though but if something like that would bother you it's not something you can wash off or fix as far as I can tell.
4,I've always used split key style ergonomic keyboards ever since the first Microsoft/Logitech ones came out in the 90's. This is by far the most elegant design. I've been using this keyboard for over 6 months now and for me it did take a bit of adjustment due to the relatively shallow key travel (for a desktop keyboard) the layout of home/end keys and the slightly further spacing of the keys. My biggest gripe is with the function keys. They're small and tend to get stuck easily if your depress the edge. A minor nuisance since I don't use them that frequently but I do use F5 F2 and shift F7 somewhat regularly.The mouse is large comfortable and tracks nicely. I'd highly recommend this keyboard considering Logitech no longer makes the split style keyboard. I may even buy a second set in case this get discontinued.
3,Mixed bag review for me. Keyboard felt good and was getting used to it. Mouse also felt comfortable and liked it. Unfortunately I just could not get used to the 10 key being a separate pice of equipment. Easy to use but at my work from home set up I was just not able to get the 10 key in comfortable position. 2 out of 3 is not bad but since it's a bundle I ended up returning it for something that I hope can be a much more comfortable option.
4,Good ergonomy and battery life for the keyboard. Nice feeling and material. Only issue with the mouse: not so great battery life (don't forget to switch it off as soon as you're not using it or it runs out rather quickly) and no extra customizable buttons except for the scroll. Overall very happy with the keyboard but I rather stick with my old mouse.
5,So I haven't gotten used to the mouse kinda wish I would have bought just the keyboard since the mouse is connected though the same dongle and now I use a different mouse but the keyboard has this nice raiser that's magnetic and to get used to the position of the keys I took it off so it was flatter after a week of that I knew it well and when its on the base it does just what it's supposed to. I work at a a surgery center and see carpal tunnel's all week long I'm hoping this prevents me from being there and I think it's a help. The number pad I can see how they didn't want to float it on the end being a separate keypad is a little odd and has some lag probably not to burn up the battery but the keyboard is worth it all.
4,I do like this keyboard I like the shape and layout of it.  I do wish that the keypad was attached instead of on its own it always seems to get moved around and not where I need it to be.  The mouse is BIG so if you have small hands that may be a hindrance to you.  The only other complain I have is the size of the USB receiver i unusually long the Logitech ones barely stick out from the USB slot this one is probably close to 3/4" so don't put it on the front USB slot of your computer you'll break it right off.
4,About three months ago the "y" key top popped off.  Now the "p" key has to be hit extra hard.  The warranty is for 3 years.  I've owned it for one.  Amazon will not take it back.  20 minutes of fruitless searching show no place on Microsoft to send it to and no procedures for sending.  Until this is resolved one star.  If no one contacts me within 10 days to do something about this I will buy a non Microsoft keyboard.  If I hear nothing with thirty days I will make a YouTube video of a train running over and slicing this keyboard in half.  I looked in vain for places that would repair it. OK help is on the way thanks to other customer's review.
5,I love this! It’s comfortable and has been working great for some time. I don’t really use the number pad but I like that you can detach it and it doesn’t extend the keyboard. I have one for the office and one at home I like it so much. Keys are comfortable and responsive. One thing to keep in mind if you lose the dongle it comes with you can’t connect any of it. It’s like losing the keys to your car per Microsoft. That said it’s very comfortable quiet and I really enjoy it.
4,The keyboard is excellent. It has a shallow travel but a nice response like a comfortable laptop keyboard. I use the optional riser to give the keyboard a negative tilt (hands slope down). I'm not a touch typist but this keyboard is forcing me to finally learn. I ue it both on a PC and a Mac. It works fine for both so far.The mouse on the other hand is not that great. It forces you to tilt your hand a bit for comfort but it's a bit too small for my palm. So I end up using my wrist too much to move it rather than my arm as one should to minimize wrist movement. I don't use the keypad but it's nice that they remove it because you can put the mouse closer to your keyboard and minimize stretching at the elbow.
4,Perhaps I should have only purchased the keyboard but for only $20 it seemed the mouse might come in handy.I'm a left handed mouse or trackball user and usually have no issues with mice...  however this one is designed exclusively for right handed users and is really not usable at all in the left hand.  It's also very TALL and in my view not very ergonomic even in the right hand... it's about 3" high and 1" would work much better. I wish they had a left hand option or an option to get a 2nd dongle so the mouse could be used by someone else on another system.While the keyboard is very nice the spacing of keys is quite wide - much wider than any keyboard I've used in the last 35 years. Even with this I would buy the keyboard again.
5,If you are a programmer this is the keyboard for you. Be careful with the keyboard mouse and the usb connector. Do not drop the mouse or bend the usb connector as several others have mentioned. I tried several others and returned them only to buy this keyboard again.
2,Bottom line for me great design wins but a couple of major flaws leave me teetering on returning the item.  I do a lot of manuscript editing so I mouse a lot (actually trackball).  For that work the separate number pad is a big win so I can have my trackball closer to my typing hands.  The design is also elegant and cool and yes I think that there is value in that.  The other big win for me is that they finally have reverse tilt the fatal flaw with previous-gen ergos.  However the reverse tilt then highlights for me what is the biggest flaw of this product the palm rest.  It's just too shallow for my (admittedly larger than average) hands.  After a few hours on it I have a sore spot on my left wrist from where this thing hits it.  I'm hoping I can get an extra thick gel wristpad to put in front of it for long typing stints.  I was surprised to see that the wristpad on this is actually very similiar in size/depth to the old-gen ergo so it really is just an issue of having the tilt fixed/correct (if I forward tilt my old one it's just about as bad).  On the new one however I do also see that the pleather is going to wear through on this contact spot already showing wear after only 2 days use [sic].  A final note for parents this makes clever use of magnets for battery covers and tilt appendage doing away with those easily breakable traditional tabs.  It does however mean easier access to the battery for curious little fingers and greater likelihood of the covers themselves walking off.
5,My right index finger had been numb from the tip to 3/4s the way up for about 2 months.  I worried it was from the position my right wrist was in from using a traditionally shaped wireless mouse.  Within a couple of weeks of using the new ergo-mouse/keyboard combo...I realized one day there was no numbness at all.  And I could feel I was not straining to keep my hands in position on either the keyboard or mouse and the tension was off my forearm and elbow.The one downside (this is not a huge complaint) is that because of the key configuration it does take some time to get back into a typing rhythm.
5,Keyboard: Amazing keyboard. The split curved design is incredibly comfortable. The way your hands rest on it is completely natural. The palm rest is a soft fabric which absorbs sweat (yes I have sweaty palms). The key action is sharp and crisp. It almost reminds me of the old school Thinkpad keyboards before they went to the Chiclet design. Keypad is a separate wireless unit which makes the footprint very compact but still gives you the advantages of a full sized keyboard. I have had no problems with keys sticking that I've seen mentioned in previous reviews.Keypad: The way the keypad is split off in a separate unit makes it very space efficientMouse: Windows button is a little awkward and it is heavier than most mice I'm used to. But the design is again very natural and comfortable. Not a huge fan of the glossy finish or the positioning of the windows button. Also wish there was another secondary button. Despite all this it's still an excellent and comfortable mouse.
3,I love the keyboard.  Nice spacing good feel and return not to loud and the wrist pad the the right size.  Mouse is great also nice action and quiet. Been loving it for a year and a couple of months but the USB dongle just...  died.  Quit caput. Won't be recognized in any windows machine (I tried three). The expensive keyboard combo is now just worthless because there is no way to tie the functioning hardware to a computer anymore.Alas I can't find a better wireless ergonomic design for less than a bazillionty dollars so maybe just have to live with buying this one again?  So sad.
5,My wrists were achy and sore at the end of every day until I got this keyboard. It took a little adjustment (a week or so). I haven't tested myself yet but I feel like I can type faster than before. The only drawback and this is super minor is the material used as the wrist rest on the main keyboard. It gets oily and dirty easy. However it's very easy to clean with mild soap and a wet rag. Makes it look new again. I haven't had any problem at all with it and I use it 8-10 hours per day every weekday. So far I think I have changed the batteries once. This was like after almost a year of use. I highly recommend spending the little extra you will pay on the keyboard mouse combination as you will not regret it.
4,Is a good product dnt take me wrong but is too small I was trying to replace the Microsoft Ergonomic 4000. I little bigger will be perfect.
5,I'm a PC user but I also use a Mac Air laptop for work and when I use it at home I wanted an ergonomic keyboard because the Mac Air keyboard isn't great so I decided to give this a try because I use a Microsoft Natural 4000 for my desktop but needed something more compact when working in my front room. I love it. Ergonomic yet compact without feeling cramped. All 3 components use the same USB controller that stores inside the battery compartment under the mouse for convenience when not in use. The mouse's battery cover is magnetized and so is the optional keyboard attachment that lets you change the keyboard angle. Chiclet style keys that I have no problem using. I never use the separate number pad so that's stored away saving desk space. So we'll designed. And I bought it on Amazon (Prime shipping baby!) for $70 where Frys sold it for $140 and Best Buy $109.A great buy for my money.
3,I really love the looks of the keyboard and the separate number pad.  Mouse works great and is comfortable.  But for me there were issues  I could not get over....1. The space bar.  I'm used to hitting the front edge of the space bar.  This keyboard is non-responsive to space bar pressed all the way down if pressed on the front edge.  This leads to too many typos for me.2. The position of the enter key is too far away for my pinky to hit consistently.  I have not had this problem with previous Microsoft ergo keyboards.  This again leads to typos.3. I'm not a fan of the new low-profile keys.  Its much easier for my hands to navigate on the older fullsize keys without having to look down at the keyboard.So for these reasons I've decided to return this set.  I will be getting the Microsoft Ergonomic wired keyboard 4000.  Too bad they don't make that model wireless.  I may order the mouse alone separately as the mouse included here is comfy and responsive.
3,I've got two of these. One I bought for work one I have in my home office. (I actually had a work provided one at my previous employer) So that makes three over all of these I've had. My old one and my one at work are amazing zero complaints. The one I just purchased for my home office is a mixed bag. The keyboard and number pad work fine but it's the mouse. Several times an hour it just goes very unresponsive I move the cursor it does nothing just sits there then jolts around as if it has a bad signal.It's not batteries I just replaced the ones that came with it with brand new ones just in case but that didn't help.It's not my computer because I use this same computer at work and it works fine with my mouse there.It's not the distance from the dongle not only does my laptop sit further away at work and act just fine but at home it's maybe 3 feet away from the mouse. Not sure if I just got a bad unit or what.
4,I've had previous Microsoft ergo keyboards and this keyboard is pretty awesome. First I like the styling. Dare I say it looks much better than plane white and flat mac keyboard at my other desk. The curvature of the keys out of the box worked great for me and it does come with another piece to elevate the keyboard if you need it. I also liked the mouse very much because you operate it in the same angle as you type so to me it feels more natural. Have a calculator button on the separate keypad is a bonus for me and saves me useless key strokes.The only downside for me is that you need to have a dongle to use it. I don't travel much anymore so it says in my USB port however if you do travel I'd keep the USB dongle in your dock.
4,I have been using this set at my office for almost a year and just recently bought one for home as well. Unfortunately the latest one stopped working after about a week. I believe something went wrong with the USB dongle. Nonetheless I absolutely love this keyboard and mouse. I have had chronic ergonomic problems with my wrist and fingers and switching to this keyboard definitely helped.But one other thing I am absolutely fan of is Amazon customer service. I called them and let them know about the issue and they promptly ordered a replacement and guaranteed next day delivery. I have read multiple complaints over the internet from people trying to get a replacement Microsoft and it just amazes me how different the customer experience is with the two companies headquartered in the same city.
3,The typing action on these keyboards is fantastic and weird-looking mouse really is ergonomic seems to help with RSI and didn't take too long to get used to. Now I like it. My only gripe is that if you're doing anything that involves a lot of use of the control keys (home end pgup pddn cursor keys--I'm a programmer but anybody doing tons of spreadsheet or text editing work would be in the same boat) this keyboard is probably going to slow you WAY down for a while and take some getting used to. After a couple of months I'm finally getting to the point where I'm comfortable with the new arrangement although I seriously doubt that I will EVER be as fast on this keyboard as on one with the normal key layout.For the life of me I don't understand why keyboard makers keep wanting to change the arrangement of the control keys. Leave them alone already. They work just fine where they've been for 30 years with a little space around them so you can easily move your hand over and find them without taking your eyes off the screen so you don't have to re-train yourself to find the keys by touch. For crying out loud.
3,Love the separate number pad. Saves space on my keyboard drawer. The key board does not have any provisions to raise the top of board to angle it.  The mouse with its sometimes being hard to press left switch and sometimes requiring a second press to activate will never make it as a gaming mouse. The size of the mouse makes it hard to hold while trying to spin the wheel.  Size of keyboard and it is wireless still makes it a keeper.
3,I have had the device for over 2 years.  Soft keys and overall feel of mouse and keyboard is excellent.  Compact design but still ergonomic great.  Separating the 10 key with keyboard was a great idea.  Disappointed in the mouse life as the scroll stopped working.  I followed several tutorials to repair or fix without any resolution to the non-scroll.  I am now going to be required to purchase a new mouse but I will keep the keyboard and 10 key.
4,Great keyboard but took longer than I thought to get assimilated to the shape and layof
5,If I could give this 6 stars I would! First of all it's beautiful! Second the wrist rest is large so you can really rest your hands on it. Third the keys are very responsive. The mouse is great and takes about 30 seconds to get used to! I think the magnetic battery lids and the magnetic keyboard lift are pure genius! I haven't figured out how to use the number pad but I never use the number pad on a keyboard anyhow so I don't really care. BEST OF ALL because the number pad is separate the keyboard is fairly small AND the center of the keyboard can be lined up with the center of the monitor. And even with the keyboard lift it's still not too large to fit into the drawer of my desk (which opens up as a keyboard tray) - that was a problem with the Microsoft 4000 ergonomic keyboard I had before. As you can tell I LOVE THIS KEYBOARD!!
4,this does take some getting used to. the look and feel are very premium but the mouse has the annoying gloss plastic on it. the keyboard keys feel light and responsive and the way everything like the battery covers and keyboard clip are magnetic is a nice touch as well.If you're going to buy this definitely buy from amazon and not through Microsoft because it's ridiculously priced. I've read about issues with the dongle and while it's larger than the dongle you get get with logitech devices it's not exactly a deal breaker if you're using this on a desktop pc.Overall i enjoy this and it's a nice upgrade from having a wired keyboard.
4,REALLY like this unit... it's very well built I've spilled coffee on it twice now and it didn't even flinch.  The mouse is incredibly comfortable.  I'm deducting one star for the keyboard size... I have large hands and the bottom left corner rests directly against the outside of my left palm.  I wish they made it slightly larger but otherwise it's a great device.  Also the separate number pad is WAY more ergonomic... it allows you to place the G and H keys directly in front of you while keeping the mouse well within reach.  On units with the number pad built in there's always a trade off... if the mouse is easily accessable the keyboard is skewed off-left (or vise-versa). This is a much better setup.
5,This is the best ergonomic keyboard I've tried so far. I bought it for the first time 3 years ago and can never go back. (I only purchased it again because I left it behind when I moved not because it stopped working.) The slanted sides make it a little awkward to type at first but after a week or two you get used to it and your wrists will thank you. The separate number keyboard allows you to put it in a convenient spot which I love.This is the first time I've used this mouse and so far it's great! My wrists can definitely tell the difference. I work at a company that still has wired keyboards and mice and only 3 weeks in my arms wrists hands were uncomfortable and aching. This is 100% worth the purchase!
5,I bought this keyboard to replace my Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Desktop 7000.  I've used Microsoft Natural keyboards since they were introduced in 1998 and LOVE the design.  The new keyboard works great.  I'm using the keyboard with a MacBook Pro running OS X.Pros:* Much quieter than the earlier Natural Keyboard* The entire set takes up much less space on my desk and is considerably lighter* Very comfortable to use* The separate numberpad adds a lot of flexibility - I've found I like this more than I expected* great design and material qualityCons:* The wrist wrest has a tendency to pickup dirt where I wrest my hands* No visual indicator showing if CAPS LOCK is on/off* I found the removable attachment to raise the front of the keyboard to be largely useless -- based on how I type it make the keyboard uncomfortable to use.
4,This is a great product. Learning how to use the key board takes a little time but after spending many hours writing papers or playing online games my wrists don't ache or cramp up. I've been using my keyboard for a year have not change the battery yet my wife has been using the same keyboard set at work for several years hence why I bought myself one for school. I would highly recommend buying a Belkin WaveRest Gel Mouse pad. The Mouse in this set moves so naturally without stressing the wrists but without the mouse pad the bones in your wrist rests on the desk.
4,I really like that though this is a split keyboard the numbers are close together at the top.  I like the movement and feel of the keys even though they are quite flat.  And I love being able to arrange it keyboard mouse numberpad which works so much better for me.  It's a little challenging on my accuracy but I am getting better fairly quickly.  The mouse is definitely as large as it looks. I am still getting used to that but I think it will be good.  Also even though I hate giving up a USB port to the dongle (which I had to look a the directions to find hidden in the mouse) I love that it wakes right up when I tap it much better than my old Bluetooth set.
5,I love this keyboard and mouse!!! I was having discomfort in my right shoulder and I realized it is mostly due to reaching to the right for the mouse. I rarely need to use the 10-key so I just leave it in my desk drawer and the shortened length of the keyboard reduced my reach and thus reduced discomfort in my shoulder. The split-style keyboard forces your hands and wrist into a more ideal ergonomic posture reducing your chances of CT or other musculoskeletal issues. The mouse is also awesome! It does a great job of cradling your hand and allowing your wrist to be in a more natural neutral posture compared to the traditional mouse that is smaller and your wrist is in a more flat position. I loved this keyboard and mouse set so much I also ordered it for my husband. :)
5,Excellent keyboard with an optimal ergonomic design that is very lightweight and feels like a feather with my fingers comfortably gliding through the keys with effortless strokes and painless minimal effort.  At first I was unsure as to how I would feel about the detached movable numeric keypad but after a few weeks of using it solo...I love it!  Makes going through my credit card statements and adding the charges for review and accounting purposes much easier!  I move the numeric keypad from the keyboard tray under the desk to the desk surface and use it like a calculator.  Works like a charm.  Excellent price too!  My only wish is that the resting pads for the wrists were a bit more cushioned for ultimate wrist comfort but they're still not bad...hence my 5-star review.
5,This is the best purchase I have mad for my office. What a difference it has made! The ergonomics are perfect and it's probably just mental but I sear my hands and wrist feel so much better after a month of typing/using this. I cannot recommend this keyboard and mouse combo enough!!Many users experienced the 'F' keys sticking. I have not experienced this and use the keys quite often. I use the media keys an insane amount and use the 'F' keys even more for shortcuts in Windows. The only annoying issue is that you have to toggle a switch at the top of the keyboard to turn the 'F' keys from 'function' or 'media'.My only real issue is with the mouse. I really cannot stand the high gloss on the mouse. I love it on the keyboard but the mouse just gets so dirty with the gloss. It's annoying and hardly alters the mechanics of the mouse but something to keep in mind.
2,Stopped connecting in just nine months. Tried everything and no luck.
1,UPDATE: I've had this less than 1 year and the 10-Key Pad is failing.  I do a lot of number work and I can't tell you how annoying it is to have this thing intermittently unresponsive.  Some times it works - sometimes not.  I've replaced the battery a couple of times and it is just not working correctly.  Too bad because I really liked it but at this price it is ridiculous to have it fail in 10 months.  Don't buy it.*********************************I was hesitant to buy a keyboard without the attached 10-Key but I've found that I'm very happy with and easily adapted to 2 separate devices plus the mouse.  The mouse works well and I like the convenience of the blue home key.  The keyboard looks a lot smaller than my last ergonomic one but I find it is comfortable and easy to use.  The 10-Key sits in about the position the built in one would on my desk but when I'm doing mostly accounting work it is nice to have it movable to the middle position.  I've only had it about 3 months so I've never had to replace any batteries - I'd have taken a star off if I had needed to this soon.The one complaint I have is the lack of an led light to identify when the Caps Lock and Number Lock keys are on.  The amount of energy that would lake is minimal compared to the extra convenience.  However the Caps and Number Lock both show on the lower right screen so it is easy to verify if you need to.All in all I am very happy with this set and glad I got it.  If they'd given us a couple of small LED lights it would be perfect so I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 - really it should be 4 1/2.
1,The batteries in the mouse need to be replaced frequently like once every few weeks even if you aren't using it. It seems like the mouse never automatically shuts off so it's always draining the batteries.
4,This keyboard is nice and quiet with the main keys having a smooth yet shallow action.The battery usage in product details (5 AAAs) is wrong.  The keyboard itself uses 2 AAAs the mouse uses 2 AAs and the numeric keypad uses a watch battery.The top row of keys (function keys escape etc) are not the same as the rest of the keys on the keyboard they have a less responsive (shallower?) action.  As others have mentioned these keys have a tendency to get stuck down.  The escape key is slightly wider and doesn't seem to stick as much but its overall size is still relatively very small.  If you use ESC frequently the small size and poor action may become frustrating.These complaints are minor still really enjoying the keyboard.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Best ergonomic keyboard ever! Keeps my wrists and arms in a very comfortable position. The battery life is great. I have one at home and in the office. As an administrative professional I am all about safety.
5,I have a roll top desk with a relatively small keyboard drawer and other keyboards don't fit well. This fits nicely and i like it beyond that. It is slightly different than my other ergo keyboards and the keys are activated with just a light touch so it takes a few minutes to adjust but once i get used to it I love typing with it. I am yet to change the battery. Eventually I will get them for the other computers I use. I don't use it for gaming.
5,I don’t have any stats to offer on battery life and durability yet as I’ve only had these for a few months. However having used ergo keyboards for decades as a writer and data monger I can tell you that this lovely little combo is really “the goods”. The split keyboard has nice action to it the mouse is not my dream date but works well enough for those who like a tall ergo mouse. I bought these to help me use my dumb flat screen hitched to a laptop for streaming. I’m fighting cancer and on my back a lot so a wireless ergo kb setup that could be used without a lot of effort was the goal and this sweet little suite was everything I could wish for.
5,I ordered this keyboard for work. Fell in love. Ordered it for home as well. I am a writer so I'm literally spending hours every day on the keyboard. I love having the detachable 10-key because I don't need it when I write and it allows me to have my mouse closer. It provides enough of a wrist support I don't have to remind myself to pick up my wrists. Much more comfortable! The mouse fits in my hand. It's a little large but I think that's the idea. It keeps it at a comfortable slightly-vertical angle as opposed to strictly vertical which hurts. I love all the little magnetic pieces and how the mouse has a slot for the usb. It was really easy for me to acclimate to this keyboard and fully get used to it in a day or so. I don't feel so rigid and forcing my arms directly in front of my body. Love this keyboard!
5,My friend at work uses this keyboard faithfully for the last 2 years.  I tried it out today and I like it better than the clunky ergo keyboard.  I don't see any quality issues and I use the mouse at work its very comfortable.I must have bought this a second time.  It must be a newer updated version of an older model keyboard I used.  This one has magnetic clasps on the bottom for the ergo wrist rest which is incredibly comfortable  the keyboard supports your wrists and aims your hands inward a bit on a downslope.  The mouse is large and rounded for comfortable hand support.  I just hooked this up today and I am only having like a five percent difficulty knowing where the keys are to type otherwise I am landing on them just like I should.
5,Absolutely love it.  This is my second time purchasing.  The first one lasted 5 years and I traveled for work all over the country with it.  Quality product.  The only annoying part is the number pad that I never used because of the annoying battery situation that other reviewers mentioned.  Mouse and keyboard are great and fine without the number pad.
3,Ive been using it for a couple of weeks now.  Normal typing is great and the keyboard has a really good feel overall.  It has a few week spots though.  The function keys are tiny.  As a programmer I find the insert delete arrow and page up/down keys to be really poorly placed.  After two weeks I still hit insert when I aim for delete page down instead of up-arrow.  All of those keys are clustered together and difficult to discern by touch alone.  I had the microsoft mobile ergo (bt curved) and find it much easier to type on despite being much smaller.  Unfortunately my quest for a keyboard with 1) No attached numpad taking up mouse space and 2) ergo/good wrist separation only left me with a few choices most of them twice as much as this keyboard.  Why is it that products can get so much right and the blow it on minor things. 5mm between the arrow / ins/ delete key area and the main keys would have made all the difference in being able to touch type.  For now it's still really awkward despite getting near 100 hours of use.
5,I'm giving this 5 stars for the keyboard alone. The mouse isn't great. If you care about ergonomics you need to get a more vertical mouse.pros:The keys have good 'feel' - they are responsive and have enough spring to them without feeling gummy.The position and angle of the split keyboard feels fairly natural and is simple to adjust to.Key sizes and placement are overall pretty goodIt looks pretty nicecons:the mouse isn't really ergonomic enough to be worth the strangeness and it somehow winds up being both too big and too small but I don't use it so I'm not pulling a star for this. Get a decent vertical mouse.notes:the 10-key is separate. This could be a pro or could be a con. I use the 10-key a fair bit and it doesn't bother me but I see how it could bother some.
5,If you're in the market for an ergonomic keyboard this is a great choice. Understand that this ergonomic keyboard is a little more pronounced than the average so it will take a little bit to get used to the keys. It took me a couple hours & I've been using ergonomic keyboards for the last 15 years. The battery cover on this & the mouse are magnetic & simply lift off to insert/replace batteries. Very convenient. Note that if you drop one & it doesn't seem to work push & check that the batteries are in place. I use one with my Mac at work & use with my Windows 10 desktop at home. For the money this is probably the best ergonomic keyboard on the market.
2,Besides it not even 'feeling' anywhere close to $100 worth of comfort worth-buying...The dealbreaker for me and maybe for you is if god forbids...you lose that damn USB receiver...which more than likely...you probably will. Because our friends at Microsoft haven't quite caught up with today's technology yet therefore left us with no Plan B on how to get them replaced. THe only current solution is to: 1) Toss it in the trash and just buy yourself a brand new set...or 2) Toss it in the trash and tell yourself..."nothing in life is free and that was one expensive try before buy product." Now I will say if you fall into the other unlucky bunch like me who just got another crap-built device and the USB dongle got stuck or broke on you well Microsoft will or should send you a replacement under their 3-year limited warranty. But fyi loss or missing items do not fall under that warranty either so sorry guys into the trash it goes..So Bottomline. Two Words for you that will forever change your life: Logitech. Unifying...Sorry but it's a real shame that Microsoft is even and still trying to bank off this poorly designed product of theirs and that they're aware of (just talk to customer service). Instead of stopping for a min to fix and develop a product worthy of selling and satisfying the customer. Not forcing them to either lose out on spent money or having to spend more. Not good business practice if you ask me. not goood business practice at all...tsk tsk.
5,Great ergonomic keyboard and mouse. Just enough of an angle shift in the keyboard and mouse for substantial stress relief in the wrists and forearm.
3,First of I love the feel of this keyboard with its ergonomics and short keystrokes. But leave it to Microsoft to screw up something good. 1. The receiver and keyboard are a matched set ie you can't pair with another receiver. 2. There are blistering and stickiness issues that arise with the mouse over time. Got so bad I bought a new one which is when I discovered the receiver issues I couldn't pair the new mouse with the old receiver. now I'm forced to to use a USB hub with my laptop as it doesn't have enough ports. 3. The keyboard palm pad is NOT removable/replaceable and stains badly with the oils from you hands. It also started coming unglued under my left hand and formed a small bubble.  Unfortunately its the only split/ergo with the laptop style keyboard (short keys/strokes)
5,This is my second set. I have one in the office and one at home. I have a lot of pain in my palm and I thought I would be fine at home with a basic keyboard but the pain returned quickly. Receiving this in the mail was the best self Christmas Present.
5,This is the keyboard I have been looking for.  I have for years used an ergonomic keyboard.  I always hated that the keypad which I never use forced my mouse to be further away and that my keyboard could not be center on my screens.  This keyboard solves all that.  You still get the keypad but can put it anywhere you want (or just never use it in my case).  The key action is really really nice.  Much less travel to press the keys than even the Microsoft Ergonomic Elite keyboards that I have been using for years.  I now have them at work and at home.  Found out they have been out there for some time and that others at work had them and I never knew.
5,I got this as I was having increase pain in my wrist.  I love the feel of the keyboard works well. I like the mouse the right click is a little hard to always get the right position to click properly.  I like the number key pad just wish my desk had more room to always have in upper r hand side.
5,This is the penultimate keyboard- leave it to Microsoft to create tech perfection. I use this key board at my office and have a Logitech keyboard in my home office and I feel like a straight up cave creature trying to type on that Logitech keyboard after using this.
5,Product showed up as promised and in pristine condition now it's time to do some work
5,Keyboard has a nice feel to it when you push the buttons - light but still clicky (even though it's not mechanical). The space bar is split in half - which makes it press normally unlike the ergo keyboards that have the bent space bar that requires more effort to push.Number pad is a separate piece from the rest of the keyboard - so if you have a smaller keyboard shelf/drawer this makes space for the mouse as you can move the number pad wherever you want.Mouse is ball shaped - kind of weird but I see how it will be easier on the wrist - you basically lay your hand on the desk so your wrist is straight and then fold your hand over the mouse without having to bend your wrist.Great product and highly recommend it for anyone who spends a lot of time at the computer!
5,I have two of these keyboards one for work and one for home. The ergonomic positioning enables you to stretch out your hands and relax. This Microsoft design is lightweight portable and very sleek. I put my feet up and type with the keyboard in my lap or sit on my couch and type away. Nice range and haven't had batter issues. Only critiques are that the elevation stand for the keyboard is connected by magnets which could be stronger--it comes off sometimes and I think the bluetooth USB is bigger than it needs to be.  The mouse is different from others due to the posture but very comfortable and easy to use. It is large in size which I like. I never use the separate number pad.
4,I love the hand position.I hate the detached number pad.I hate the way the arrow keys are completely surrounded by other keys. Its impossible to find the arrow keys by feel which is something I took for granted on my previous keyboards.The mouse is very comfortable in multiple hand positions even positions it wasn't designed for. You must be a righty...Is it worth the money. Yes if you do a ton of typing. Otherwise get the Sculpt Comfort set. Same price but less of a departure from traditional keyboard/mouse layout.
5,The separate numeric keypad is very handy because it is separate from the main keyboard.  That way the keyboard is smaller and more convenient.The ergonomics of the keyboard work very well and are comfortable.  I've experienced no fatigue or carpal tunnel issues even though I'm working the KB up to 5 hours per day.I find reaching certain keys in the very top row to often be challenging notably the "-" key.  I just miss it often and have to eyeball the key first before typing.  That does slow me down.After 4 months of use the "C" key failed.  Amazon replaced the entire set without hesitation.  The second KB set's numeric pad's number "5" wasn't working.  Again Amazon replaced the entire set.  I hope that doesn't happen again but it is dismaying.This is a great keyboard.  I'm satisfied with it and hope it lasts.
5,This set up is really nice and streamlined. I have limited desk top space so it's perfect. Much better than my old clunky ergonomic keyboard. Love the separate number pad. Very happy I spent the Xtra money for the quality
4,I really like the look of this keyboard it's a little odd not having the number pad attached but I'll get used to it. I do wish it had the option to lay flat instead of a downward slope towards the top.  Also recently I have found the accompanying mouse's main button to stick every once in a while.  I read others have also had that problem.  Other than that I really like it.  It's probably made for people with medium to large hands.  I  have small hands but I would still buy it again knowing all of this.
4,I am one of the folks who wasn't willing to leave my old microsoft keyboard. I had tried a different brand once and hated it but alas. My old keyboard keeled over so I took the plunge. Love this keyboard. It is lighter then my old one but the shape of the board is wonderful. The key action is a little springy which I enjoy. My only complaint is that the keypad isn't attached. For most people that's probably a plus. It makes the keyboard nice and small. however I used they 10 key all the time so it's a bit of a pain. But I still love this keyboard!
4,I have had this product for 16 months and have only had to change the mouse battery once.  I work from home and the mouse is on all day and I usually remember to turn if off at night.  I have two laptops and switching the dongle back and forth causes no issues.  However the wireless range is limited.  Plugging in the dongle on the far side of the laptop caused a spotty signal.  But now that I know to plug it in on the side of the laptop closest to the mouse I have no problems.
4,I work from home on the computer so the keyboard gets extensive use. I have had a problem with several incarnations of this keyboard with the letters wearing off. Even covering the keys with clear nail polish when first purchased did not help much. The keyboard is comfortable and the smaller size makes it easier to locate on my keyboard shelf. Currently I am shopping again because the mouse has become unresponsive despite new batteries and uninstalling/reinstalling.
3,I've had this for a few days now and I see why there are complaints with the function keys. Their design is stupid. They are half the length and half the height of the regular keys. Why??? Since they are thinner they aren't as easy to hit as a normal key. Since they are half the height of a normal key the edge is thin enough that it gets stuck at an angle when you press on it. If you press directly down then this won't happen but since your fingers are reaching to get to the function key then the key will be pressed at a slight angle and this makes their top edge get stuck under the surrounding plastic. Why didn't they make the function keys the same height as the rest of the keys on the keyboard?Anyway I like the keyboard enough to keep using it b/c not having a number pad saves me a lot of space on my desk and lets the mouse sit closer to the keyboard and that's worth it to me. But these stupid function keys shouldn't have shrunk to half the size/height as the regular keys. Bad move.
5,Loving the look of the keyboard on my desk quite unique.The keys work great feel smooth and quiet and battery life is very long. The detached keypad is a must for placing the mouse closer to the typing hands all while still being available to execute excel workstuffs. Wireless is a great touch for me to push the board out of the way while writing in my notebook in my small desk space. The mouse fits comfortably once you position your wrist accordingly and is very accurate.I expected the placement of the keys to be disturbing as I've never typed on a split ergo interface but I am very happy with the results. This comes with the caveat of a few keys being different from other keyboards making corrections the norm as I switch from desktop to laptop.
4,I bought this instead of the newer Bluetooth model because the design is so much better. I'm a software developer and a gamer so I spend way too much time using a keyboard. This really helped my forarms stop getting shooting pains down them. The only complaints I have is that the caps lock button has no indicator later. Drives me nuts. The mouse is also a little too tall for my tiny hands. Whenever other people come use my mouse they tell me that it's so hard going back to a normal mouse because mine feels more natural
4,I use this combination of keyboard and mouse daily at work; I'm a programer and I do a lot of typing and mousing.The keyboard is the best part of this combo. The split arrangement took a while to get used to but now it's very natural and comfortable. The key action is excellent.This mouse is also comfortable but the index finger ("left click") button has recently become flakey rendering it difficult to use. I feel the click but it doesn't necessarily register. This is after about a year of usage.
4,I like this keyboard and mouse quite a lot. The keyboard is not completely ergonomic but it has enough of that for my wrists not to hurt. I like the feel of the mouse. Having a smaller keyboard and the keypad separate is something of a trade-off - I am constantly looking around for the keypad but I can pick it up and use it like a calculator. The keyboard design is cool; however be aware that the keys can get small bits stuck under them and you can't pop the key caps off to clean under them and then put them back. Keep the keyboard clean (don't eat over it like I do) and it should be fine.
4,Love the keyboard hate the mouse.  The battery cover on the bottom of the mouse is magnetic.  Once I put the batteries in the cover won't stay on.  Very frustrating using the mouse and the bottom comes off.  The only way around it is to leave the bottom off.  So far no issues with the batteries coming out.  Poor poor design.The keyboard is awesome!  Very comfortable.  Keys have a nice touch and feel.  Works great!  No problems with interference with the other wireless peripherals that I use.  I wish Amazon would sell the keyboard only.
5,I was kind of "iffy" at first when I started using the keyboard. I purchased this for use at work and the last ergonomic keyboard I had was a little more substantial with regards to the key size. I selected this keyboard for the design mostly and I have really enjoyed using it. There was a transition period when I had to get use to the new spacing of the keys but it lasted all of 10 minutes and now I'm typing as fast as normal. I also like the 10 key and have no problem with it being separate...just makes it easier to move if you have a lot of numbers to type.I will say the ONLY drawback I have found was the material for the "wrist" rest is unusual and makes my palms sweat which is not so pleasant. But all in all great keyboard.
5,I originally thought it would be hard to type on this type of keyboard but after about 2 hours of using it I cannot see myself ever moving away from it! I absolutely love the way it feels on my wrists as well as how it types. The external number pad is somewhat annoying as it can be places where i have to pull it back over to where I can type on it but besides that it still works great!When i opened the box i was surprised at the large size of the mouse and wondered if i would just keep the mouse i was originally using; but after I used it for a while the size actually fit my hand perfect and feels great on my wrist and fingers!I highly recommend this product as an ergonomic stylish and affordable way to improve the comfortability of your workspace!
5,I've had this keyboard for a couple of weeks now and it was absolutely the best investment ever!  It took about a day to get used to but now it's hard when I have to switch back to a regular keyboard.  The pain in my wrists has completely vanished!! I'm so excited about this keyboard. The mouse isn't bad but it's not my favorite.  I like my thumb ball mouse that I have at home. The separate number pad is weird but awesome.  I do love it when I have to punch in numbers while I'm on the phone with clients and the fact that it has a key on it that pulls up the computers calculator and has a clear and backspace right on it is like having an actual calculator in your hand that types in the computer.  I love it.
4,I tried another ergo keyboard made by Goldtouch and the split keys and positioning capabilities were cool but the deep old style keys made it too loud for my co-workers. So I ordered the Microsoft Sculpt and it's a thumbs up from the team at Big Presence. I like the feel of the wrist rest and the wireless connection is essential to a clean looking desk.Only minor thing that bugs me in using this keyboard for a Mac is the slight difference in the position of the command key. Whenever I reach for familiar Apple commands I'm having to retrain myself.
5,I have used the Microsoft ergonomic keyboards for many years now; I kind of miss my big 4000 series keyboard but this one does the trick and wastes no space.  And as stupid as this sounds it has magnets!  It's really satisfying to get to the mouse batteries by pulling a little harder and then--pop--it's free with no damaged fingernails or risk or broken parts.The mouse is awesome.There are two drawbacks:1. The top row of keys "escape" and the function keys are a different kind of key.  It actually requires some effort to press them which is troublesome when using "vim".2. The home/end/delete set of keys (6 of them) are laid out differently from how I'm used to having them and they're kind of all up in in the "Enter" key's grill so I oops-press them a lot more than I'd like to.
3,I bought this to use with my standing desk ... no cords means no issues with different levels.  And as far as that purpose goes this set up was excellent.  The keyboard is comfortable though I am not sure about the mouse yet.  The materials scuff easily though and the "lid" over the battery compartment on the mouse just won't stay on.What is truly disappointing though is that the number pad isn't one at all.  It's a pop-up calculator.  Literally a calculator pops up on your screen.  There is no way to use it as a number pad--an alternative to the top row numbers on a keyboard.  So if you do a lot of numerical bits on your computer and are used to 10-key capabilities you're going to be woefully disappointed.  This is such a huge issue for me I may have to buy a whole different wireless keyboard.
4,This is one of the best keyboards I have used. Very comfortable for long term use. The mouse is a different story it is good but not as comfortable as the keyboard. I have large hands and this mouse is not as comfortable as the older mouse that I used to have (Microsoft Natural Wireless Laser Mouse 7000). Within two months of purchasing this set there seemed to be an issue with the dongle since both the keyboard and mouse became unresponsive. MS quickly sent me a replacement set and I have been very happy with.
5,Love it I've had it for a few weeks now and I can definitely feel the difference in my wrists. I work in front of a computer for at least 8 hours a day and after a couple of months I started to feel cramps in my wrists. I tried using wrist guards but even those weren't enough to alleviate the pain. I decided to make an investment on myself and bought this set and I'm happy I did.I'm not very technical when it comes to the specs or whatnot all I know is that I've grown very accustomed to this keyboard and mouse and I don't see myself going back anytime soon.The mouse also has some great extra buttons which you can customize once you download the program online and dare I say it's actually kind of fun to use.
4,I love this mouse and keyboard. Most importantly this keyboard has really helped my wrist pain. I was hesitant about the "sideways" mouse but that feels very natural now and works great. The back button on the mouse is also much appreciated.The only major flaw in the keyboard is that there are no dedicated media buttons (volume up volume down mute pause play etc). To use the media keys you flip a switch from white Fn keys to Blue media keys. So your F1 F2.. F11 keys become your media keys. Nice idea but I still have not gotten used to this. There was only once that I noticed some lag/delay when using the keyboard over the last few months.Great product overall. Highly recommended!
5,This desktop set is the best one I've used. I've been an ergonomic/split keyboard/curved keyboard user for years. The keyboard itself is fantastic. The keys mimic laptop keys in how the feel and respond and since I use laptops both at home and at work as my primary machines it is nice for the consistency. The feel is smooth and responsive and the tilt is adjusted by attaching a magnetic tier to the front that angles the keyboard backwards for a really relaxed wrist placement. I LOVE LOVE LOVE that the 10-key is a separate device as that allows me to do normal daily work with the mouse close and tight to the keyboard which reduces shoulder pain from having elbows out to reach the extra distance. The mouse itself is ok not amazing but overall a good mouse.  I have this set at home and at work.
5,This is working seamlessly so far on my iMac.  I VPN into a windows remote desktop for my work.  For personal use I only use 2 Mac based programs (iTunes & Safari) and use Office for Mac for my personal use.  I have used various split ergonomic keyboards (whatever no-name brand my employer purchased Logitech and Microsoft).  I was most recently using the Microsoft Ergo 4000 keyboard and the Logitech Mx mouse.  The Sculpt keyboard and mouse are so much more comfortable.  The keyboard is very quiet compared to the previous Ergo 4000.  There are buttons missing from the Sculpt mouse but I rarely use a mouse anyway so it has not been an issue for me.  I'm not sure if this product would work well for a hard core Mac user (I only have this iMac for the display) but for me it has been a seamless transition.
5,This is a great update to the previous Microsoft ergo keyboard. The design is modern and sleek the number pad being separate is nice for folks who want to maximize desktop space and the mouse is remarkably comfy despite its looks.My only complaint is that the key switches seem like they may die out faster than the previous iteration these switches are scissor switches like what you might find in a laptop or Apple keyboard. They are quite but that comes at the expense of durability and self-serviceability.I'm on my second of these keyboards because the first one that shipped to me was broken out of the box the left CTRL key was broken. Amazon was super fast in processing my replacement though so the experience was not too bad. I tried to fix the key myself but scissor keys like these are difficult to wrangle.
5,Love this combo!Keyboard:Although it will definitely take some time for me to adapt to the new hand positioning my wrists feel much more comfortable on this keyboard than on my Macbook laptop. My only dislike probably is the Escape button -- it doesn't use the same mechanic with the letter buttons so you need to press it a little bit harder.Mouse:To be fair the position of the scroll wheel is not really perfect to me as it usually lies at the center of my middle finger (my ring finger is on the right button my index finger is on the left button) so I cannot scroll a complete half-circle as usual. Besides of that I love how the mouse fits my palm naturally.
5,Like - very comfortable to use
5,Awesome keyboard very comfortable like that the number pad is separate even the mouse is comfortable with a gel mousepad. Works with Mac as well if you remap the modifier keys in System Preferences > Keyboard. Can also set up the back button on the mouse for things like Mission Control ("Mouse Button 4"). For some reason I can't get the blue button on the mouse to do anything on my mac although it should be "Mouse Button 5." Both of the extra mouse buttons work as expected in Windows 10. Downside is the annoying USB adapter which is big compared to the tiny logitech receivers and thus needs to be unplugged when you carry your laptop around. Still like them so much I have two of these sets. Great value.
5,Love this! Nice low-profile (meaning flat so wrists can lay flat).The mouse is cool too!I bought this for work. The desks are small (about 2.5 feet deep very non-ergonomic) and I needed more room for my arms so they were not hanging off desk. This keyboard and mouse did the trick; I can scoot it under the computer screen risers (was unable with my last high-profile ergonomic keyboard).My only complaint really not a big deal is the hand rest part of keyboard is a matte finish and looks sorry easily. I just use a baby wipe or cleaning wipe and it comes right off.Definitely recommended for those who love ergonomic keyboard!
4,Really comfortable keyboard and love the detached num pad.I have smallish hands and the mouse feels a little big. I have to use a wrist wrest with it to put it at a comfortable height.The fabric on the keyboard has slowly been coming off the plastic. It's been about 11 months and around an inch along the edge is no longer connected.The magnetic stand under the keyboard is really fun to play with. Works well but can annoy people in the room.Have replaced the keyboard batteries twice and the mouse batteries 3 times in 11 months.Works on a Mac though I haven't gotten the two extra mouse buttons working.
5,I received the keyboard and it appears to be as represented was in original packaging even with the tags that were pulled to activate the components.  I need to hook it up to my computer to see if it actually works.  I was very disappointed with the shipping.  It came from an Amazon warehouse and I expected better tracking.  The number given to me was not a valid number that could be traced and what appeared to be a normal UPS was not.  Then I got a notice it was shipped then a notice there was a delay it was frustrating.  I have a tote on my porch for mail but UPS and the U. S. Postal do not always use it.  I like to know when my orders are being delivered as my two canine postal inspectors have taken their toll on prior deliveries.
4,I really like this keyboard and mouse except for its intermittent (and now permanent) issues with syncing to the computer.  When the battery gets low or it hits end of life it starts missing key strikes and mouse clicks. Right now it takes forever to type anything because it skips so many letters in a completely random fashion. I changed the batteries as usual but this time no improvement.  I looked up my order date 2/23/2014 and the warranty length - 3 years and there it is.  Died right on schedule one month after warranty expired!
5,I really like this setup a lot.  However I do miss the USB cable.  The keyboard does a great job at battery life.  However the mouse does not.  I do forget to turn off the mouse when I am not using it.  However I am starting to think that rechargeable batteries are going to be the better choice.  I had to turn off the power saving option for the USB port for the wireless receiver otherwise both the keyboard and mouse would cut out on me while playing games on the computer.  After that I had not noticed any lag in the use of my mouse and keyboard during game play.
3,The keyboard and number pad has worked flawlessly for me so far.  I like the scissor keys.  They feel very light compared to other membrane ergonomic keyboards.  The mouse however constantly misses left clicks.  You can read about that all over the internet and Microsoft has yet to address the issue.  This is my 2nd set I purchased and both mouses have had the issue after a month or two of use.  Looking for a mouse replacement at this time.
3,TLDR;Great keyboard not satisfied with mouse.  Short battery life all around.  Next time I would buy just the keyboard.  With short range and battery life the mouse severely limits usability.KeyboardPros-Natural hand position; very comfortableLooks niceCompactCons-Fn toggle makes secondary functions much more annoying to useMousePros-Back button is well locatedThe mouse feels good in the hand even though it is nontraditional.Cons-Short battery life.  This is my first wireless mouse but the batteries only last about a week.Very low wireless range.  Mouse "jumps" with desktop under the desk.  I ended up having to set my tower on top of my desk for the mouse to consistently transmit.The windows button adds little value.  I have used the button once or twice but that's it.  The location isn't user friendly and I have found little need for a mouse button that takes me to the start screen.  You may be able to reprogram the button but not from the mouse and keyboard center.
3,I would rate this keyboard 5 stars on ergonomics and 1 star on everything else...  I love the ergonomics of this keyboard but everything else is disappointmentFirst ding it isn't bluetooth and requires a USB dongle.  That wouldn't be awful but the dongle sticks out of my laptop by nearly an inch.  I used to use a logitech keyboard/mouse that similarly had a dongle rather than using bluetooth.  It's USB dongle however only stuck out a 1/4 inch so I didn't worry about forgetting to remove it when dropping my laptop into a bag/case.  This one sooner or later is going to hit something and damage the USB ports.Second ding is related in that Microsoft's wireless keyboards are vulnerable to wireless keyloggers.  I'd planned on take this keyboard with me when traveling but now I can't use it away from home since it's trivial for anyone to eavesdrop on every keystroke.  http://www.networkworld.com/article/2868663/microsoft-subnet/hacker-builds-wireless-microsoft-keyboard-keylogger-disguised-as-usb-wall-charger.htmlHere's for hoping someday they release the exact some keyboard using bluetooth which would solve ALL these issues.
5,I love love love this keyboard set. There a nice give to the keys but they're not mushy or too stiff. The first set I bought is still going strong well after a year of constant daily use (I'm a writer by trade). I only bought a new set because I gave the first one to my husband after his keyboard died -- it was a good excuse to get a shiny new keyboard for myself!My only complaint is that there is no on/off switch for the 10-key pad nor is the battery easy to take in/out. The mouse has a switch and you can easily remove the batteries from the keyboard so you have to be careful of how you store they 10-key pad or the watch battery will die.
5,my go to wireless keyboard and mouse totally worth the money.Only complaint is that I had to purchase one every couple years as after a while of heavy use their connection to the bluetooth dongle start to act erratically and nothing could fix it other than buying a new set.
2,Update <3 years later: This keyboard had the shortest lifespan out of any Microsoft keyboard I've owned. I always use Microsoft keyboards whether on a PC or a Mac and always the ergonomic ones. In just under 3 years the a/s/d/f keys started misfiring sometimes triggering keys around them. I had to revert back to my previous Microsoft ergo keyboard that I still had (and still works after over 4 years). The fragility paired with the fact that on a Mac this keyboard is not ideal and the battery drains in just a week or two at best (even with good rechargeables like eneloops) I've demoted this keyboard to 2 stars.Original review:I always use Microsoft keyboards whether I'm on my PC or my Mac (I use both). I have for years. And this is the single best constructed setup I've ever seen Microsoft make. The keys are a pleasure to press and all the battery compartments are magnet-held instead of having those annoying clips you have to dig your nail into to open.The only thing keeping it from being 5 stars is the fact that this thing isn't really fully functional on a Mac. Granted they don't claim it does but this is the first time in all my years of buying a MS keyboard that simple things like the special buttons at the top (for pulling up the calculator or controlling volume etc.) didn't work out of the box.But other than that if you like the ergonomic style of keyboards this thing is fantastic.
3,Good:1. Best keyboard on the market.2. Very comfortable3. Light4. Nice key responce.Bad:1. Keyboard drains battery when not in use (no off switch).2. Number keypad drains battery when not in use (no off switch).3. Number keypad screw doesn't fit a paper clip and can not be unscrewed without a tinny screw driver.4. Number keypad drains fast when it's placed in your bag for transport (no off switch keys get pressed).5. Because of all above problems you must have a screw driver battery bag and time to take apart hardware in order to transport (no off switch).Recommendation to Manufacturer:1. Add an Off Switch for users that want to place your equipment in their bag.2. Replace Number Pad battery screw with a magnet (see your keyboard and mouse for design options)3. Consider normal mouse (it's a little big on the hand).
3,Two months after using this keyboard and mouse at the office I'm still not comfortable holding the mouse the way it's meant to be held (like an angled handshake) and I'm still a bit lost on the keyboard.  I'm used to a full-sized keyboard rather than having all of the arrow keys and home/page up/delete keys squished together in a proprietary configuration.  It makes me a bit slower and I question whether I'll ever get used to it or if I won't because the key configuration is just not optimal.  Based on the other reviews here I'm beginning to think it's the latter.  Having the numpad separate also isn't all it's cracked up to be.  Maybe it might be if I was an accountant but for intermittent numpad usage it's just too far from the rest of the keyboard.On the plus side the split keyboard design and mouse shape definitely help with wrist & forearm comfort.I use the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 at home and it's still my favorite.  If only they had a design in between the two.
5,I'm a long time user of the Microsoft natural line. I also have an ARC Bluetooth keyboard. This is a perfect blend of both. The "push" is soft takes little effort to press the keys the key stroke appears shorter and feels as though there is less effort to type. I liked the keyboard so well that I bought one for home and one for work.I like the key pad being separate as I have problems with my shoulder I stressed my rotator cuff in a fall and I find having the mouse closer to the  "center" of my work area reduces discomfort. I keep the number pad to the left at home and to the right above the keyboard at work.the mouse is much too high and causes the wrist to bend and contributed to my rti/jcarpel tunnel pain. Not recommended.
3,Love the ergonomic design has helped tremendously with my carpel tunnel syndrome in both wrists. This is the 4th set I have had to purchase as all previous keyboards just stop working after about one and a half to 2 years. I try new batteries that isn't the issue I delete software and then reinstall and that doesn't help. The mouse keeps working fine but the keyboard goes out. This time when I purchased I also purchased the 3 year warranty so I will be able to get this fixed or replaced when it happens again. I wouldn't continue to purchase but it helps my wrists so much that it's the only keyboard that fits for me. If you buy this pay extra and purchase warranty as well.
4,This took a while to get used to but I prefer it now.Edit.  Removed one star.  This is my second Sculpt keyboard.  The first lasted 1 1/2 years.  The current one lasted one year.  In both cases it was the mouse that gave out and I've not been able to find a replacement mouse.  I don't agree to give up 2 USB ports for mouse and keyboard so they both have to go.  I love the keyboard but not Microsoft's decision not to offer replacement mouse for it.
1,I like the Microsoft Sculpt keyboard and mouse when it works but it drops constantly. This product has a number of strange design decisions.The way the keys fan out for each hand takes some time to get used to but the split design of the keyboard and numeric pad is often useful.  The top row of keys are terrible bubble switches that snap downwards and click after a firm press.  The remainder of the keyboard has good scissors switches.The padded wrist rest is comfortable but it fades quickly.The terrible function keys have secondary multimedia functions that are activated through a sliding switch which is another odd design choice.  Microsoft should have chosen to implement dedicated multimedia keys and used scissor switches for every key.  For the price of this product the keyboard should be illuminated.The mouse is okay but it does not have enough buttons.  For instance it only has a back button but not a forward button.  The back button is difficult and awkward to click.I like the battery covers that are retained with magnets.  The mouse has a place to store the dongle.The biggest problem of this combo is that the long and ugly USB dongle is frequently dropped and I have to unplug and reinsert it to regain keyboard and mouse functionality. This has been going on ever since I got the product several years ago.  I had hoped that the problem would go away with new drivers but the problem persists.  It has occurred on every computer where I have tried to used it including Linux installations.If the USB dongle didn't drop constantly I would rate this product as four stars despite its strange design flaws.
2,I was excited to get this as it "felt" good in the store where I first noticed it.  However when using it I'm less enthusiastic.There is on ONE 'level' for the keyboard.  It lacks the flip-levers on the bottom that would allow me to change the angle slightly to raise up the rear of the keyboard - A feature I liked on my other Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard.I am also not happy with the detached numerical keypad.  It "moves" around as you might expect and is impossible to get a good feel with it being in different places each time I reach for it.  Thinking of gluing it to the keyboard with a piece of cardboard under both so they are always where I'd expect them to be.  It's also weird that I "fee" the Enter key is not in the right place.  I often miss it for some reason when touch-typing.I've still not gotten used to the "wide-stance" my hands need to take to fit the angles of the keys.  I'm always one-key-to-the-left for some reason.Actually after this I think I'll just return it.  Sure do like the soft-touch/quiet keys and the fabric softness of the palm rest.One last comment:  The HUGE mouse has a base-plate over where the batteries go but it WON'T stay on the bottom of the mouse.
4,Kills my old twisted wrist/arm/shoulder & stupid mount angle problems actually learning to use a keyboard finally due to LACK OF PAIN. Uses s***ty microscopic key feel / feedback switches major problems with double clicking keys etc. without knowing it due to micro/near non-existent feedback key action I personally really wish for something with a good "mechanical" key feel but this is NOT PAINFUL TO USE which gets it MAJOR (two star+ for this otherwise one star keyboard) allowances from me despite the crappy feedback/utter lack of feedback feel. I believe it would be very good for experienced keyboarders who already are comfortable with using "light as a butterfly dancing in a minefield" keystrokes. Mouse & 10key pad are good for me.
5,I got this keyboard and mouse combination for both work and home. Getting used to the keys took me 3 days of looking down to make sure i hit the right key. After the 3 days passed my frustration turned into amazement as i sat back and used the keyboard from across the room while having my PC sync with the chromecast desktop beta connected to the HDTV. The keyboard is SOLID. Meaning its built strong. For those saying that it wont work for games dont know what theyre saying. Been playing Battlefield 4 online and i couldnt be happier or higher ranked in the charts. Its not the keyboard its you. Lol jk. Buy this thing and get used to convienence and no USB cable taking up desk space. Best buy in years. Love the magnetic seals. Batteries last months.
4,Used my first set for six years. Was a beautiful workhorse. Changed jobs recently. Bought this set again (and then bought another set for my office at home).Three for three -- great quality of manufacturing materials etc.(I did have the wearing problems shown in the other reviews/photos -- but they didn't bother me. Showed that these were well used.)
5,very happy with this keyboard quite yet has a nice tactile response.  After many ergo keyboards/mice combinations from MS and others this one will be around for a while.  They finally got the battery life figured out on the wireless keyboard.  I use my setup 5-6days a week for work @ home and not changed the battery in keyboard(s) just the mouse.  The mouse and keyboard use magnetic covers for battery compartments... not a big deal but makes it easy.  No keyboard or letter wear on the keys after six months either still looks and responds as if its new.  Mouse is very comfortable as well.  Works well on all surfaces even where my old ones went crazy.  Using on windows 7 and server 20xx.  Cant say much about windows 8.x  Cant bring myself to use it.
5,I had the previous generation ergo wireless desktop set that MS put out and this is better in almost every way. The aesthetics are much better (my coworker calls it a spaceship) and I love the move to chiclet/island keys. The keyboard support and the battery doors are all magnetically attached. One thing that I didn't expect (but which grew on me) was the fact that it lacks feet to prop up the back end of it. It is designed to be used with the stand that supports the front which I have found to be more ergonomic. The only thing that I dislike about this is that they removed the forward browsing button on the mouse and replaced it with a windows button (and you can't configure it the other way). Overall a solid buy. Get it.
4,I like the keyboard but the ESC key is a tiny little button not a full-size key.  I use the escape key a lot this is an annoyance.  I also wish it had the standard layout for the insert home etc. keys.  If you're not picky about those two things this keyboard is terrific.  I'm trying to replace my Microsoft 4000 -- I've never liked the mushy feel and now that my space bar is getting gimpy it's time for a replacement.Personally I'm going to keep looking. Hoping to find a split-key contoured full-size keyboard with switched keys (not mushy membranes) a standard key layout and for bonus points a built-in touch pad.
5,Best ergonomic keyboard for petite people. The bum-pad is mobile and I love that I can place it to my comfort reach. I bought 3. One for work home & a back up.
3,I gave it only three stars because it's black making it difficult to see the letters and numbers on the keys and also because the keys are not backlit. As a result of the ill-conceived color and the failure to backlight the keys the desktop is difficult to work with at peak efficiency. Had I realized the inherent problems with these two issues I would have selected a different ergonomic desktop. I am not happy with the product because of these two major flaws. Not to mention the tiny Chinese characters on the little paperwork included with the product did not help me to understand that the "dongle" that connects the desktop to the computer was hidden in the mouse! Only due to the sharp eye of the Comcast tech was I able to proceed with including the desktop while he was here. Otherwise I surely would have believed that my product was missing the key product part of the "dongle." Therefore I feel that the "dongle" should have been taped in an obvious area of the desktop and labeled for what it is. Thank you.
4,The whole keyboard is pretty slim and the key presses are short and light. The curve does kind of a bell shape while makes Ctrl hotkeys not so comfortable to press. Get used to using the opposite hand for hitting control or remap the Caps Lock to Ctrl. I like it. If I could recess the keyboard into the desk about 2mm I'd flip.The mouse is OK. It sits a little high but should be good if you have a wrist rest. Your hand is canted and the ergonomic effect seems to work- my wrist is straighter it's not angled up and it's not wresting on the nerve.
5,This keyboard is simply amazing I have owned every Microsoft ergonomic keyboard with the exception of the latest one they just brought out and all I can say is typing on this is a treat. the mouse that comes with it is a bit odd but it works well has the tilt feature on the mouse wheel there is a hidden back button on it as well I found after playing with it for a while the separated keypad is a bit odd but I really like it.I usually use a mechanical keyboard for most of my typing but I find the keys very responsive and they have just the right amount of feedback while you are typing.
5,I am on the computer all day at work and even with an ergonomic desk and chair my wrist was starting to hurt.  I had a standard straight keyboard and no wrist rests.  This one is comfortable angling up to the keys and angles down a little where your fingers hit the buttons.  The mouse takes a little getting used to but your hand rests in a more comfortable position around it.  With my regular mouse I felt like i was having to keep my finger kept in a "hovering" position before clicking.  I also adjusted my chair arms so my arms align following the instructions in the box.  I have not used the separate numbered keypad yet.
5,I've had wrist pain from years of mousing so I stared looking for a solution.  First I tried rearranging my desk setup in a few different ways.  Then I tried a completely vertical mouse that my company ergo officer recommended but that just caused the pain to move to a different part of my wrist.  Then I found this Ergo mouse.  I've been pain free now for 6 months.  Also I didn't think it was a big deal before I bought it but having the keypad separate allows for much better mouse positioning.  When I need the keypad I move it where I want it and the rest of the time it sits out of the way.  Both the mouse and keyboard have worked seamlessly with a HP laptop running Windows 7.
3,Love the keyboard.  Great on the wrist and took me no time at all to become comfortable with it.  The keys have a great feel and a short reset which I like.  They do make a slight noise but I it is not a click sound.  The mouse is an ok size.  I used the Microsoft Natural Wireless Laser Mouse 6000 over 6 years and loved it.  This mouse does not quite fit the had as well but it is large enough and buttons are located in easy to access locations. My issue is with the mouse tracking.  It just doesn't perform well when you need pinpoint accuracy.  Once you get close to a small spot to click and you slow your movement down the mouse is very frustrating.  If you make a slight movement or slowly move the mouse there is a lag or no movement at all.  I have changed mouse pads with no avail.
5,Love this keyboard.  Takes about a couple of weeks to get use to it at first but after week one I immediately started noticing my wrist stop hurting.  This plus a modular keyboard platform easily becomes the typist best friend.  Even the mouse has helped as well.  I highly recommend getting two if you have a work office and a home office as going from this keyboard back to a standard keyboard my wrist started to hurt again after 2 hours of use with standard keyboards.  Battery life is great as well.  I have had this for about a year now and have yet replaced the battery in any of the devices.  I do turn the mouse off after I am done though.
2,I would not recommend this item.  It is overpriced and had some significant problems.Pros:  I give it two stars because I like the split keyboard design.  That is all that I can say good about this product.Cons:  The worst thing about this is the USB wireless dongle range is atrocious.  The keyboard response to strokes works almost normally but only if you have the keyboard and mouse within 12 inches or less of the dongle.  Any further away and the response on the screen from keyboard input lags is spotty and is agonizingly frustrating.  The second bad thing about this is the mouse.  I was never excited about the design. One it is very large and bulky.  I much prefer a track ball style if I am going to sacrifice compact size for function.  Two the little cover plate on the bottom that covers the battery compartment and also acts as a slide plate for the mouse keeps falling out.  I actually have to leave it off as it will not stay in. I wish I could return it but it's too late for that.  I am going to sell it on LetGo and say good riddance.  I will also likely stay with Logitech products for mice and keyboards as I have never been disappointed in their function.
4,I got a refurbished model.It was pretty much brand new just the batteries weren't working which for this is 2x aaa and 2x aa and 1 special watch style battery for the number pad.Just keep that in mind that you will need to track down enough batteries for replacements in the future.However that aside its comfortable (both the keyboard and mouse).I like the number pad has a backspace button.Also like the delete key is fairly large.And finally I like the magnetized accessories and battery doors.The one accessory lifts up the front of the keyboard which Im not quite used to. (usually I always have the back angled up)Nice keyboard mouse combo.
5,I was just sitting here typing on this fantastic keyboard and thought: "I must go write a glowing review of this amazing keyboard right now!" If that doesn't tell you everything you need to know let me elaborate.I have 5 natural 4000s for all my systems. This is everything that the 4000 offered in terms of comfort with the modern accuracy of the nicest chiclet style system I've encountered.It is a joy to use that somehow makes me feel like I'm in the future. Magnets use of negative space in ID love it all.The separate numeric keypad is nice too.And the mouse has grown on me for its ergonomics. The wheel sticks a little but other wise it all works well.
5,I absolutely love this keyboard. My hands and wrists never get tired or cramped even when I have to spend more than 8 hours at my desk. I have used other ergonomic keyboards and mice but none have even slightly compared to this one. I also use this with a Mac and don't have any complaints except that the "calculator" function on the keyboard does not open the calculator on the Mac. Otherwise all functions are transferable or you can reprogram the keyboard for the functions that you are missing (except for the calculator!). I have also used this on a windows computer and works great.
5,This keyboard is great.  I'm pretty tall at 6:5" so normal keyboards feel cramped.  I have a smaller work area at home so its nice that I can hide the keypad away to save space.
4,I bought this keyboard specifically because I needed to get rid of numpad. Overall it is very ergonomic. Doesn't trip nor any discoloration after few months of use. However the Fn keys are made for some different material and much harder to press. Luckily I only use the Esc key that too occasionally so it is not a big deal. No typing delays either.Also got the wireless mouse which is easy to use but I prefer a 5 button mouse. Doesn't stand out in terms of ergonomics
4,I've had this keyboard for a while now and I absolutely love it. However it eats through batteries like it has a never-ending hunger for power. Regular batteries die within two weeks and there was no difference with lithium. Rechargeable batteries can vary. There is an indicator light between the space bars that would flash red when the battery was low but not it just dies without warning which is fairly annoying.The only solution is to pull the batteries from the keyboard when it gets put up for the night.I haven't replaced the mouse batteries in forever.
1,A used mouse being sold as new? Seriously? Yes seriously. The mouse was obviously used and used hard judging from the deep scratches on the base and the fingernail marks on the upper surface.  It wasn't even cleaned before they stuck it in the box for heaven's sake. I had to clean debris out of the lens with a q-tip before I could even use it. It tracks very poorly the scroll wheel sticks the buttons sometimes require two or three clicks before they actually register. It basically is completely worthless.Second the keyboard was at least new but the quality is another story. This is basically little more than a cheap very poor chiclet style laptop keyboard that's been put in a fancy "ergonomic" shaped case. The keys feel mushy with virtually no feedback at all. Some of the keys take more effort to register than others. Caps lock doesn't work at all it seems.Ah and another issue that just popped up as I was tying this. It apparently loses connection with the transmitter plugged into the USB port on the computer. I just had to remove and reinsert it to be able to keep typingThis is just so disappointing all the way around.Edit - after just a few hours attempting to use this thing the right half of the split space bar stopped working. It stuck in the down position and wouldn't pop back up. After prying it back up it worked for a few keystrokes then wedged itself into the down position again.I gave up. It is now on its way to the local recycling center.
4,What I like the most about this Keyboard and Mouse is that it is perfect for working. If you need to do a lot of typing for long hours this is the perfect one this is because as it is ergonomic it also helps you type better. About the mouse they are pretty good will not feel tired after using them for a long period of time.
5,I love it the item is a dream to use takes up very little desk space and works very well. One of the best Ergonomic keyboards I have ever used and I have owned several. Installation is no more than plugging in the receiver and removing the protectors from the battery compartment. The only drawback and this is strictly personal is the lift they provide for the keyboard it installs on the back or bottom  and that is uncomfortable for me I would prefer it on the front of the board. However it works well sitting flat on the desk and that is the way I use it. The mouse is  or was odd shaped to me being almost round but it also works well Microsoft has given a lot of thought to this one. I also like the separated number pad cool little feature.
5,Perhaps not for everyone but perfect for me. Product has a quality look and feel. Love the separate 10 key. The mouse is very different almost a ball. Took some practice but I like it.Highlight of the package is the ergonomic keyboard. Key travel is perfect. Just a little click but no too loud. The palm rest is a soft but firm "rubber" surface. There is an optional stand that cants the keyboard forward. Great option if you are doing a long segment of typing.The slanted ergonomic keyboard is perfect for me. Just enough tilt to reduce wrist fatigue but no too much. I downloaded the software for the  keyboard/mouse. Work well.This package is not for those that do not touch-type or do not like the ergonomic style.
4,I really like using this keyboard. Very comfortable supportive and functional. Works on for my work on a mac and pc for design and development.Two issues one HUGE.1) Function key is not there. It is a little toggle in the top right corner that is not noticeable and does not really make sense if you need that key a lot!2) NO REPLACEMENT USB. If that s*** breaks you have to buy a whole new one. I really like the keyboard so going with it but something you should definitely know before purchasing.
4,Great product I like it a lot the only thing I find a little not to my taste is that the keys are a little on the smaller side and they are close to one another so if you are use to the bigger keys it will get u a wile to get use to it also I find my self a lot of times taping the shift key instead of the enter key but it's just a matter of getting use to it.Other than that it's a good product.
2,I purchased this Keyboard and Mouse combo hoping to replace an old version of Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard.  The new keyboard is lighter beautiful but somehow the feeling isn't quite right.  So I was only using the Mouse part.Everything was fine and I really liked the Mouse.  About two years into use it stopped working.  After replacing batteries connecting to different computers I finally figured out that the small USB receiver was probably short-circuited.  It generates a lot of heat when plugged in.I wanted to have it repaired.  So I brought it to a local Microsoft Store.  Technicians there said they won't be able to help.  I called Microsoft Support several times; each time the wait time was more than 50 minutes and they disconnected me right after transferring me to a different department.  For only once I got transferred and that was another 50+ minutes wait and the gentleman told me that he can't handle it since it's purchased via Amazon and I should talk to Amazon.com.However Amazon.com wouldn't be of use either.  For many orders there is a "Return or Replace" button but not for this one.  I don't know who I can talk to.  It is still within the 3-year warranty.
5,I was a bit worried about the chiclet style keys and the feel but this is the best keyboard I've ever used. It is very easy to type on the force required for the keys is low and hits a perfect key depth for me (long throw slows me down short is agitating. The ability to raise the front of the keyboard has improved my ergonomic situation and I am not having the hand and wrist pain I was having before I started using this keyboard.The mouse is good but not as incredible as the keyboard. It is a bit too rounded for my tast and the glossy finish makes it feel a bit cheap and sticky in my hand.
1,You cannot use another dongle as replacement. When you break it the whole is useless. The reason is security.These dongles have a unique ID just like car keys. Let's compare car keys with microsoft dongles.---Car keys are not easy to break the dongles are very easy to break especially the microsoft brand---you want car keys to be secure because it is a damn car you actually don't care if the keyboard is that secure or not and unifying receivers can also provide adequate security---you don't have to buy a new car if you don't have the key you have to buy a new set if you don't have the dongle.I am engineer and I can spot a poor design. If your whole design fails fatally due to a fault of a single component you change your design if you can. Sure microsoft could have changed their receivers and adopted unifying receivers like Logitech. Then the question is why haven't they yet? I think they just don't care about it about the customer about the environment.I try to think of use of the keyboard now and the only thing comes into my mind is to smash it for fun which is not even fun. I am very disappointed with microsoft. They pretend to care.
5,Replaced my 8-year-old wired MS Natural Ergonomic keyboard with the wireless MS Sculpt Ergonomic keyboard and could not be happier. It is just as comfortable to use but smaller and lighter weight. Unlike its predecessor (and most keyboards) the 10-key numeric keypad is separate from the keyboard itself which allows the QWERTY keyboard to be smaller taking up less space.  (I write for a living and rarely if ever have a need to use the 10-key on the keyboard.) I often use the Sculpt keyboard in my lap and it is easier to sit "centered" in the keyboard tray of my desk (beneath the monitor). Highly recommend.
5,Love this keyboard!  I am a programmer and utilized the old MS ergo 4000 series and while it was nice it had the old webbing style keyboard.Being a programmer keyboards are important and having a good feel is nice.  The key style is like contemporary laptop keys the scissor keys.  While they aren't full on mechanical they give a much better feel than the old membrane keys that most are used to.Another great feature is the mouse which is extremely comfortable.  Having a separate 10-key is also a great feature as it allows you to move it to another position if you want or you can put it to the right of the keyboard as normal.  Personally I use this on the left hand side and it works great.
5,The keyboard is fantastic and comfortable.  Truly relieved the hand/wrist fatigue I was suffering from.  The calculator not so much.  It doesn't seem to get a strong signal and only works sporadically.  If the calculator worked like it was supposed to this would have been a 5 star review.UPDATE:  When I received this keyboard the unattached calculator already had the battery in it.  I did open it and test it to make sure it had a charge but I did not check the way it was seated.  Out of frustration I pulled it and put it back in and it is working perfectly now.If you have the same issue make sure the battery is seated correctly in the calculator.
5,I LOVE this keyboard. I never had an opinion about a keyboard before but this keyboard is awesome.  I had the wired ergo Microsoft version before and I hated it.  I hated on the wired version how hard it was to press the keys.  This keyboard is everything that the wired one wasn't.  The keys are so easy to press.  It has a magnetic platform attachment.  The 10 key is separate. I love it so much that I use this keyboard for work instead of the one they provided for me for free.  My boyfriend got himself one for work too and I got one for my brother too since he works from home now.  I don't really have an opinion on the mouse.
4,Very comfortable works great. My only issue was I started having the keys not respond well used keys like delete and L.  Would recommend if you buy a warranty with it. Mouse is also buttery smooth.
5,I have always used ergonomic keyboards for as long as they've been available.  I recently updated my home office and wanted something newer and nicer looking.  Once I saw the Sculpt I knew I had to give it a try and I'm glad I did!  The keyboard mouse and number pad look and feel to be of very high quality.  The magnetic batter covers and stand are pretty sweet.  The feel of the keys and way my hand fits on the mouse is one of the best I've experienced.  GET THIS KEYBOARD!
4,I'm a software developer so I use lots of keyboard shortcuts. I've been a happy Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 user for several years. The sculpt has a nice feel. I love that it's a little smaller. I also like that it doesn't have folding feet that always fold in as I move it around my desk. It's got a sturdy build. and it uses magnets to snap battery covers etc in place nicely.My one complaint is that the enter key is shifted a little too far left and that the home/end/page up/ page down keys are stacked on the left side instead of in the normal place above the arrow keys
4,Desktop works well. The smaller size makes it more portable than my previous keyboard. I sometimes take it with me to work with my laptop when I am on the road. Since the keypad is separate the keyboard will fit into my normal brief case. The mouse took some getting used to but it is working well. I have the extra left button set to "paste" but it is not as easy to get to that as my older MS wireless mouse 5000. I like the magnetic catches on the underside of the mouse and for the raised part of the keyboard. It makes taking them on and off really easy.
3,I have been using ergonomic keyboards from Microsoft for about 10 years now in the workplace.  I purchased this one for use at home with hopes that it would replaced my Logitech Wave keyboard.  The feel of the keyboard is great but I have to be within 5 feet of the receiver with no obstructions to get it to function.  The receiver itself is also bulkier than modern Logitech ones so are more likely to get damaged in a laptop bag if left plugged in.  The performance and feel of the mouse is so inferior to my Logitech wireless mice that I simply discarded it.  The wireless number pad is truly the key redeeming feature since Logitech does not appear to provide a wireless Unifying variant of it yet.  I would say that this is great for a desk application but not for use from across the room as is more typical of modern computer-integrated entertainment centers.  I would suggest sticking with Logitech Unifying peripherals in those cases.
5,Takes a bit of getting used to initially but once you do there is no going back to a standard flat keyboard. I can type for hours on end with no breaks and my wrists and fingers don't feel like they have made a single stroke. The detached numberpad was a little awkward at first but then it made perfect sense and works really well with this setup. Having the ability to go back and forth with the number pad and the mouse is awesome! The mouse is also really good and fits comfortably with the wrist and hand. All parts of this combo set take some time to get used to but once you do they are extremely comfortable.
4,The quality of the keyboard and mouse overall is great. The shape definitely helps your wrists and the keys have a god tactile feedback without being noisy. However the biggest negative with this is that the wrist pad starts turning white after a few months of use (possible due to skin oils) and doesn't really go off easily. There is no easy way to clean it and no instructions either. I used one of the alcohol wipes and that did a reasonable job but for a keyboard at this price I would expect it to have a better quality pad.
5,Love it so far.  Easy unboxing; dongle is hidden inside of the mouse battery compartment.  All plastic compartment covers and the kickstand work  with cool magnetic contact points.  Overall over-joyed with this new purchase.  The materials used appear very professional and high quality but I could see as how the cover on the wrist pad would need to be protected particularly along the leading edge to prevent it from eventually wearing thin and breaking loose.  That said I plan on babying my new gear and will hope that this does not happen for quite some time.  All keys are working great! Time to resume my 90+ wpm!
3,The dongle is the only one. You cannot replace this. You will waste all that money if it breaks. I managed to not break it until recently. Time to try a you-tube fixer-work-around video! What a waste and I really liked it.Get of you high and might horse Microsoft. This is the last time I am ever buying MS product again.
2,LOTS OF KEY PRESSES GO UNREGISTERED. THE SEPARATE KEYBOARD IS A PAIN IN THE ASS.I'VE BEEN USING  MICROSOFT ERGONOMIC / SCULPTED KEYBOARDS SINCE THEY CAME OUT BUT I JUST CANT GET USED TO THIS ONE.THE UPPER KEYS ARE TO SMALL AND IMPOSSIBLE TO READ.THE SLIDER SWITCH TO ACTIVATE THE ALT /  SELECTION ON THE UPPER KEYS IS A HORRIBLE DESIGNTHE BACKWARDS LEANING DESIGN IS SENSELESS IF YOU GET ONE DO NOT USE THE OPTIONAL LIFT THAT GOES UNDER THE FRONT. IT SHOULD GO UNDER THE BACK!!!!THE DESIGN TO  MAKE EVERYTHING JUST A BIT SMALLER THEN THE PREVIOUS ONE PEICE VERSIONS IS NOT WELL THOUGHT OUT. THERE SHOULD BE A SPACE BETWEEN THE NUMBER ROW AND THE ALT KEYSTHE ALT KEYS SHOULD BE BIGGER  AS I SAID BEFORE. AND THEIR ALT FUNCTIONS SHOULD BE IN A DIFFERENT ROW ABOVE THEM. ESPECIALLY THE VOLUME CONTROLS.THERE SHOULD BE A VERTICAL COLUMN  / SPACE  BETWEEN THE BACKSPACE AND THE DELETE BUTTON CONTINUING DOWN TO THE RIGHT SHIFT KEY  AS THEY HAD BEFORE. OR THE LAST TWO COLUMNS ON THE RIGHT SHOULD BE ON THE SEPARATE KEYBOARDLASTLY UNLESS THE USB DONGLE IS WITHIN INCHES OF THE MOUSE IT BECOMES ERRATIC AND UNRESPONSIVE AFTER A FEW MINUTES USE. NO MOUSE ADJUSTMENTS WILL REMEDY THIS.
4,I love the keyboard mouse and overall design. It takes some getting used to but it's such an improvement over the standard keyboard that  I've always used/known. My complaint is that the USB is very fragile and easily damaged. It sticks out too far! It's now bent to where it's not usable...I will purchase another USB to go with my new wireless keyboard and mouse. The problem is easily solved but it shouldn't be happening in the first place.
4,As a Mac userSince all Apple products are not ergonomic shapes or design i tried to use the keyboard for my Apple environment (Macbook pro with two external monitors).If you are a mac user you might need to give up some function keys instead of ergonomic design. I installed a software to reset some keys on the keyboard. However it's little annoying to set it up manually.So if you use Apple products i think it would be better to stick to Apple keyboard mouse and trackpad.
4,I love this keyboard.  Aesthetically it is beautiful way better looking than my previous ergonomic keyboard. This keyboard is full size without feeling bulky.  I am also super impressed with the ergonomics -- It has almost eliminated my wrist pain. The only drawback is that once every couple of weeks it loses the wireless connection.  When this happens I need to pull out the USB connector and then put it back in then it will work fine.
5,This is a great product. I have used other Microsoft ergonomic keyboards and loved them. This one is even better. I never had any pains from writing on any keyboard and I write a lot for work and through school. The Microsoft ergonomic keyboards just feel better to me and are well made.  I used one of those keyboards to write all my work for my Master’s and Doctorate so these things are durable.The only thing I’m not sure about this one is the receiving unit. It works well but I can’t find any information on whether or not it can be replaced if it breaks. I hate to send everything back if just the little receiver breaks.
5,I purchased this combo around the same time I purchased my laptop stand.  I was having issues with my wrists forearms and neck and I was desperate for a change.  I use the keyboard mouse and number pad every day with my laptop raised about 3 inches off of my desk with my stand.  After using the combination for about a month I can truly tell a difference in my wrist and forearm fatigue.  My upper back and neck seem to feel much better too.The keyboard takes a little while to get used to.  It actually highlighted some bad typing form I have with the number keys so I'm adjusting to breaking that bad habit.  I'm so happy I made this purchase.  Everything seems to be built well and setup was instant.
3,- I hate the mouse but I can live with it- I hate the dongle (if it breaks or you lose it the whole apparatus is useless because the dongle can't be replaced- Love the KeyboardWas great for 5 years and 10 months. Can't really complain about that.
3,The keyboard looks fantastic.  It has Chiclet style keys so keep that in mind.  If you're not a fan then pass this by.  The keyboard I received had an inoperative - _ key.  I kept it for a few days using it as my work keyboard but the - _ key never came to life.  I'm not a lightning fast typist by any means but I outpaced this keyboard a number of times throughout the work day.  I overran the keystroke buffer often and had to pause in my work.The mouse is probably a love it or hate it affair.  Personally I mostly hated it.  The thing was too small to comfortably fit in my men's size large hand.  The sideways angle too no time to get accustomed to though so if you have small-ish hands maybe it will work for you.
4,I really like this keyboard but I could only give it 4 stars due to the lettering on the keys wearing off after a little over 1 years worth of use.  Admittedly this keyboard is used daily on my work computer.  This seems to be a long standing problem with newer Microsoft keyboards!  I've not experienced this problem with other brands of keyboards or the MS Natural keyboards from the 90's.I don't use the mouse that came with this keyboard I found a different one I like better.
5,I love this keyboard!  The keys have a nice touch to them and are fairly quiet.  I love the fact that they're low profile (somewhere between chicklet and the standard key style) and the stand that raises the height of the keyboard is magnetic (as are all the battery compartment doors) which is really nice nothing to break!  The only thing that this keyboard is lacking is that it's not back-lit but I can't fault it for that as it wasn't an option.  Overall the nicest keyboard I've ever used and the nicest looking as well and you never realize how handy it is to have the number pad separate until you experience it.
5,I purchased this keyboard as a replacement for a much larger ergonomic keyboard that had grown untidy inconvenient and gross. Ordered this one along with a thin cover (like a transparent shower cap) that is keeping it dust and crumb free. Carpal tunnel issues have remained in abeyance (yay!) and it functions well...and desk has more free space now.I’m very happy with this choice.
5,Love love love this set! I first used it at work and ended up ordering them for myself for at home. The mouse is designed to rest the outside of your right hand on the desk which takes some getting used to but it WILL save your wrist if you can make the change. I fly on the keyboard although I have always found ergo keyboards to be comfortable. The separate keypad is cool but I usually end up keeping it in a drawer and am too lazy to pull it out unless I am doing a ton of numbers. I use it on a Microsoft Pro 2 tablet and got a USB extender (http://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00BWF5U0M) so I didn't always take up my port and it has worked seamlessly.
2,This is my fourth ergonomic keyboard from Microsoft I bought the first two keyboards  many years ago before 2012; they were a good quality products; at some point one of these keyboards dies so I have to replace it with a new one that had the label "for business"; this was a good keyboard but the wrist pad quality was not the best looks like the material quality was reduced the old keyboard wrist pad was in better condition after the first year of use. Now I decided to give a try to this new model; for me is interesting that the numpad can be in another place so you can release some space and locate the keyboard aligned with the monitor easily. The keyboards design looks fine however the function keys are a mess you have to move a switch to use any function key like Volume up for me looks like a bad design; also the product quality is getting worse the wrist pad material has lower quality than the previous models looks like is going to damage soon and on my case two keys are not working on the main keyboard since the first day (PgDn and End). I’m really disappointed with the quality of the Microsoft products.
2,I have used the natural ergonomic keyboards for the past 10 years and have probably bought more than a dozen of them for various staff home and work computers in that time.  They worked well not sure why MS decided they needed to "fix" the design.The standard keyboard layout on this is familiar enough to my hands.  The location of the arrows delete key home end etc. are weird to me and would take getting used to.  However cutting off the number pad onto a separate device was a terrible move.  It adds to desk clutter (one more piece of hardware to move around) and it is HIGHLY inconvenient/unintuitive to have to take my hand off the keyboard and move it to another location in order to use the numpad.  The addition of a calculator button and backspace key on the numpad is interesting but not enough to make up with the sheer annoyance of having to go find the numpad every few minutes.I have no particular opinion on the mouse.  It works fine and feels comfortable enough.I don't particularly care for the magnetic latches on the keyboard support and battery compartments but realistically speaking it won't really bother me that much since you only access them occasionally.  They just don't feel like they close as firmly as the mechanical clasps.Time to go buy a logitech wireless desktop what a shame.
4,Having owned a few ergonomic keyboards before this by far is the best. EVER. Typoing angle is great mouse is just right and there's no cords to get in the way. I can't say that this fixed my RSI in my wrists and hands from the company provided keyboard and mouse but since buying this things are definitely getting better.-1 for requiring a propriatary dongle and not using bluetooth. This isn't being used in a top secret environment and it's not advertised as gaming grade equipment. Touting enhanced security or a .0001 millisecond latency improvement over bluetooth is not a selling point here. *Wireless* is.
5,I had the old Microsoft ergo keyboard that was wired. I wore the letters off the keys. This keyboard is really great I love the feel and it is very quiet to type on. I thought that I was going to struggle with the 10 key pad but it seems to work very good. The one thing I really miss is the 3 LED lights that are on the traditional keyboards for CAPS LOCK NUM LOCK and SCROLL LOCK. Just have to watch the screen better. The mouse looked clumsy and the buttons were a bit easy to miss. Once you get used to it the mouse is pretty cool to use.
3,I had the previous generation of the Microsoft wireless ergonomic keyboard and mouse for years and only got rid of it when certain keys stopped working on the keyboard. It was a gem and lasted at least 8 years getting heavy daily use. Looking for a replacement I bought this set. The keyboard is good I like the feel the response and the ergonomic layout. The mouse however it AWFUL. A plastic edge catches on the left button and makes it impossible to depress. I end up either forcing the button or adjusting my hand placement in order to click the left mouse button. The catching is inconsistent but regular and it makes using the mouse a nightmare. The mouse needs a serious redesign.
3,Ergonomics: very good; very comfortableFunctionality: not so good.  The range of the 'wireless' connection between the USB stick and keyboard is terrible. I have desktop that sits next to me. If I plug it in the back port of desktop computer keyboard has severe lag becomes useless. Works pretty well if I put it in the front USB ports.The fact that you cannot separate mouse and keyboard - or replace mouse with a new one because you cannot reprogram or buy a new USB connection like you can for Logitech is a significant limitation. The mouse is comfortable but also has quirks that I attribute to wireless connectivity that I ended up using a wired mouse.High failure rate. I think I went through 3 sets in 5 years.Wish it was better.
5,I prefer ergonomic over the regular keyboard. I have used Microsoft ergonomic 4000 keyboard for a little over 8 years and loved it but over time its keys started to get stuck so i decided to replace it. This keyboard comes nicely packed with instructions. Very easy to set it up. I also like that the space bar is broken into two so it will not get stuck like 4000 one did. Mouse is ergonomic too and feels very comfortable. I believe this one will last more than ten years it is so well made. The palm rest below the space bar is very soft and luxurious. I seriously think every keyboard should be ergonomic!
4,So far so good. Worked out of the box on a Linux machine. It's comfy and easy to use for me but there are some odd behaviors which I've read others have occasionally as well - most prominent is lowercase 'm' is fine and both shift keys are fine but rightshift+m doesn't type M and lesser such problems (hotkey issues no other issues impacting day-to-day typing) have sprung up. No connection battery or construction issues at all. Great feel and comfort.Overall pleased for the price. Will continue to work to sort minor issues would be 5 stars w/o those.
5,After looking for a good ergonomic keyboard for probably a decade this seems to be the one!  Having tried several models that were definitely not ergonomic (like Microsoft's previous "ergonomic" keyboard that required way too much pressure) this one has an amazingly natural angle and soft touch keys.  I also love the separate number pad which allows for placement of the mouse much closer to the keyboard and helping position the arm more naturally.  It'll take me a little while to type as fast as I used to given the new curvature but I know that's just a matter of time.  Kudos to whoever designed this keyboard!
4,Comfortable. Love not having the numerical keyboard attached because I don't have to reach over more for my mouse. When I type on a regular keyboard my hands are always tilted. This keyboard was designed for tilted hands making it more comfortable when resting your palms to type. Keyboard layout took some getting use to but I adjusted quickly.Not a fan of the function keys. They don't click as smoothly as the rest of the keys. Smaller too.
1,There's a lag time between what I type and what the keyboard output. I have tried 4 other wireless keyboards I have and none of them seem to "freeze" when I type the way this one does. In some other instances  my "quick fix" is to slow down to and type one key at a time for a few minutes but this is hair pulling for someone that's used to type at 160 WPM. In some other instances even when I'm slowing down it types the same key up to three times back to back. I could see that I could have a typo here and there when I'm typing at my natural speed ... but like how do I justify typing one key ONCE and what displays on screen is 3 instances of the same key???Same when I'm using the mouse there are times where I'm trying to point at a shape for example specifically to the center of said shape  so when I try to drag the mouse to that section in particular the mouse starts shaking and goes further up/down from where I'm attempting to point by 25pxs approximately.The issues started about 2 weeks ago months after purchasing this convo... I've power cycled the devices (by taking batteries off as there's no "On/Off" button) and replaced batteries but none of this has worked.  is a damm shame.My personal experience: total waste of money and time not worth the investment at all. Don't make the mistake I made.
3,The keyboard is great once you get used to it... much easier on the fingers hands wrists than standard keyboard. But beware of the "ergonomic" mouse -- it's not for everyone!  I used the mouse for about 6 months.  It wasn't very comfortable -- made me extend my thumb out further than I was used to with a flatter mouse which was annoying and even a bit painful but I figured I just needed to get used to this "better" configuration.  Then one day I woke up with a terribly sore wrist and forearm - - couldn't even lift a coffee cup.  The pain persisted and was finally diagnosed as tendonitis (specifically DeQuervain's Syndrome)... more than two years later it still hurts although improving slowly with physical therapy and most recently with Platelet-rich Plasma therapy.  Lesson learned -- using a mouse should not hurt.  If it does switch to one that doesn't!
2,I love this keyboard and mouse but I learned that hard way that if the dongle is slightly damaged it will stop working. There is no replacement for it. If the dongle is damaged or lost you will need to purchase a whole new set. Totally wasteful and non-sustainable.
4,WILL NOT WORK WITH MAC OS X 10.11.1 EL CAPTAIN. I love this ergonomic keyboard combo. It helped relieve a lot carpel tunnel syndrome showing up again. Had some issues with Mac OS X Yosemite but was able to solve them by installing a third party software called "BetterTouchTool". However when I upgraded to Mac OS X El Capitain this combo stopped working completely. I hope Microsoft will create a fix for that soon otherwise I will have to sell this combo and buy one that will work with Mac OS X El Captain.
5,I've been eyeing the sculpt keyboard for a long time after using microsoft's previous natural keyboard.  It's so much smaller and yet still excellent to type on.  It's much more like a modern laptop keyboard but the ergonomic twist is what really is key.  I wasn't at all interested in the sculpt mouse because of it's odd shape.  I generally use a magic mouse but after using sculpt I am very impressed - it's super comfortable.  It has replaced my magic mouse at my desk relegating that mouse to travel.  My only complaint is the dumb non-reprogrammable windows button on the sculpt mouse.  Why microsoft why?
3,Mostly OK but I have the following pros and cons:Pros:nice form factor angle of arms to the keyboard is very comfortableI like the separate number keypadthe touch of the keys is pretty soft but still tactile enoughI like the attached wrist restCons:the number 6 is on the left side of the split which is the wrong side for me who learned to type on a manual typewriter in the 60's. Consequently every need for a typed 6 results in a 7 because I learned to use my right hand to reach the 6. This is a HUGE issue for me and has been with almost every ergo keyboard I've ever used.the number pad keys are not as good as the keyboard keys resulting is missed strikes when inputting data. not good.the mouse is as others have noted very bad. I have abandoned its use and returned to my Evoluent vertical mouse.
4,Exactly what I had hoped for.  Only reason I wouldn't give it 5 starts is because I have larger than average hands and the wrist support hits my palms at the edge.  This is my first ergo / wave style keyboard; you learn right away what "bad" typing habits you have picked up over the years the "B" key in particular must be hit with left Index (assuming you use the home keys as intended) just a little different than what I was used to.
3,Overall it's pretty nice.  The standalone number pad is quite handy.  The keyboard itself feels nice (similar key travel to a Macbook).  The function keys are not the best but perfectly usable.  The switch to change between function keys and the media/whatever keys will be a turnoff to some but I never flip the switch so it's not a problem for me.The keyboard does have one big flaw.  I have to type 3-character strings in all caps on a routine basis.  If I hold down the shift key while typing the characters I can be virtually guaranteed that at least one will come out in lowercase.  If I type very slowly it works fine.As for the mouse I couldn't in good conscience recommend it even to someone I didn't like.  I tried to get used to it but it's just awful and resulted in a lot of wrist pain.
4,This is my favorite keyboard/mouse combination and I have two of them.After three years and three months of home use the mouse is now useless. The primary mouse button works only intermittently. There is no way to disassemble the mouse and service the switch under the primary mouse button.I don't expect my gear to last forever but 3.25 years is a bit short for this amount of money.
5,It works it's ergonomic and the whole setup requires only one USB port.  The raised front end initially surpised me at how entirely comfortable it is.  But you want to use that with the keyboard at the correct level (e.g. and under-drawer keyboard tray).  If you're trying to use it on a higher table or desktop you'd need to remove the riser from the front which is easy with the magnetic attachment.  As others have noted the battery setup for the numeric keypad is the only part that's not fun.  The other con is no on/off on the keyboard and numeric keyboard (but the mouse does have one).
5,Battery is a bit short but seriously months and months and it dies - what am I complaining about!!!!I love this keyboard and mouse.I live in two cities and travel back and forth one in each place can't live without them.
5,Took some time to get used to the split keyboard but after a week or two I got used to it and noticed it really helps my type speed and hand comfort. The mouse is very large and also took some time to get used to but I like it and it feels good in your hand and my wrist pain went away. I don't even need the old mouse pad with wrist rest anymore. Overall very happy with my purchase the keyboard has a;ll the sweet windows features built in too I find myself using them a lot. Surface 3 user w/ Microsoft dock.
5,This product is amazing and super east to use. I’m my wrists feel great and I honestly think it managed to improve my typing. Buying my mom one soon!
4,This is a step up from the Natural Ergonomic Desktop 7000 it replaced.  I like the detached 10-key and sleek design.  I have big hands and would have liked to have larger keys as with my Lenovo laptop and the old Natural Ergonomic Desktop 7000.  I have had it for several months and still double key more than normal.  If it were not for this I would give it a 5 star.  However if you have normal or smaller hands and like Ergonomic Keyboards look no more.  If you have big hands it is worth trying.
5,I'm a developer and I've been using the Microsoft ergonomic keyboard for as long as I can remember.  This latest keyboard surpasses all others in the family.  It has such a qualify feel to it and the key response is perfect.  The mouse looked a bit odd at first but it works well.  I get why the number pad was made as a separate piece and I think it's a genius move.  Those who use the number pad frequently will love being able to put it wherever you want.I usually don't do product reviews but really impressed with this product.
4,I don't know why it's so hard to find a good ergonomic wireless keyboard and mouse that doesn't cost a fortune but this will do for now. I prefer more of an angle both on the horizontal and vertical planes but that seems hard to find. I do love the separate number keypad and it's come in handy on numerous occasions. My main complaint is that the material on the cushioned part is kinda hard to clean. I'm sure there is a secret to it but it collects gunk pretty easily. I wish it was just a regular vinyl or something.
5,I switched to this from the Microsoft Ergonomic 4000 keyboard so that I had something smaller I could sit in my lap.  It takes a bit getting used to: not having a keypad and having a lot of the buttons moved around. Also the function buttons (F1-F12) are too small for my taste and they are a bit weird to push down... I wish they were normal sized buttons like the rest of the keyboard.  Other than that I love it.Definitely my only real complaint is the function buttons.  Since I'm a software developer I use those all the time.
1,I was ready to love this keyboard even though it consumes a USB port. I quite liked the key travel and mouse responsiveness. Transitioning from a bluetooth keyboard I particularly liked how quickly the devices responded after sleep.Then I discovered the bad.First the device started failing intermittently. About once a day the dongle fails. There's no error message but the devices simply stop responding (while moving the mouse or typing). Ejecting and re-inserting the transceiver corrects the failure.Second I found the device will keep my computer awake. It seems that when my monitor (which has an integrated USB hub) goes to sleep it powers down the transceiver. This change causes the transceiver to wake the PC. I'm using Windows 8.1 on Windows-certified hardware.Third I tried on three different occasions to contact Microsoft about this issue. The web site refers to the wrong support number which doesn't have an option for hardware so I end up going to Windows support. I then have to describe to each technician my problem who attempts to transfer me to hardware support. The first technician disconnected me. The second one transferred me to a line which had a message in Spanish and then left me hanging without hold music for over 20 minutes. In my third attempt I decided to try e-mail. I went to the web site and started the support flow for sending a support request via e-mail but that process requires entering a product key but the product key cannot be found anywhere and their instructions about where to find the product key are wrong. The only other option is to call.Triple Fail! I give up and am sending it back as defective.
3,The keyboard is much smaller (est 2/3 size) than a standard ergonomic keyboard - MS Ergonomic 5000. The number pad is separate (not an issue if you don't use it much) and the keyboard's keys feel more like a laptops key presses than a regular keyboards. There is a unique FN slide switch which allows you to switch from special functions to standard F1-F12 keys. There is a "calculator" button on both the keyboard and the keypad - which starts the Windows calculator. The mouse is my only issue. The "ergonomics" makes it feel like holding a baseball - not a mouse. Not sure if this is a good thing but I'm still forcing myself to get used to the angle and hold. I do like the "WINDOWS 8" START button on the mouse and find it helpful at times.  My plans are to use this keyboard for a "entertainment PC" that sometimes does double duty as an email machine.
5,I now own two of these one for work and one for home. Admittedly I'm not a touch typist but I do type with both hands and more than two fingers. The comfort on both the mouse and keyboard is unparalleled in my 30 years of using computers.The ease of setup with a windows based machine is truly plug in the usb dongle pause for 10 seconds and go to work. Batteries are pre-installed just pullout the plastic tabs and you're ready for work. Pulling off the magnetic panel on the bottom of the mouse did take a second or two to figure out the first time I setup.
1,Notice - All extra key strikes in the headline and this review are part of the reason for giving this a 1 star review.I have had issues with the separate number pad working since the day I purchased. I have had severe issues with random keys doing multiple key strikes for no apparent reason as you can witness from the mutiple t's in the headline. I finally had to go into the keyboard settings of the computer aand  slow down and multiple key strikes to keep it from constanntly sending my text to 10+ extra key strikes.I will be replacing this item with a Logitech ergonomic combo as soon as I can afford to.
5,Things to know - I has chicklet keys and the top row acts more like buttons than keys. There's a backspace button on the separate 10-key which is awesome and the mouse is both chunky and heavy which I like. There's a little magnetic ramp that will tilt the keyboard forward but not back in the classic style. The Delete key is vertical which can take some getting used to. Overall it feels like quality and I  have no complaints after  using it for a number of weeks.
5,I use a Sculpt wireless keyboard and mouse for work and recently bought one for home use. I find the slightly angled keys more comfortable for typing. The keypad can be moved out of the way when not needed and the rounded mouse is also comfortable. I used to have some wrist pain from using a keyboard so much but since getting this keyboard / mouse / keypad the pain has gone away. I can't say for sure this combination has "cured" me but I can type and drive a mouse without wrist pain.
4,I love the size because I'm a female. The size is perfect for my smaller hands so I don't have to stretch them to reach certain keys. I'm a software engineer so having a good keyboard is very important to me. The only thing is the dongle sticks out and I hit it accidentally one day when I put my laptop down so it stopped working.
4,It has taken some getting used to but I really like the keyboard. The mouse has been pretty glitchy until I found a tip to attach the tiny USB receiver to a 6 inch USB dongle to get it away from the computer's chassis. That fixed the mouse issues but now I have another cord floating around my desk making this a "half wireless" mouse at best.
1,Don't even think about purchasing this keyboard. And here is why I'm suggesting this:1. At first I was so happy that I have this fancy user input device with all those extraterrestrial shapes of the keyboard and mouse. It will take you weeks of practice to get used to it. Especially if you are coming from the regular [rectangle] keyboard type. Missing letters punctuation marks accidentally closed windows and incorrectly send email messages - you name it...2. NumPad is separated from the main keyboard. Seriously? Every time I needed to use numbers I first had to find the numpad. You will always place it on the side so that it doesn't bother you all the time but one you needed it call Hercule Poirot and good luck with that.  It died with me only using within 2 years.  Apparently cheap stuff from China.3. This alcantara material around the keyboard start peeling off within about 1 year of using the device. Really? For $100 this quality?4. Battery life is a completely separate conversation. On average I was getting 2 months of use. Keep in  mind you will have to use 2 different types of batteries - one inside the mouse (AA) another one inside keyboard (AAA). So unless you want to carry batteries with you all the time skip the purchase of this keyboard and mouse.5. I was using the keyboard and mouse only 2 years before it completely died. Make your conclusions before buying this...
4,I bought 2 of these over a year ago - for work and home - to have a consistent keyboarding experience. The keyboard and mouse haven't been a problem but the numeric keypad has been an issue. At work it will inconsistently miss various keystrokes. At home certain keys will not register fairly regularly when depressed. Neither of the numeric keypads has been abused at all so it is a design or build flaw inherent in them.
5,As far as keyboards go this one is pretty rock solid.Compared to other keyboards it has the following prosLightweight ergenomics for reducing stress on your hands and wrists a lift plate that goes underneath which can raise it or keep your hands at a much more comfortable level.Cons:(Personal note) it's wireless-I prefer wired the mouse that comes with it is really nice but I don't find it as ergonomic as other mice that I have used found.Overall this thing is great! Bought it and have been using it for a month now with now issues. And my hands and wrists feel 100x better.
5,At first I was concerned that the new ergo design would break up my efficiency in my workflow.  I was wrong!  Not only do my arms shoulders and wrists no longer hurt after 12 hour days but I can type faster and more accurately than before.  As the IT admin I have bought two of these for others in my workplace!  No need to really say anything more than that the separate number pad is awesome and the big honking mouse is the perfect design idea MS has had this decade.Love it!
2,I really wanted to like this keyboard and thought it would be a good upgrade from the natural ergonomic keyboard model 4000 I have used for years. I gave it a go for a few weeks but I had to retire it today. Yes it was comfortable but 2 issues were the deal breakers a few of the larger keys backspace delete enter etc. when typing fast on the fly the keys would not register the stroke I would have to stop and give it a solid push in the center of the key it would not register a touch on the corner for example. The real deal breaker was the separate number pad which I use a lot it was basically garbage and never worked right. Perhaps it came with a low battery I don't know? But it would not keep up with me keying in numbers not just not keep up but of a 6 digit number for example it would only key in 4 of them a massive frustration for me. I am back to typing out this review on my trusty old model 4000 welcome back old friend I missed you! To the Sculpt don't let the door hit ya on the way out.
5,I've had a couple of these keyboards.  They work great.  Really help the shoulder pain I had from using a regular mouse and key board.  Unfortunately I lost the keyboard and mouse when traveling so had to buy again.  Well worth the $.
2,I have owned four ergonomic MS Keyboards since the late 90’s and 3 matching mice and this is the first set I found to be LOW QUALITY. On the positive side the 5 keyboard rows work great and I prefer them to other MS and non MS keyboards (except the HP Elite 2!). All of the older keyboards are still functional as well as the mice but some of the mice materials became gooey. The detached numeric pad is also a great. You use it only when you need it. The problem with the main keyboard and the detached number pad is the top row there the reduced F keys and other functions rest. They are VERY POOR QUALITY. The Esc key has almost no travel distance its right side is sunk and my keyboard makes a crunchy noise that is not very reassuring. The mouse was working great up until 3 months ago. At one time is was a good mouse. But it is not good anymore: the left button sometimes sticks and you need to press hard and sideways the first time you start using it.In my opinion for this set the MS Hardware department REDUCED THE QUALITY of the product perhaps for maximizing revenue. For my next ergonomic desktop I will be looking elsewhere.
2,I liked the keyboard okay at first but over time it caused worse hand pain than my previous one (a Lenovo). The keyboard spread for the pinky on the right side is way too wide. The mouse is also pretty terrible. It has a high profile so I'm constantly bumping into it and knocking it off the desk. It's also too large for me to comfortably use it as indicated (with the side of the hand resting on the desk). The separate 9-key is quite inconvenient and its flat design make it not ergonomic. The 9-key battery also died within two weeks of purchase despite little use. I replaced it with a new battery and so far so good after 3 weeks. The mouse has an on/off switch but the 9-key and keyboard don't requiring me to take out the batteries if I want to turn them off or travel with them. Seems like an obvious oversight in the design. The USB dongle is quite a bit larger than others I've used for external keyboards so it gets jostled and bumped more often. Overall not a great product.This keyboard is a stop-gap; it's a small improvement on what I had before but not great. I'm still looking for a good ergonomic keyboard and mouse setup.
5,A great ergonomic keyboard and mouse. Split spacebar gets rid of the issues that plague other Microsoft ergo keyboards. Island style keys are easy to press and give great feedback. the mouse is comfortable and precise.One thing to note: Unlike Logitech USB dongles this system does not allow you to purchase extra/replacement USB dongles. The USB stick is tied directly to the keyboard and mouse that it comes with. Not only does it mean you should actively keep it safe it also means that if there is a chance you might want the mouse at some point down the road you should probably just get it now since the difference is $5 (or at least is at the moment).
3,Update: This keyboard now intermittently has issues with recording keys. It looks like others have had the same issues after owning for a year +. I really liked it other than it not functioning for long. I have updated it down to 3 stars from 5.I bought this for the keyboard and was skeptical of the mouse especially after reading some of the reviews. After owning and using this set up for a few weeks the mouse has really grown on me. I even bought another mouse for work. It was awkward at first and I almost gave up on it glad I didn't. On the con side there is no unifying dongle for these products I have a lot of Logitech products so this is a bummer. Also I haven't found an obvious place to buy a replacement dongle. Other than that I would definitely recommend this set up.
3,This keyboard is beautiful. Its like the classy full sedan from an Italian car maker. I love the feel of the chiclet keyboard and the soft but firm wrist pad.My coworkers love the separate keypad much to my dismay. It keeps being stolen then the calculator will open and start doing math frustrating but funny.Now for the bad part. I cannot figure out why but for some reason typing 'CD' rapidly in succession results in 'CD'. It doesn't happen every time though. Without lifting from the shift key and pressing C and D in succession results in 'CdCdCDCDCDCDCdCDCdCd'I tried calling Microsoft and figuring out what was going on but I was told that technical support had a $35 fee!!!!! They want me to pay $35 to figure out why their hardware is broken.  Cd doesn't seem like an issue but I use an acronym very frequently at work that includes CD.
5,At first i was convinced that i was going to give this thing back but i persevered through a week or two getting used to it.  My final analysis is that this thing is awesome.  The keys move really quickly and easily.  It's very comfortable.  I think my typing speed is increasing.  The mouse was super strange at first but again after working with it for a while it's really feeling natural.  In fact the whole thing feels really natural.  I'm really liking this now.
1,I wanted to love this keyboard I really did. I've owned every other Microsoft ergonomic keyboard and so far and loved them dearly. Despite the improvements to the model line in the Sculpt there are several major drawbacks to this keyboard and I feel very burned by this purchase.First of all the numpad was DOA or at least I never got it to work. Not sure exactly what the problem was here but whatever I can live without the numpad. However the keyboard itself died after about 6 months of use it just died mid-sentence and there was no reviving it. MAJOR disappointment here.I'm willing to accept that perhaps I just had a lemon but even in perfect working condition the Sculpt has a number of flaws:- There's no function (Fn) key so if you want to use Alt+F4 or your media keys you need to flip a tiny switch in the upper right-hand corner- The function keys are tiny and spongy and get stuck sometimes. God help you should you get F1 stuck and start opening up thousands of help windows.- Placement of PgUp/PgDown/Home/End is very awkward and silly. Given enough time I could probably retrain my muscle memory to hit these correctly but sadly the keyboard up and died before that could happen.Otherwise the key action is nice it's a bit similar to Apple's keyboards these days. The pleather wrist rest is also good but these positive attributes cannot outweigh my disappointment with the overall product. I'm instead going to replace the Sculpt with a Kinesis Freestyle I'm hoping based on the reviews that it can shine where the Sculpt has failed me.
5,This keyboard and mouse set is great!  Soft touch for the keys and the mouse is very comfortable to use.
5,I've been a big fan of MS ergonomic keyboards since the original one.  In the last few years though they've gotten significantly overcomplicated with multimedia control buttons volume controls quick launch etc.  This keyboard is a far more minimalistic design so it's a normal sized keyboard without being ludicrously large.  the detached numerical keypad is a great idea.  I use the keypad every day so it's nice to be able to place it where it works best for me without moving the keyboard.The ergo baseball mouse is a little offputting at first but is actually quite comfortable to use.One criticism is the faux suede wrist rest is already showing discoloration from skin contact after a single days use.
1,Very disappointed because I really liked this keyboard.  I deal with bilateral carpal tunnel and my prior job got me this set-up and it helped tremendously (and staying away from too much typing and taking breaks as well).Fortunately the mouse and the stand-alone numbers pad still work but the MAIN feature the keyboard is not working.  I have attempted to change batteries twice fresh out of the box batteries - installed correctly. It clearly is not an issue with the USB port/connection - since the mouse and the numbers pad still function seamlessly.Disappointed because I absolutely need to have an ergonomic keyboard but the mouse and the numbers pad still work. It would be awesome if they could send me another keyboard but I suppose I just have to shop around and pay money again for a more quality device.All in all 4.5 stars out the gate... diminished to 1 star (only because the other two devices are still functioning for now).
5,I have been typing for well over 3/4 of my life and I've got to say...it has taken a toll.  I suffer from corporal tunnel or the beginnings of arthritis or both and my hands get to hurtin' regularly.  I previously had a large bulky ergo keyboard and was looking for something more streamlined to go with my decor when I found this sexy piece.  It is sleek it is beautiful and I love it! I especially love that the key pad is not attached.  I couldn't be happier with this purchase!
5,I have a split keyboard at work so I'm used to the layout already.  This is not identical but close enough that the transition is easy.  I really like the feel of the palm piece at the bottom of the keyboard.  There is just a bit of padding - maybe a quarter of an inch.  Just the perfect blend of softness and firmness.  Also the number keypad is easy to use.  I am an accountant so I use the number keypad quite a bit. No complaints on the mouse either.  It is important to not hold it over the top but to allow your hand to naturally rest on the mouse pad to the right of the mouse.
3,I like the ergonomics of the keyboard and mouse.  This set up would work well for people who mostly do typing.  However the ten key pad is not ergonomic at all and sits a lot lower than the keyboard.  If your job consists of high number crunching this unit will not be the best fit.I work with numbers all day long so I was hoping that this keyboard was a good replacement for my Microsoft ergonomic 7000 (which has been discontinued).  After working with the key pad for a couple of days my wrist started hurting so I had to switch to an old Logitech keyboard.  At this point Logitech is the best option out there if your looking for a comfortable ergonomic keyboard.
5,I bought this product since I was having difficulty with carpal tunnel. I find this keyboard to be exactly what I needed. It's an easy transition from a normal keyboard and I find the clicks of the keys to be just the right amount of pressure needed. I have still been trying to get used to the separate number pad but don't mind it at all. The mouse is really comfortable. This was a splurge purchase but definitely worth it. Highly recommend!
5,I have an injured hand/arm so the mouse is great for me. It does take a little getting used to since it's off-set to the right but I love it! The windows button at the thumb is super convenient but also super weird to put it right there kinda wish they had put it a tad forward so you don't accidentally hit the silly thing. Great keyboard very natural to use.
3,I have been using this for less than 1 day.  So I am still learning the keyboard and it is taking some time.  I had an ergonomic keyboard before and didn't have to look at the keyboard as much.  Hopefully with a few more days practice I will become more comfortable.I like the fact it is smaller than the other keyboard I had been using for 7 years.  There are less wires clogging my space and the mouse seems to work very well.I would give would give it a  higher rating once I become more familiar with it.  I can start to see some improvement in my usage already.Joe Canino
3,In less than one year the tab key fell off the F key only works intermittently it uses up batteries about once per month and the enter key stopped working. I could not find any way on Amazon to ask for a replacement within warranty. It types OK. Would prefer the keypad to be attached rather than detached.  I will not buy this product again. Also make me leery o Microsoft products in general.Additional Comment: Baed on my experience with Microsoft Returns Department I'm adding one star.  Microsoft came through and replaced the keyboard. It cost me the return shipping. As I could not find a better alternative I'm giving the keyboard another chance. Hope it last longer next time.
4,Not made for gaming but great for office work. Just remember that you need proper typing technique or you will struggle using the split keyboard. The keyboard is very quiet and the most is very smooth. It had helped my carpal tunnel. Highly recommend for all ergonomic desk setups.
3,This is a well executed thought on Microsoft's part.  It is attractive light and portable.It a joy to look at but in all honestly it doesn't offer an experience compatible with something like the Microsoft Ergonomic 4000 - 6000 series.The curve of the keyboard and action on the keys is quite different than the other ergonomic models.If you use your computer for work you probably should give this a try - as I did - because if it suits your keyboarding style it would be great.That said I gave mine away within a week because a keyboard is a tool for me and I expect it to help me be more productive.  This one looks good and that can be important but if anything it hurt my productivity.
5,I love this keyboard!  I have the same one at work and loved it so much I had to buy one for my home computer.  Totally worth the price.The only negative is with the delivery of the package.  It was left in the most visible place of my porch from the street.  We have a column by the door that hides packages very well and the delivery person was just too lazy to put it there rather than on the porch bench.
5,This is an excellent ergonomic keyboard. I had to return it because the zero key popped out but the vendor replaced it immediately.
4,The keyboard is really awesome as long as you know how to type properly.  I had several wrist surgeries and this helped my wrists hurt much less at work.  The mouse on the other hand is not well-designed.  The idea of keeping your wrist a certain way is great.  However the wheel is set too far back so you can't really keep your hand in the position the mouse is designed for.  I recommend getting the keyboard only and looking into another mouse.
5,I have the Microsoft sculpt ergonomic keyboard and Mouse now for about a month and I enjoy it. I was getting a tingling sensation in my hand with my previous mouse and this one seems to be better because it doesn’t happen anymore. The keyboard is great it didn’t take long to get use to it. The number pad being a separate piece is a little odd but not a reason to keep from purchasing the product.
4,Difficult to use at first due to the shape and layout but after a month or so I became proficient and move around it faster.  No problems with arm/wrist fatigue and I work on the computer all day.  I do not like the disconnected 10 key though.  I use my right hand for the mouse and the ten key.  One of them is always in the way of the other. Very cumbersome.  Would be 5 star if it weren't for the 10 key.
4,I really love the way this keyboard feels when you type and the design.  My first one broke after a year so we’ll see how the 2nd one does - I liked the overall experience so much I ordered another one even though breaking after 1 year isn’t a sign of good quality.
3,The design is great. Very futuristic-looking and ergonomic. However I just could not get used to typing on this keyboard. I gave it a good shot typing everyday as I usually do (IT Professional). I didn't find that this keyboard either improved or made my Carpal Tunnel pains worse. However at times I felt that I was having more pain than usual. The mouse is not ergonomic. The buttons are positioned in ways that the hand does not naturally pose. I ended up going with a Logitech M570 mouse for this purpose and I am happy.I just don't think this keyboard works as advertised and the price is a little too much for the build quality especially of the mouse. I mean glossy finish for a mouse? C'mon!
4,Keyboard gets 5 stars. I adapted to it instantly and it is very comfortable. If you are on the fence about the mouse I would opt for the keyboard only. The mouse is alright but the ergonomic pros are outweighed by its awkward cons. The main issue is that even though my hands are averaged size at most the slope causes the side of my hand to drag on my desk. Either stick with a standard non-ergonomic mouse or go all the way and get one where that is the priority. The keyboard is amazing though.
2,I bought the keyboard because I liked the style and footprint. Unfortunately it has some serious drawbacks. The keyboard as well as the separate number pad frequently miss the first keystroke which causes me to miss a lot of passwords and I constantly have to correct my typing. Missing numbers on the keypad pretty much makes it unusable for work with spreadsheets. Occasionally a key “gets” stuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck (like this). So using the keyboard is a pain. Microsoft does not seem to care. The internet is full with people having the same issue and no suggestion I have tried works. So: ergonomics: 5 stars usability 1star.I use Win10 (also from Microsoft). Maybe this keyboard works better on a different computer.
3,I really like this keyboard now. Initially there was a learning curve to manage my hands to click the right keys without looking but now I have gotten used to it. I like the idea that the number pads is like a calculator but it does get irritating some times. feels like a third leg. Mouse is really weird. It was first really daunting but now I see why the shape is such.Edit: The receiver recently just stopped working. It was perfectly fine looks fine. I am not sure why this happened. Now I find out that Microsoft does not have receiver replacement. While I gave the product five star I have to down grade it simply because it stopped performing as expected for reasons unknown and there is no replacement besides buying this set again.
4,Classic MS ergonomics. Keys are quiet and feel great. Much improved over the older split keyboard styles (I've had most of the MS ones over the years).BUT DO NOT LOOSE THE DONGLE. The dongle is specifically tied to each set. Lose the dongle you just lost the keyboard set.I contacted MS and they gave me a good will replacement product (bought a set for work a few years ago then bought this one for home thinking I could use 1 dongle between two sets).
5,I did some research before purchasing an ergonomic keyboard for work and I came across an article that highly recommended this one and didn't provide alternatives because none of them held a light to this product.Excellent keyboard and mouse take the strain off my wrists; I am a email customer service agent so I spend 8+ hours a day 5 days a week typing.There was a slight learning curve mostly because I used my left hand to hit the Y and H keys which are on the right side of the split.Great product excellent value and it is easy to set up and use.
5,Best keyboard ever!  I admit I was hesitant to purchase it with the number pad being separate but that ended up being one of the best features!  It does NOT slide around on your desk and you can pick it up press a button to launch the calculator program and use it like you were holding an old calculator in your hand.  The keys on the keyboard feel great. The overall size takes up a LOT less room than my previous ergonomic keyboard did (not to mention this one is wireless). The back to the mouse and the stand to the keyboard attach via magnet which is REALLY nice! I highly recommend this one.
3,I purchased this keyboard because I needed to replace my wired Microsoft ergonomic keyboard and believed this one most closely matched the layout of my old keyboard. I am happy with the layout but I am disappointed by how the touch and feel of the keys does not at all compare with my old keyboard. I am having a more much harder adjustment than I expected. I am also disappointed with the arrow keys - their layout is different enough to confuse my fingers and I find that they do not seem to consistently react to my pressing them.The mouse is exceptionally bulbous which has also required an adjustment but I like the feel in my hand. The higher profile has caused to swing my hand over from the keyboard and completely knock the mouse off my desk.
3,Compared to the old-school Natural keyboard (beige then black) this one is not as good on a couple fronts. First of all the height of the wrist support is either too high (with the magnet attachment) or too low. The curvature is not as pronounced but is good enough. And feel of the keys is a bit weird takes some getting used to. The worst part is the ESC button. Lower than other keys very hard to reach and press at the same time.I do like the fact that the number pad is separate. Allows for fast numeric entry when doing spreadsheets etc. Also allows the mouse/trackpad to be closer to center removing some shoulder strain.Overall I really miss my old Natural Keyboard. Wish they would make one with BlueTooth.
5,I love the separate number pad. That the keys line up more naturally for your fingers. and make it easier to type. The only unusual key for me is the location of the number 6 but I usually use the number key pad for my number keying. You have the option of using the riser that comes with if or you can use the keyboard flat. It comes with a rest for your wrist.
1,Avoid this keyboard. Not only is it a battery hog.  Far far worse is the fact (and I'm having difficulty typing this now) that when the batteries are low -- or even thinking about getting low (which is about every two weeks!) -- the Windows Settings page just arbitrarily jumps up on top of whatever you are typing -- and you end up typing the second half of the word you were typing in its search bar rather than say in the Word doc you are trying desperately to finish.  At first it does this once a minute but frequency increases until it is every three seconds.  Over and over and over again.  (Just happened again: second time since I started writing this.)  It is SO frustrating!  Also even when the batteries are new you cannot make a "greater than" symbol because when you hit that key -- guess what? -- it takes you to the Windows Settings page too.  I've searched all over the internet for a fix for this but no luck.Basically this keyboard works fine about 80% of the time but I need a keyboard that works fine all the time -- and doesn't send so many batteries to the landfill!  The Settings window popped up four times while I was trying to type this -- and this thing has gone through so many batteries that I have none left in the house.  So now how do I get my work done?  Thanks Microsoft!
1,I bought this in late November of last year.  Originally thrilled with my purchase as it is very comfortable to use and seemed to alleviate some fatigue in arms/shoulders/hands from being at the keyboard all of the time.  However the quality has been awful.  The mouse started not responding intermittently maybe 6 months later and shortly after the same thing wit the keyboard.  Taking the USB plugin in an out ocassionally would help but eventually both just stopped working.  Multiple battery changes as well just to be sure i didn't have bad ones.Very disappointed as I liked using this product but basically was a waste of money as i know I have to pick another product and spend more.One update to this review finally spoke to microsoft and even though they say their hardware is covered by a 3 year warranty and I am well under a year they told me a new USB with the driver to run the keyboard and mouse was not covered.  I asked if i could get a whole replacement and that is not covered.  I asked them then what exactly is covered.  He told me to read the warranty on the website which does not really contain specifics.Incredibly disappointed in a company as big as microsoft and will never purchase one of their products again after this experience.
5,This is my 2nd set and Microsoft did a great job on the design and the functionality. Buttons are easy to activate and smooth batteries (supplied) last long time (my first set is 6 months old and still using the original set with daily usage). in less than 30 seconds my computer recognized the micro-USB and I was on my way to using it. The mouse is bit different at first but after few days it's normal. After months of using the ergonomic keyboard and mouse my wrist feels a lot better.
4,This was my first wireless keyboard and mouse purchase.  I love the keyboard and mouse.  The only reason I did not rate this 5 stars was that the location of the receiver was not indicated in the product description nor in the documentation that accompanied the package. I had actually submitted a Return request on the package before I accidentally discovered the USB receiver hidden in the mouse.  Thankfully it was very easy to cancel the Return request.
4,For the most part I really like this keyboard and find it very comfortable to type on. The function keys aren't great though and can stick sometimes. Easy enough to unstick but it's still annoying. I wouldn't think the mouse would be nice to use from looking at it but it's surprisingly comfortable. Not for lefties though. It's a good replacement for a Natural Ergonomic keyboard if yours gives out.
2,I've used MS ergo keyboards for years and I was so excited at the thought of a wireless quiet ergo keyboard with a separate number pad. I never use the number pad so I wanted to get the mouse closer to my right hand. In theory this works perfectly.In practice it's been a letdown.The keyboard is not Bluetooth - it has a proprietary wireless USB dongle that you have to plug in.The keyboard uses flat MacBook style keys - low very short travel no click action very quiet. It's like typing on buttons - and in fact the Escape and Function keys are actually buttons not keys. You have to look down at the keyboard and actually press the Escape key really hard.The function keys are dual-purpose - they're also media volume search keys - but if you want to switch functions you have to look down at the keyboard and move a manual switch at the top right. There's no function modifier key. You've either got volume keys OR function keys but not both. Kinda painful for us IT workers who need to regularly hit keys like F5 and we also want shortcuts for volume up/down.The first key broke just two weeks into using it so back it goes.
5,I've been looking around for a while now for a wireless split keyboard and I found this one. A bit pricey but well worth it. It's extremely comfortable and if you've ever used a split keyboard before it should feel natural to you. If you haven't as long as you have proper typing technique it shouldn't feel foreign. The keys are laptop style keys so the keystrokes are very light and crisp. The mouse took me a few days to get used to... It's comfortable but odd. However after having it for a month or so now I love it and my other wireless mice I use for my laptops feel strange. All in all love it. Don't hesitate on giving this a shot!
5,Prior to purchasing this I was using my Chromebook keyboard and felt the burn creeping into my hands and wrists.  Since using the Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic keyboard my posture overall is better and I've felt no pain.  The keys respond quickly and the bonus number keypad is efficient for all the number entry I do.  The mouse is comfortable and quick-responding as well.  The sooner you buy this the happier your body will be with you.
5,Great ergonomic keyboard and mouse! Great price.
5,Since most of us are working from home I got this for my wife.  She is happy.  This is what she had at her work.  Also no problems with connectivity.
4,I'm a big fan of mechanical keyboards and wished they made a keyboard that had mechanical switches as well as an ergonomic split keyboard form. This particular keyboard is pretty nice though. It has laptop style switches so imaging typing on a laptop and that's the kind of light pressure you'd be using. I like the ergonomics of the mouse as well as the futuristic look of the keyboard but the one thing I didn't like was that the function keys aren't the same switches as the regular keys; They seem more like buttons than keys.
5,I was in the market for an ergonomic friendly keyboard after my old ergonomic one that I bought in the early 2000's gave up. I was looking for one that was Bluetooth capable and included the NUM KEYS. After trying some here and there I think I finally found a winner with this one. My wrists feel fantastic typing on it and its very comfortable. Though in opinion this should be better priced at $99 its still worth it. Its very accurate when typing and the mouse feels natural. Best of all I didn't have to install some silly software. My Windows 7 box detected it and installed the drivers automatically.If you have some ergonomic typing needs this combo is a winner in my book.....
5,The only thing that would make this perfect is if the keys were backlit and bluetooth capabilities were added. These things weren’t included probably to prolong the battery life but i think they’d be well worth it
4,I like the three piece set.  It works very  well on my desk where I have an elevated desktop for my laptop.  It helps to be able to arrange the keyboard and the keypad in specific placement and the mouse can be mobile on a mouse pad which I utilize.  The number pad us paired with a battery insert.
5,I've been using it for programming for almost two years now and I really like it.  Keys are easy to press and has reduced my hand pain from typing substantially.  I also type 5-10 wpm faster now.  I will say it took me a good month to get used to it though.  I stick the separated number-pad below the keyboard instead of to the side which also makes my mouse easier to use.
5,I love this keyboard and mouse. I have had one at work for 8 years and just got another one for home.
4,I started to develop pain in my wrists do to being on the computer all day. I purchased this combo in order to have a more ergonomic keyboard. I noticed that the pain started to decrease and I can probably say that it was due to getting something more ergonomic. I also like that the keyboard comes with a 10 key however i would like it better if the 10 key was attached to it versus being its own independent piece. Aside from that I'm very satisfied with the product.
4,Very good product
4,I like the mouse and the keyboard  but not the separate numeric pad.  Weird that it was included as a separate device.  For some reason the mouse would lose connection once or twice a day.  Had to remove the USB dongle and replace - connected fine but a PITA..
4,Mouse is so comfortable and has a nice movement/feel to the cursor nice feel to the keyboard keys as well.  Good response not too loud when typing like a mad man...not sure I LOVE the number pad not being part of the keyboard but getting used to it now.Great product little pricey for what it is.
4,Love this keyboard. Having the number keys on their own pad is cool. The one thing I would change or suggest to Microsoft is to put a touchpad area on the keyboard just south of the space bars. Then it would get five stars from me. Other than that it's my favorite keyboard ever. I had my employer buy one for me to use at work and I bought my own to use at home.
2,Pros:  Lightweight and portable... nice to be able to have a portable ergonomic keyboard and mouse.  I find them both comfortable and easy to use but I am also used to using the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic keyboard so this is not much of a change for me.  Key are more like the keys on a laptop (i.e. much easier to press) compared to the keys on the Natural.Cons:  This is a big one (at least for me) and the reason I gave only 2 stars... the keyboard and number pad do not have power switches!  Mouse does.  Why not the other two components?  I bought this system to be portable so I could put the components in my bag when I travel but when you do this inevitably a key gets pressed from being in your bag and proceeds to drain the battery dead.  I avoid this by removing the batteries in the keyboard and number pad when I travel but this is a pain and should have been avoided with some semi-intelligent design from Microsoft.  Hopefully they will fix this in the future at which point this will be an excellent product.
5,I never cared for ergonomic keyboards but this one stole my heart. When our IT department brought me this „thing“ I thought they were joking... nope not joking. It’s the best keyboard I ever had! I even bought one for my home office. The mouse that comes with it is great as well! Now the weird part is the number pad it is separate but I like it because it’s out of my way when I don’t need it.
4,The keyboard is pretty nice as well as the mouse.  The main pain point for me is the "function switch".  I use the function keys a lot but also use the play / pause key a lot and this keyboard puts those two uses at odds with one another.  types fairly well and the mouse is nice.  Been waiting for a keyboard like this with the 9-key separated but there are a few things I wish they would have left a little more similar to the layout of the Natural keyboard.
5,Great keyboard if you can keep the usb connector safe
5,Absolutely love this keyboard and mouse. It does take a little getting used to using the keyboard but man is it ever comfortable to use. Your hands are able to type more and the right style of finger use because of it's unique design. Instead of raising the keyboard in the back it's done with the front. I especially love the detached 10 key. The whole set up uses a very small USB port device (like you'd use for a wireless modem connection) and installs quickly. I can now type without all of the discomfort I had with standard keyboards.
4,This is my favorite mouse and keyboard. Stopped my pain from carpel tunnel syndrome quickly. But there is one huge flaw. If you lose the USB dongle you have to buy a completely new set. They appear to be hard coded to the keyboard/mouse. Other keyboard/mouses out in the market use universal dongles that are easily replaced for a couple of bucks.
1,This product superficially looks so nice and is designed so well except two major issues.  I'm sure all of this has been said but PLEASE take heed: The USB dongle sucks. It sticks out and it overheats meaning it is really easy to break with minimal use. It's "uniquely paired" to the set which means if it breaks your set is trash or you have to deal with customer support.ALSO - EXCEL/SQL/other people who use the FUNCTION keys: those keys are speficifically harder to press down: different height different material different key resistance even smaller than typical LAPTOP function keys and the keyboard has a MANUAL FN toggle to use the alt funtions (mute etc).  Nightmare especially for a touch-typer who doesn't bother to look down to see what position to stupid slider is in. The two times I had longer manicured nails those keys were almost impossible to press.  WHYYY???  Finally the keypad stopped working before the dongle malfunctioned.  The critical flaws are mind-blowingly nonsensical compared to the otherwise great design.I got this several years ago Microsoft screwed up my return and I threw it in a closet. I'm trying to see if they will do the right thing and still replace this. I'd use it for personal use not work because of the FN key thing. I'll update the review if by some miracle they are decent.
3,The layout is perfect and I like having number pad separated from the keyboard.Over all happy with the Microsoft SculptThe only con was the manufacturing. After about a week of use I had to re-glue several of the key using gorilla glue. I had to order new clips for the YT and G keys as well. Once the keys were fixed everything worked as expected and I'm now happy with the keyboard.If your looking for a great design and don't mind doing a few repairs to get it set up the Sculpt is a good choice. You have to be very patient with the glue in order to not actually glue the key completely stopping movement. So think twice if you want something that works right off the shelf.
5,I wish I had purchased this sooner. I purchased it after suffering through a month of wrist pain stemming from switching to typing on a flat laptop keyboard. It didn't take long for the beginnings of carpal tunnel symptoms to appear. I'm hopeful that this ergonomic mouse and keyboard are now preventing further injury/damage. I originally didn't plan on getting the mouse but now it's actually my favorite part of this 3 piece package. It's so much more comfortable and enables my hand to remain relaxed while using it. Well worth the price for ease of use and overall comfort.
4,Wish they would put out a model with the tank-like construction of the 4000 with this mobility and form factor. I never use the keypad and my shoulder hates levering my arm past the keypad (been programming for 35 years if you include high school). The mouse is surprisingly good.
4,Keyboard is really great but wish the number pad was connected to the keyboard. Super disappointed in the mouse though - really miss my old MS natural ergonomic mouse. It was way more ergo than this one which I find hard to hold onto. Wish they would bring the old design back!
3,I have no problem with the product's ergonomic features or functionality. That part actually works fine. My problem is the detached number pad. I use the number pad Frequently and having it be detached it seems to always be out of reach or upside down. This is mostly caused by other non-number using members of the family and I liken it to trying to find the cordless phone handset or TV remote. I just find it annoying enough to rate this product as three stars.(My point is if you are an individual that needs the number pad on a regular basis buy an ergonomic keyboard with the attached number pad.)
4,I'm very pleased with this keyboard.  I like mechanical keyboards but find the split keyboard allows my wrists to remain in an ergonomically neutral position.  After retiring my original Microsoft Natural keyboard I tried a number of cordless keyboards that were just to "soft and mushy" to the touch.  While still not perfect I think it is the best out there and it is meeting my needs.  Would prefer to have the 10-key pad attached to the keyboard.  Even an option to attach it would be great.
3,This is a great design very sleek and works well if it works with your computer.  With the newest ultra thin laptops however that only have USB C this keyboard will not work consistently.  You will have to use a USB C dongle to regular USB or a dock.  For some reason Windows 10 will not recognize the device constantly.  It will work sometimes but then you leave your computer for a few minutes and all the sudden it's unrecognized.  I spent an hour and a half on the phone with microsoft tech support and they couldn't figure it out.  Had to go to a logitech which works just fine.
5,Great.  Microsoft was thinking on this one.  The keyboard is comfortable and types well.  I like the front riser as well.  The mouse is the truly awesome part of this package.  It is a bit odd at first but it becomes natural very quickly.  A separate number pad was an amazing idea.UPDATE: I recently re-purchased this keyboard.  They updated the function keys to work well with Windows 10.  They are very useful now.Pros:Very comfortable nice construction looks good very utilitarian.  Function keys map directly to useful Windows 10 features.Cons:Not many mainly the escape key sticks on and off.
2,So I really like this keyboard. The keys are nicely and clicky while remaining quiet enough to not annoy people. The ergonomics are great too. My hands and wrists have never been happier typing on this keyboard. Mouse is ok it works but I think it could be a better designed mouse. Slightly more vertical tilt and a better rest for the thumb.But unfortunately due to the fact that its permanently linked to a single USB dongle if you lose it? Or it gets damaged/destroyed? It's all useless. For $100 that's a grossly unacceptable point of failure. And of course it's been a year since I bought it so no warranty for me. >=\. Also I have a hard time agreeing with their decision to separate the number pad from the rest of the keyboard it just adds another battery I have to replace.I think they have a good keyboard to start with but I'd really like to see a redesign especially with the USB dongle not being linked like that. That just screams dumb design.
4,I love the light weight and responsive keys of this keyboard.  Not all of the mouses features work on OS X but you can get a few of them back by using a utility like BetterTouchTool to program the buttons.  I suspect this is Microsoft wanting to make their mouse special for windows 8.  If it worked seamlessly with OS X I would give it 5 stars.  It earns 4 stars for solid build quality accuracy and beautiful design (aesthetically and ergonomically).
5,Great ergonomic keyboard and mouse. They are very well built and feel great to use them
5,I’m using this keyboard with my Mac Book Pro and it works well. No problems. The mouse works well too. Comfortable. I had issues with double-clicking but it was set to too fast so once I reduced the double-click speed a bit it worked much better. Keyboard is comfy and I’ve had no wrist pain since starting to use it. I recommend it.
3,My experience with this keyboard is that the keys are really soft and press without much pressure.  This may be a selling point for some and as such is not really a defect.  I am sure in the age of noiseless keyboards this is the tradoff.  However I am constantly havint to hit esc or back on a spreadsheet as a "d" or row of them were entered into a cell without intent.  It is simply frustrating.  I would not buy this again and am looking for a different solution.
3,Only 3 stars because of the mouse.Keyboard: I really like the keyboard. Have the same one at work as well. Takes a couple of days of getting used to but once you do improves your typing speed substantially and makes sure your hands are not crossing over while typing. Also very comfortable resting position while typing.Mouse: It was great for the first couple of months. After that though the clicker has degraded and is having mechanical problems. Had to buy a separate mouse from Logitech to use cause even though the Microsoft mouse continued working the experience of using it was poor.
5,I own the original ergonomic keyboard at home (4000). The new wireless keyboard addresses the issues that I had with the previous one. The separate numeric pad is great since I rarely use it and the function keys problem is solved by the switch (so you cannot press it accidentally or have to reset it every time). The mouse took me some time to get used to but overall it was a great way to give my hands a break at work.The only problem that I had was a bit of interference with other electronic devices at work. It wasn't as much of a problem that I would reduce the overall score for it.
4,Great keyboard... I previously had a couple sets of the Logitech Curve.  While I loved their design for its natural feel.  Both sets would often have issues with sporadic window scrolling.  Enter the Microsoft Sculpt.  Its beautiful.  The mouse looks big but has a really comfortable feel.  I like the separate number pad.  My only grip is the keys feel a little wide.  Perhaps I'm still used to the Logitech keyboard.  I'm happy with the purchase.
4,I really liked the keyboard for typing. Unfortunately I do to much with the number pad and it wasn't a smooth fit. I kept it for the home office where it doesn't get that type of use. Biggest complaint is there is no Caplock indicator either on the keyboard or on the screen. The ADP system I use requires all caps and I am constantly switching between modes bouncing from ADP to emails. Then when you enter a blind password you aren't sure which mode you are in.
5,This is by far the best keyboard that I've used (I work in software). In the past I had RSI issues from typing. This keyboard in combination of good posture and strengthening the middle my back has made RSI thing of the past. There is a noticeable difference for me between using the keyboard and using the keyboard on my MacBook Pro. I think the only thing I want more is that if this were a Bluetooth keyboard.Regardless I've bought three - one for home the office and a third as backup.
5,I'd been using my keyboard on my laptop for a year and began suffering pain in my left elbow that radiated down my forearm affecting my ability to pick up even a water bottle.  Within days of using this keyboard and mouse the pain was greatly diminished.  I can now type pain-free and I'm just waiting for the residual inflammation in my arm to disappear.  Highly recommend! Oh and to reiterate the learning curve comments - yes there is quite a learning curve but totally worth it!
5,I learned of this keyboard/10 key/mouse at a prior employer. When I changed companies I couldn't not get/use this ergo system again. Worth every penny. Keys are light to touch so there's no pounding. The mouse is my favorite - easy glide and click. The 10 key is a must nothing better than using 10 key vs the typical keyboard numbers at the top of the letters.
3,Loved loved loved the keyboard and mouse combo once I got used to them but once the usb goes whole thing is useless.  Unless you are working from a desk and never move workstations you run the risk of having a totally useless keyboard if the usb won't work.  Comfort is great mouse is great.  If you leave the usb in and put your laptop in your laptop bag once it will never work the same again.  If Microsoft made this with a smaller or more durable usb like their other products this would be a non-issue.  As far as my keyboard and mouse are concerned did not even last a year.
1,The bluetooth dongle broke/failed in the first year. The encryption prevents replacing the dongle so I'm left with a costly paper weight. The outsourced customer service from Microsoft is overly cumbersome to say the least. I was passed from one person to the next over the course of around 90 minutes. The phone call was disconnected/dropped so I had to call and start the process over again. This time the person tried telling me there's nothing they can do and it was Amazon's problem. I requested another rep to help and continued being passed around again and again. I had a meeting so I couldn't finish the process. They made multiple "call attempts" to resolve and every time they called I answered my phone but they'd immediately hang up on me without responding to my greeting. I would receive an email after each call attempt stating they couldn't reach me but to reply back and they'd help. I replied back every time and even provided call logs to show I was answering. They never replied back to my emails. I was told to have Amazon replace it but it's a warranty issue so it's on Microsoft. Great product comfortable to use but not worth the risk of the dongle getting lost broken or failing because it cannot be replaced and Microsoft has terrible customer service. Don't buy.
5,It takes a few days for the keys to loosen but they will. This is easy typing no pain!
5,My favorite ergo keyboard to date. Keys are shallower distance than other Microsoft models and several other quality brands I've tried making it comfortable and much less clackitty. The taller delete key has a slightly different placement than is common. Not an issue though with regular use.Wireless keypad is convenient when moving to Word docs and email allowing the user to move it out and the mouse closer.I find the mouse that comes with the Microsoft 7000 keyboard slightly more comfortable because it's bigger but the mouse with this one more functional.
5,I've had the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic 4000 USB Keyboard since it was released and loved it but I wanted to go wireless for a sit/stand desk.  Had my concerns about the keypad being completely separate and whether I would like that but it has not been an issue.  I actually like that I can move the keypad out of the way and have more room on my sit/stand desk for just the keyboard and the mouse.
5,I'm a software developer so I spend all day and night staring at a computer screen. I used to use Logitech MX5000 desktop but wanted to try something more ergonomic. It takes some adjusting to but my wrists are much more comfortable now than they have been with any other keyboard I've used. The mouse is also odd at first but if you can force yourself to use it correctly it is amazing how much better it feels at the end of the day. I liked it so much I bought a second one for home use. If I had to place a warning about anything it is that it spoils you and makes traditional keyboards feel awkward.
4,I originally bought this at a local store but it was less expensive on Amazon.  I like the touch because it is close to my laptop.  I get a consistent feel from desktop to laptop now.  I have one at work and at home now.  If you haven't used an ergonomic keyboard (split/curved) it may take you a little bit to get used to it.  It is easier on your wrists elbows and shoulders.
3,I ordered this thinking it was larger for some reason i though it would be close to the size of the Microsoft 4000 ergo keyboard but it was much smaller.  Everything worked flawlessly but it was too small for what I needed it for.  I did love the mouse it was a bit odd but it was very nice the free floating 10-key worked well and was handy.  I ended up returning this item because the keyboard was a bit too small for me.  I should have read the descriptions a bit more carefully.One note it was surprisingly heavy for its size it didn't slide around when I set it on my desk it didn't move when i started typing on it.
1,I have always loved the microsoft ergonomical keyboard/mouse sets but this one is ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. If you are a proficient typist then DO NOT BUY THIS because:1. Your finger tips do not find the keys easily leaving you to frustration by needing to continuously needed to re position your fingers correctly.........Only to make another error and repeating this process. I used it for 3 days and still could not adjust to it.2. They separated the keypad into a stand alone device........which really seemed like a good idea........Until you actually use it. We are all familiar with the layout of a regular keyboard but this new idea really offsets your typing skills. It makes you clumsy and slows you down by needing to always look down to be sure your finger placemen is correct. The number keypad is easy to use...............so long as you can actually locate it. Again I used this for 3 days and could not accustom to it.3. Even though I could have easily returned it.....................I threw it in the trash because it created a great deal of frustration. I thought I was going to get used to using it.......BUT I DIDNT. I went back to amazon and orders another earlier version of Microsoft's wireless keybard/mouise set.............
4,it is a comfortable as expected yet it is a very basic keyboard a baklit would make it the best ever for exabmple. You will need a few hours to get used to the layout which is a bit different from the rest of keyboards but the shape and distribution and hand position will make it easier than you thought. Worth the purchase and it looks gorgeous on your desk
1,I'm typing this review on another keyboard and using another mouse because the Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic is in a freezing cycle.  The mouse will jump around and the keyboard has a delay and is missing typed keys.  Yes I've updated the drivers and yes I've checked the system load.  Both sets of keyboards and mice are connected at the same time. I even moved them all to the same USB hub.  Will the performance of the MS 4000 combo works flawlessly I can barely do anything with the Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic.  When working Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic performed great and looks very nice.  Also I did check the battery and replaced all of them.  After checking the forms I have seen I'm not the only one having this issue.  The fixes only resolved the issue for a short term or unnecessary reset/rebuild of the computer system.  Purchased Aug 2020.  Review Date Feb 2021
3,I LOVED this keyboard. It felt great; typing on it was so comfortable...BUT as soon as I turned on the mouse both the mouse and the keyboard went into a hair-tearing semi-paralysis.A partial solution was to turn off the mouse and use the keyboard with a wired mouse but there were still a few glitches--mostly "backspacing" out characters. And why keep a keyboard/mouse combo when only the keyboard (sort of) works. So I sadly bundled everything back in the box and am returning them.I'm going to order the keyboard version without the mouse and see if that works better with the hopes that this one was defective.
5,I am using this on my Macbook Pro - and it works great.  I have been a software consultant for a little over 20 years and my hands are starting to get bad carpal... This keyboard REALLY helps - is lightweight - meaning I can bring it with me/with my laptop (laptop keyboard hurts my hands/wrists). The only thing that would make this better is if it was blue-tooth - it uses a USB stick.Shipping and packaging was excellent.
3,I don't game so I am not scoring on that. I will say I love this keyboard except for one thing. The F5 key doesn't seem to hold up well. I have two of these keyboards and the F5 key is weak or sticks on both. I do database work and development and the F5 is how I execute commands on several tools.
5,A friend told me about this set and they loved it. Found it on sale here at Amazon. Batteries do run out that's a fact of life so yes they will eventually need to be replaced. As far as the keyboard. Totally awesome feel. It does take some getting use to as your hands and muscle memory have to set to the new angle and now your finger a rest on the keys. I would absolutely purchase this item again if and when the one I have fails. Buck stops here. Just do it you won't regret it.
5,Durable and works perfect
4,Takes awhile to get used to the shape but once you do it is comfortable to use.  One compliant is that there is a lag when you start typing which means the first key stroke is not registered and I have to go back and retype it.
4,The design is great the mouse is the best. The only ergo mouse that doesn't cramp my hand. The only problem I am experiencing is that it gets disconnected almost daily. I need to re-plug the dangle to get it working again.
4,If you come from using the 4000 this keyboard will take some time to adjust to. After that the feel is awesome specially if your 4000's keys are already loose and squishy. The mouse communication with the USB dongle is kinda crappy though so you better make sure there's a clear line between your PC and the mouse; I'm taking one star off because of that.
3,There are very few good ergonomic keyboard in the market Microsoft makes some of the best and this set is no exception... except for the usb receiver.  The build of the receiver is pretty fragile which is a big problem because if the receiver breaks your only options is to buy a completely new set.  It is sad to throw away the keyboard and mouse while they are still in perfect condition.  We still ended up buying this as replacement because it is still the best option in this price range.
3,What happened with the number pad?  Did the design team go for coffee and forget to make it ergonomic as well?  Like the keyboard It needs to also be raised and have a wrist rest.  I work with numbers all day and it is not comfortable.  I like the mouse and it is very comfortable.  I also like that this is compatible with my macbook pro.  Any suggestions or do you have a 6-inch wrist rest that would help with the mouse and number pad?SignedStill trying to get ergonomic with the ergonomic microsoft sculpt
4,Good
3,I liked this layout and found this to be the most comfortable keyboard I have had.  the mouse takes some getting used to because of the shape but after about 45 days the keyboard started to type double characters.  The fn switch would only give me the blue functions and when switched to regular the computer would fritz until switched back.  Also when used in Win 8 and you type a t it would automatically bring up the mail app.  Became unusable.  Tried to call MS but that ended up being hung up on by foreign tech's 3 times.  I will return to Amazon.
5,Purchased for a second computer.  REALLY like the ergonomic feed and LOVE having the separate calculator...it helps minimize the size of the keyboard which also has the number keys of course.  I enjoy having the calculator feature separate.  I use a different ergonomic ball mouse the Logitec M570 with it and they are a perfect combination for me.  All the attachments (battery cover and elevated front piece) attach magnetically... SO HANDY!
2,After a year + of use ergonomically this is a good choice - but it will age badly. I preferred MS's older split keyboard which was a bit more inclined and as for the mouse I preferred another model that was more tilted to the side (a "vertical" mouse). But the nice looks and a smaller foot-print of the keyboard made me purchase this combo for both the office and home. However after a year of use the "rubber" where the palm of your hand rests will become "white" due to use. The rubber parts on the mouse will have "blisters" and deformations on both sides. So after all you paid for a quality brand product and got something that will not look good after a few months of use. I expected better from Microsoft especially given the price paid.
5,This keyboard continues the great ergonomic qualities I fell in love with on the earlier Ergonomics Keyboard 4000.  It provides a level of comfort that I have not been able to find in any other keyboards I have tried.  This new keyboard has a great feel and keystrokes are crisp.  I tried two other keyboards before finding this one and it is hands down the best I have tried.  I don't know that separating the numeric keypad is the best for me since I use one often.  But it is a minor inconvenience and overall I would qualify the keyboard as a home run for its maker.
3,The shape and touch of this keyboard is absolutely the best I've ever used. Unfortunately they only last about a year. I purchased this keyboard on April 11 2019 and it was no longer usable by April 11 2020.If this keyboard wasn't this nice to use I wouldn't keep buying it with this kind of break-down problem. As it is be prepared to spend some time on the Microsoft warranty line if you want a replacement. You may also want to buy an extra warranty package.
2,I'm not a big fan of this keyboard.  I ended up returning it.  I think this is better for people who have wrist or shoulder pain.  The "ergonomics" won't help at all with hand pain or index finger pain which is my affliction.The mouse is a good concept but the design falls flat.  Its not vertical enough to really help much with wrist pain and the odd slant caused my hand to cramp up from having to hold it at an odd angle.  What is the point of having a windows button on the mouse especially now that we are done with windows 8?  The Anker vertical mouse is SO much better   Anker® 2.4G Wireless Vertical Ergonomic Optical Mouse 800 / 1200 /1600DPI 5 Buttons - Black        .The keyboard is okay but the clicks are just so unresponsive.  A laptop keyboard which it is compared to actually feels much nicer and lighter.On the positive side the build quality plastics and aesthetics are all very nice.  But that's just not enough.
5,I have mild carpal tunnel.  This keyboard fixed it.  It's the mouse for me.  Mouse is available separately (save money).
4,I do prefer this keyboard over the longer travel keys.  I find I make less typing mistakes.Weaknesses: The position of the home end and arrow keys aren't great.  I use these a lot when writing software code and editing docs and the arrangement isn't easy to use without looking at them.  I'm not keen with using a button cell for batteries for the numeric pad.But overall I would not go back to using my old keyboard (also a high-end Microsoft model).
1,[UPDATE]Beware! If something happens to the USB transceiver you will be on your own. My transceiver snapped in half when I was taking my laptop out of its bag. I went online to try to purchase a replacement transceiver. Researching I found that Microsoft DOES NOT offer replacement transceivers. I called Microsoft support the support person told me they could not do anything about it. I would have to get a whole new set. The options they gave me was #1 Get a different cheaper model from them IF MY WARRANTY HASN'T EXPIRED (They said this model has been DISCONTINUED!?) #2 Buy a whole new set on my own. I am so disappointed that I have wasted $100 on this keyboard just so the cheaply made transceiver can break in half. BUY A LOGITECH THEY OFFER REPLACEMENT TRANSCEIVERS!! I am never buying keyboard or mouses from Microsoft again. This is ridiculous how often people lose their USB transceivers and Microsoft can't even offer replacements?[ORIGINAL]This keyboard is comfy. Really comfy. It takes a few hours to get adjusted to the shape compared to other flat keyboards but it is awesome. It looks premium feels premium. The mouse is indeed very comfortable as well. Don't let the looks scare you. This keyboard and mouse are made for productivity. And it is also cool looking. The only thing missing are the function keys to play next or previous songs.
2,I really like the look and feel of this keyboard and it worked fine for a few weeks but then the keyboard started stalling I would type and there would be a lag and not all of the characters would type or it wouldn't type at all. I tried new batteries same thing. Tried reconnecting it same thing. There seems to be something wrong with the bluetooth connection of the keyboard the mouse is working fine. It will go stretches of a couple hours working fine and then it will go days where it is totally spotty and only works perfectly a couple minutes out of the day.I contacted seller about this issue and they said to contact Amazon because they shipped the item. I responded and said it wasn't an issue with the delivery or anything but the product itself and never heard back. Pretty big bummer. I would have liked to try out a replacement. I think there's just something wrong with my keyboard specifically since a lot of the other reviews are good.
4,The idea of a separate number pad is probably better than actual usage.  I thought wow what a great idea but you start to realize after using that you now have to hunt for the number pad because it's not always exactly at about the same spot as your keyboard.  But if you don't use the num pad often i guess it's a space saver
5,As much as I type I needed something to for comfort especially since I am at the beginning stages for carpal tunnelI was weary of this design but it has worked out great!  I am very pleased
3,I've been very dedicated to the Microsoft Comfort keyboard but unhappy with its presentation of the number keypad (no clear key). I thought this would solve the issue - a separate keypad! Instead I find that this keyboard was built with men in mind. It requires a tiring amount of reach and the hand position required is too wide. I cannot even reach the backspace and delete keys. The mouse is a great big ball - way too big - requiring my hand to hover in air. Not recommended for small people. (I am an average size woman. 5'6")
2,Frustrating. Great ergo design and love that the mouse can track on hard surfaces but major issues with the receiver which isn't replaceable. I've been through 2 sets in less than a year so I'm done despite how much I love the design.On the first set the receiver just fell apart one time as I removed it from the USB port. I hadn't purchased any sort of warranty or insurance. I bought a second set... unwisely. On both sets I found that I often had to remove and reinsert the receiver over and over trying all available USB slots until it would work... eventually. I'm able to plug in another wireless mouse and receiver and have that work just fine so this is an accessory issue not an issue with my laptop/dock.I did buy the warranty on the second set but not sure I will bother with a replacement if it's just going to crap out on me in months yet again.I would recommend buying a more stable product with a universal/replaceable receiver.
3,Nicely designed keyboard and mouse but the numbers keypad skips and has become increasingly unreliable and basically unworkable.I have replaced the batteries (which were an obscure variety and hard to find) and cleaned it and the thing is still pretty useless.Maybe I just got a lemon but it wasn't cheap and I'm pretty disappointed.
1,For the price I believe the keyboard should work for more than a year or so. My keyboard has started malfunctioning in weird ways not described on product support pages. The Alt and Tab keys each work separately but I can't use Alt+Tab to change windows anymore. Likewise Shift and the number 1 both work independently but I can't type an exclamation point. I don't understand why it's specifically keystroke combinations that stopped working. I tried restarting my computer and replacing the battery in the keyboard but there was no change. I tried to call Microsoft to troubleshoot this specific problem and the automatic voice message informed me that they "moved their support online" which just means a bunch of customer forums you would have to search through endlessly for problems that are different from the one you're experiencing. Microsoft can go take a leap off a cliff if they think that counts as customer service. For such a pricey product it's a hunk of junk with no support team.
4,nowadays keyboards should all  be back lit.  there is some getting used to with it but I am a wide person and without the number pad the main keyboard is the size of a standard keyboard but its only letters and much more comfortable.  I am getting used to using the numbers in the top row.just really wish I had an option for back lit.
3,Bought this for my Office Manager/Bookkeeper. She was so accustomed to the 10 key attached to the keyboard that the detached 10 key ended up being an inconvenience. Other than that solid hardware and very ergonomic.
5,I've used this keyboard mouse. and 10 key setup for years and love the durability. The Palm rest of the keyboard can wear out over time but overall i'm a big fan. The mouse is probably the biggest selling point as the ergonomics on it are fantastic. The 10 key doesn't work with the hotkeys on a Mac setup which is a major downside for me personally.
4,I am very conflicted about this set. On one hand it is genius - bundling the numb pad separately I mean. The keys though not mechanical are very high quality. On the other hand the mouse is horrible and not ergonomic.I ultimately returned it because even the ergo professional who checked out my desk said the mouse was not ergonomic (and because I couldn't master the art of the split keypad).
5,So I've only had this for two day's now but I LOVE it.  My previous keyboard/mouse combo was always lagging.  I even got a USB extender so I could put it's connector within 12-15 inches from the keyboard/mouse but it didn't do any good.  With this new setup I plugged it directly into my docking station which is about four feet away and haven't had one issue with lagging for either the keyboard or mouse.The keyboard is very comfortable and so is the mouse.  They take up less space than my previous setup and so far they're working great.
4,The ergonomics are great and the wireless works really well too. Almost no lag. I do have a couple small complaints though: the escape key and all the function keys are stiffer and less mechanical when you press them. Also I would have liked for the Home End and Page Up/Down keys to be positioned like they normally are (with the Delete and Insert keys).Still this works very well and after I'm done adjusting  to the key layout I don't anticipate having any complaints!
1,Very laggy Bluetooth doesn’t work well at all. Have to place the dongle within inches of the keyboard for it to work
3,Well we might rate it more highly . . . when we finally figure out how to hook it up to the T.V. console we've bought this for.We've now invested nearly two hours trying to figure this thing out ... WITHOUT A SINGLE WORD (in ANY language) in print about how to operate this set!?!  That's right we even called Microsoft technical support and not only were we informed that there has been NO instruction manual produced for this product they couldn't even help us figure out how to activate it.  Our guess was as good as theirs as it turned out.
5,I type for about eight hours a day straight and it was taking a toll on my fingers and wrists. I saw someone else in my office had this and I decided to give it a try. It's awesome. No more wrist pain or finger cramping! I will say that there was definitely a learning curve relearning how to type with my hands in different positions but after about a week it was second nature. Definitely worth it.
5,I have had wrist surgery and find flat keyboards very uncomfortable. I have used this keyboard for over six months and find it the best one yet. It did take about a week to get used to but I love it. I am getting a second one for home use. I have had no problems with keys sticking as mentioned by other reviewers. I find the design improves my touch typing and I have to look at the keyboard less. I do use it with th keyboard lift. I like that it is easily removable so others can use it or not.
2,Like many users I have two of these sets  one for work and one for home.  One day  the keyboard would stop working randomly  (booth of my sets do this).  Changing the batteries seemed to help and things were fine.  Then the next day  the keyboard would act as the keyboard was stuck and then die.  Now the death would occur every few minutes.  I tested different drivers and different computers.  One keyboard works fine  the other is a mess.I also see that the price has jumped because Microsoft has stopped selling the unit themselves.  Beware!
5,Really like this keyboard. The keys are great the shape is great and unlike some other ergonomic keyboards it fits in my desk with the keyboard tray closed. The mouse is also very good love the feel of it and is very comfortable much better than a regular mouse. If I had one thing to not like much it would be the separate keypad. I don't really use it much anyway so not really a big deal for me though.
4,Excellent ergonomics. Only wish there was a way to do wireless without the USB fob. If you lose/break the transciever you must replace the entire set. Unfortunately for me it broke just out of the 3 year warranty so I was stuck buying the whole thing over. But I did because it's my preferred wireless egronomic keyboard.
5,At least for my daughter who likes to game and needs and ergo board.  She loves it.
5,I absolutely love this keyboard and mouse.  There are some things when you purchase them you think "this is the best ever."  Well this is one of those purchases.  It looks sleek it has a good feel to it and I love that I can move the number pad out of my way if I don't need it. The curve and size of the mouse is perfect and relieves all the stress on my wrist.
1,UPDATED REVIEW (March 2019):After just a little more than one year my keyboard and mouse are completely useless. With normal (not even every day) use of the set the USB has failed with the casing popping open. It no longer works and from what I've read I cannot get a replacement USB receiver. I love the design and feel of the keyboard and mouse - but that does me no good when I can't use them. VERY inconvenient when I'm in the middle of a jammed day of work. Microsoft FAIL.Initial Review (January 2018):I was using a much older version of the Microsoft ergo keyboard and I LOVE this new one!!! The design is simple and sleek and doesn't take up as much space as the old version. I like that the keypad isn't attached as it leaves me the flexibility of saving space for the mouse and putting it away when not needed. I also like that it uses magnets to attach the wrist riser as well as both of the battery covers. The mouse is really different than ones I've used in the past but set up was easy it fits comfortably in my palm and I'm sure I'll be used to it in no time. I'll be getting a second one for the office!
5,For a variety of reasons I have a number of keyboards and I 'switch' from one to another to be sure my hands are placed in different positions.  I read the reviews of this keyboard that ranged from wonderful to terrible . . . for me I love this keyboard.  It is certainly different with a separate keypad but I quickly adapted to the keyspread.  Unlike others I also like the mouse . . . a very different shape to be sure but one that fits my hand quite well.I've been using this combination for most of the week and truly really like it.
1,Let me start by saying that I love the feel of this mouse and keyboard combo. Really my favorite design I've tried out recently to the point where I bought one for work one for home and another as a gift. However at this time I have to give this a negative review and a recommendation that you do not purchase. The USB dongles are extremely fragile on these devices. I had mine break while was sitting in my laptop bag in an otherwise empty pocket. I am not rough on my electronics.Here is the real problem- Microsoft does just about nothing to support these devices. If the USB dongle breaks they DO NOT sell replacement ones. If you buy other brands like Logitech they have models that can be reassigned to a different dongle if yours is lost or broken. Support was useless when I called for help as they are with most lower price hardware issues (expected).Until they offer some way of addressing this issue I highly recommend you either stay away or plan on paying full price for a replacement if there are any issues (which conveniently seem to happen outside of the 30 days...If you do get one you'll probably love it like I did until it breaks and becomes a very expensive set of bricks.
5,Have to admit I bought this first and foremost based on it's attractiveness.  Was looking for an ergonomic split keyboard but wasn't crazy about the bulk of most others.  I have come to love it as it's super comfortable - ergonomics of it are superb!  Wasn't crazy about the mouse before it arrived but I have come to love that as well.  The keys are the perfect light click that I've come to appreciate on many newer keyboards.  A super comfortable set and when I get myself set up with a computer at home I will totally purchase a second set!
5,Was a gift.
5,Every few years I upgrade to the latest ergo wireless keyboard.  I research the best and prices and always end up with Microsoft brand.  This one however is my favorite I have ever owned.  I love the separate 10-key pad.  I grab it on my way to meetings and always get comments on having a 10 keypad versus using the laptop keypad.  It's design is sleek easy to clean super lightweight.
3,I like the design of the mouse keyboard and detached number pad. All look great and feel nice to use. Only problem is I purchased these items 5 months ago and just recently started using it only to find out the keys stick. Especially er t uo i and space bar. I use this for work and speed matters when typing. Unfortunately these sticky keys cause me correct errors too often. If you type slow and like to hit every key hard then this is the keyboard for you.
4,After 2 years the mouse just stopped working properly... I only use this at work so it is not being put through gaming. Really disappointed.
5,Good keyboard and very quiet. Sensitive to touch. However after about a year I see the wear marks on the left side of the keyboard elbow resting pad. It shows gray to white wear. Initially thought may be dirt however cleaning with a damp water did not help. The right hand side is still looking good. I am not deducting any stars as it is still my go to keyboard when I need to work during the nights.
5,I went to a standing/sitting desk decided I needed to go ergo.... so off went my mechanical Corsair and on came the Microsoft Sculpt Ergo....and I love it! Very comfortable easy to adjust to and just feels right. Looks brilliant on the new desk to boot! The mouse like most say is like a bed knob but strangely comfortable I actually bought the combo with the intention of replacing the mouse with a wireless Logitech but I have grow fond of this mouse!
2,This keyboard while EXCELLENT in so many ways falls short on a few. I've deployed dozens of these over the years and here is my two-cents.The separate 10-key uses a coin battery that can die at anytime. No indicator of battery life.The keyboard itself requires a VERY specific dongle that MUST be paired with the EXACT keyboard that shipped with it. DO NOT mix the adapters up or lose them otherwise you have to get a whole new keyboard set instead of replacing just the adapter (like with Logitech devices)
1,I love the mouse that comes with Sculpt and might have paid the price of the three pieces for it alone but the rest is a disaster. The concept of a separate keypad is fine and the ergonomics of the keyboard are very good but in use they both failed miserably. The keyboard had an irritating squeak in the right space bar from day one - I should have returned it at that point. after a month or two the keypad stopped working. The flathead screwdriver slit in the battery cover is MADDENING - screwdriver after screwdriver wouldn't fit it. I finally found one that worked if I did it very very gingerly. Really Microsoft?! You can't design a flathead screw slot? Did you even test it? Once the cover was off it was almost impossible to get the battery out because part of the case covered part of the battery and a metal tab covered another part. It has a screw-on cover Microsoft does it really need two impossible-to-use grippers too? I finally got it out and got the replacement battery in then very gingerly screwed the cover back on - and then it didn't work. Two days later the keyboard quit and I didn't even try; I just dug out an old cheap unergonomic keyboard with keypad that actually works and switched to that. I'll keep the mouse but this product is not ready for prime time by a long shot.
5,Having the 10 key separate is awesome.
3,Good product... great for those that use for word processing and not having to mess with number's pad. BAD execution don't ever unplug the USB receiver because it won't work afterwards.  I have two of these one on desktop and works great... and the mouse is okay too... not sure what those others are complaining about. But the other one on the laptop worked about two times and then it was gone after the USB receiver failed... VERY FRUSTRATING but you soon learn there is not another one that is built like this one.
5,I love that the keyboard is split but not huge that it takes over the desk space. I LOVE that the key pad is separate and has a calculator that pops up on the screen. I no longer use my calculator providing even more desk space. . GENIUS. I've always wanted to tilt the key pad on the keyboard which is impossible or move it to the left side. I can do both. Super!! I AND it's wireless creating less clutter almost too good to be true. It absolutely has all the things I've always thought a keyboard should have in one! Have one at work and home.
1,I've indeed brought two sets of this product (one for me and one for my wife) about one year ago. When the product does not break it is really good. The problem is: it breaks too fast :(Both sets (keyboard + mouse) have problems:Set 1 (breaks in 1 year)- keyboard: left space not working- mouse: left button sometimes work and sometimes does not. It happens so frequently that the mouse is not usable.Set 2 (breaks in half year):- mouse: the same problem as set 1.In summary  only one keyboard is usable after two set of this product.
5,Arrived on time and undamaged. Replacing a wired ergonomic keyboard & mouse. A slightly different layout than I'm accustomed to most notably with a separate number pad. I've used MS ergonomic keyboards exclusively since '99 and my only issue with them is their delicacy. A bit of spilled soda is just about an instant killer. At $50+ a pop they're not cheap but nothing else comes close to ease of use. I generally keep a spare on hand.
5,Do not get along well without an ergonomic keyboard and mouse and this is one of the best. I have been using Microsoft Keyboards for a long time and this on is no different. Easy to use and my hands just naturally fall correctly and I do not have any hand/finger problems. The mouse is great because it is a bit larger than what I was using and it is easy to handle and east to use.
5,I have been using the keyboard and mouse for a week. The keys are comfortably placed and have a good feel to them. It took a couple of days to become used to the shape but now I love it. The mouse is also worthwhile. I have used many different mice but this one is very comfortable and the shape helps the wrist position. Initially I was planning on buying a less expensive ergonomic board but I am please I did some research and read a lot of reviews before buying.
5,Ok I am a fan of ergo keyboards and have not found a good one in a while this is a great set I love the small space the keyboard takes due to the detached number pad I enjoy the detached number pad as well because my wife works in finance and I can just hand it to her lol.  The mouse is good feeling and does reduce fatigue however I use my mouse when I play games and it was not so good there but this is not a gaming set.
4,The keyboard is easier to adjust to than other ergonomic ones I have used.  Both the mouse and keyboard felt very natural to use.  I have had a number of people complain about how "weird" they feel but none of those people have ever liked any ergonomic keyboard/mouse.  My main complaint with this setup is the detached number pad.  It always seems to be moving around on my desk and competing for space with my mouse.
4,Took a little while getting used to but it fits nice. I love how the numeric keypad is separate so you can move it out of the way unless you need to use it. The mouse isn't super comfortable but it does the job.
3,Love the touch and layout of the keyboard. I touch-type better on this one than on any keyboard I've had. The mouse is ergonomically comfortable as well. The shortcoming is in the disconnected keypad. As an accountant I use the keypad constantly. Not having a fixed location for it in reference to the keyboard means looking away from whatever I'm doing in order to orient my fingers. The tiny ridge on the 5 button meant to help in this process is too small to readily identify by touch. It takes some searching to feel it. There is much I love about this set but I must reluctantly try something else.
5,Excellent keyboard as others have said. I ordered one of these for my development machine at work in August of 2015. I ordered another in January and the key layout has changed. The volume keys are now on the RIGHT side next to the "PrtScn" button. It's quite annoying switching back between the two layouts.WARNING: THE KEYBOARD LAYOUT I RECEIVED WAS DIFFERENT THAN PICTURED.(The volume controls are on the right hand side next to "PrtScn")
4,Good keyboard and mouse for work. I can type comfortably on it without making the ruckus that is my mechanical keyboard. keys are large pads not for someone with small hands mine are fairly big so its great for me but my wife didn't like it.
4,This is a good replacement to their discontinued Ergonomic keyboard/mouse set. This new model feels and looks less bulky and has a detached keypad. the curvature of the keyboard is great and it has a nice high tech open middle design.One problem with this unit is that the mouse has a glossy coating and after a day of use the mouse looks real ugly with palm smudges.
4,I bought this to replace a MS 4000 wireless set that is out of production for years.Has a very MacBook feel to the keys.  The only thing I don't care for is the lack of dedicated media keys. Instead the Fkeys do dual purpose with a SLIDE SWITCH to decide instead of another modifier key to press.
5,Using this with my new MacBook 15" 2017.  Feels and looks great.  Works fine right out of the box with my MacBook.  Obviously you have to mentally map the command and option keys to the windows and alt keys respectively.  I really love this keyboard.  I also really like having the numeric keypad (which I never ever use) separate keeping the main keyboard smaller profile.
4,Love the keyboard / number pad...HATE THE MOUSE.  Microsoft can never seem to get the mouse right.  Typing on the keyboard is great and very easy to use.  As with all other MS keyboard / mouse combo I've ever bought the mouse goes into a junk drawer and I use a Logitech mouse.  The mouse on this set it like using a tennis ball.  It seems like if it had been less round and lower profile it may have worked.
2,I originally marked this kb higher but after using for months now I have changed my opinion.  I thought I could get used to having the numeric pad separate but I don't like it taking up additional space.  I am keyboard on the lap person.I also do not like the function keys.  They are not raised high enough and for some reason feel a bit sticky forcing me to hit a few times.After receiving this keyboard I noticed more typos.  I thought it was me getting used to the kb but turns out there is sometimes a delay like it can't keep up with my speed of typing.  Other times it will type a letter multiple times as if I hold down too long on a key.Just not a happy camper with this keyboard.  I will go back to my wired.
1,For several years I have purchased Logitech wireless keyboards and mouses so this time around I got the great idea to try this microsoft L5V-00001 Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop Keyboard and mouse which gives the appearance of being top of the line quality and superior productivity...  the keyboard look clean with the separate number pad and decent mouse...however looks are deceiving...the keyboard is a piece of crap... if you notice "m" is not capitalized in this entire review; and that is because there is a very stupid and annoy glitch in this product which is when you hit shift to make a capital "m" it opens a shortcut to devices (play print & projects) instead... while I wrote this review I opened that "m" short cut 3 times...I believe it is defective (obviously) but its past the 30 days to return/exchange; since this damn thing costs so much money I am going to reach out to Amazon and microshaft to see what can be done about getting a replacement/exchange.  If they work with me or not I'll up update this review with their response or lack thereof.there is yet another issue... this keyboard burns through batteries fast my Logitech last 3-4 months where as this microshaft keyboard lasts less than a month with the less use.
3,I’ve had this less than a year and it’s already broken.... the main keys (ASDFGHJKL) all stopped working. I’ve even changed the batteries but nothing seems to get those keys to work...
4,I like it a lot but I can't tell when the capital button is off or on (no light).  Also is temperamental is I am leaning in or over the keyboard as is the mouse.  Wish it had a wired option to help with lost signals at times.
4,Bought the keyboard for my wife "carpal-tunnel" she loves the design and feel of the keyboard the mouse it comfortable to use but she feels the keyboard should have a better option to adjust the height instead of the bar available. Over-all she is very happy with the poduct.
4,I love the feel of the Sculpt Ergonomic keyboard. I have one complaint how can Microsoft offer a sculpt mouse that is for RIGHT-HAND only and not state that specification in their description. I am shock at the lack of consideration for the left-hand by a technology company in the 21st century! I tried using the mouse but it activates my trigger response on the thumb of MY LEFT HAND! Very disappointing.
1,I love the ergonomics but that's about it. I had to go through 2 of these in 3 years. issues I faced are as below:1) On the first one the dongle that connects the unit to computer stopped working. I had to constantly adjust it so that the keyboard gets connected. but then in again about 5-10 min it would lose connection. got tired of it and decided to buy another one.2) 2nd unit the keyboard stopped working. giving the benefit of the doubt changed the batteries but no use. now I have 2 of these units lying next to my desk. I have another one from a different company (don't want to mention the name as I do not want you all to think I am advertising for the other) since 5 years and that thing doesn't want to die.2 of my colleagues have the same issue and they are also tired of it. so it's not just 2 units I saw but I have seen about 4 units of this product and all turned out to be crappy. I would never buy this product again.If you don't mind buying this every year then go ahead and get one.
5,After trying many many keyboards I have to say this one will give you the best bang for the buck.  For development work however the placement of the delete end home page up and page down keys takes a bit of getting used to.  I wish there had been a little better placement of the page up and page down keys for navigating source code.
4,A great wireless keyboard and mouse. I really like the idea that the number pad is separated from the keyboard. Only down side is that the keyboard number pad and mouse all use different battery types.
3,super comfortable and quiet keyboard.major downside- if you ever lose or damage the dongle (usb connector) you are screwed.  Unlike Logitech Microsoft has made the idiotic design decision to connect each keyboard/mouse to a specific dongle which means if you lose it you have to buy an entire new set.  And the landfill gets a huge piece of garbage.  Microsoft should be a much better steward than that.  Great product with a horrible design flaw.
1,This keyboard has a great design and function for my typing preference but two major problems.  It suddenly stopped working 1 year after purchase and I couldn't get any meaningful help from Microsoft to get a replacement.  The warranty is 3 years but that's not helpful if you can't use it.  Additionally you can't replace one part. My mouse stopped working which made the keyboard and dongle worthless.  Why doesn't Microsoft allow you to replace the one defective part?  Disappointed.  Frustrated.
3,I like the comfortability when using the mouse and keyboard. I really enjoy using it!  However this ergonomic set does not seem to be compatible to my laptop even though the specs state it should be.  I haven't been able to use either keyboard or my mouse on multiple occasions due to this issue.  Our IT department has been trying to contact Microsoft support to resolve the issue but that has been difficult also.
4,I really like the feel of this keyboard. I got it for work. Nice smooth typing. I would have preferred the 10-key be attached. The other thing I like is it fits in the messenger-style laptop bag I use. So I can take the keyboard home when I have to work from home.
5,Purchased this keyboard and mouse combo for work works perfectly no fatigue on the the wrists. Some reviews have mentioned that the mouse will eventually show wear but I have not seen this issue. Battery life is good haven’t had the need to change out the batteries yet.
2,The product worked great. Light weight long battery life and extremely comfortable to use. I lost the dongle moving into a new place and it can't be replaced. I would have to buy another set. If you are prone to breaking or losing them maybe go with Logitech or another company that has a feature similar to Unifying.
2,Updated review: One of the keys popped off while I was typing and couldn't be put back in because one of the brackets had broken off. I thought this would be covered by their warranty under "defective materials" but when I called in they told me that I was pretty much SOL because it's not considered defective but damaged.None of my Logitech keyboards had ever done this to me and they all lasted for years (a couple even lasted for 10+ years). I guess I'm going back to Logitech keyboards since I can't type without the 'O' key in place.Also my F5 button has a tendency of getting stuck.Original review: A little awkward to use at first especially the mouse. But after I got used to it it feels awkward for me to use a regular keyboard.I prefer this a lot more now.
2,I bought this thing because the wirecutter loves it and it seems to have got good reviews generally. I found it a pain to use with my new macbook. I have a keyboard platform that rolls out from under my desk surface and find that the wireless does not reach the receiver even when the laptop is resting right on top of the desk. Also the mouse often gets miscalibrated and sends the cursor flying way off the screen. The hand rest is nice but it is not removable. Takes up too much space on my typing return and I have to pull the drawer out all the way to get proper reception. This puts me too far from the screen. It's taken me a little too long to figure this out and too late to return it now but if you have a keyboard drawer setup think twice about buying this product.
4,love the design and the overall look and feel.  Couple small negatives - battery cover on the number pad is flimsy.  Would be ideal if there was a better designed cover.  Also keyboard is slow to activate on windows startup.  I purchased 2 of them and satisfied overall.
2,After using this keyboard for several weeks I've discovered the lack of a separate "Fn" key to allow typists to switch between the two actions assigned to each of the 12 function keys is beyond maddening. Typists must use the physical switch in the upper right hand corner of the keyboard to go back and forth between the two actions assigned to each key. This is by far the absolute WORST design for double-use function keys I have ever seen on any keyboard anywhere. Even my $10 keyboard from eBay has a "Fn" key. I cannot imagine the thought process behind this amazingly stupid design decision. It escapes any sense of reason and logic. In fact this single design disaster alone takes this keyboard from five stars down to only two and even that is a bit of a gift. The person who designed this should be fired and banished from the design world for the rest of his/her miserable existence.
1,Although this keyboard and mouse are pretty decent per se I find it very hard to recommend inasmuch as it suffers from very poor customer orientation in the engineering. It is hard to conceive why MS engineers the wireless interface so poorly with connectivity hardwired at the factory and not subsequently pairable to say a replacement mouse. I dropped the mouse off my desk onto a carpeted floor something that I have on rare occasions in the past done with other mice. This time it was different in two ways: 1) The mouse barely survived the fall and subsequently operated so poorly that I had to replace it. So I replaced with an identical mouse purchased as a stand-alone item. 2) But the new mouse would not be recognized by the bluetooth dongle and so far as I was able to ascertain after much web browsing there is no way to achieve such pairing. I have to admit I was astonished. In the past with other brands (and with even smaller dongles) I have found after-purchase pairing to be a regular feature. I knock this down to a "poor" on the basis of what seems to me inept soft engineering of the hardware. Lamentable because it is an otherwise nice piece of hardware. I will look elsewhere in the future.
5,After a fall down the stairs and injuring my thumb. This has saved me at work!! Love this thing!!
5,This is a great keyboard. It took a little getting used to but now it's easy and a standard keyboard feels odd. I spend a lot of time at my desk and I have this keyboard and mouse set for my desks at work and home.
1,I've been using the keyboard for about 2 years now it replaced the old-style white Microsoft Natural keyboard (wired). I don't use the mouse much as I have an Evoluent mouse which I prefer (easier on the arm when you have RSI). As for the keyboard. I love it. Just one minor irritation. There is no visual indicator to alert you if the "Caps Lock" has been pressed or not. Especially annoying when you enter a password that does not show on the screen. Apart from that I recommend this keyboard and would buy it again. Again it is more easy on the arms.21/04/2017 I am changing my rating to 1-star from 5. My keyboard just stopped working all of a sudden today. Thought it was the batteries but no. I pulled the USB dongle out and i was so hot I could hardly touch it. It fried! Very disappointed through no fault of my own I loved the keyboard - while it worked. But what a terrible waste that you have to throw the whole set away when the $1 dongle quits. Unlike Logitech the Microsoft Dongle cannot be replaceable! That is irresponsible design Microsoft !!!
1,This keyboard was almost bearable right up until I have to pull the batteries out every second sentence I type.It is a bad design and jamming stuff in there doesn’t help keep the batteries in place.Just ordered another Logitech curved keyboard which is far better quality and comfortDon’t waste your money on this one.
5,I've been dealing with carpal tunnel and tried other ergonomic keyboards with no success.  While it's not gotten entirely rid of my carpal tunnel issues entirely it's made a significant difference for me.  Mouse is amazing.  Worth the money spent.  Coworker with similar issues tried the keyboard as well and it made a difference for her too.
2,The keyboard is designed so that the hand position is as it should be to reduce stress.  The mouse is another story.  The mouse  is a large domed device perfect for the hands of a professional basketball player perhaps but not for the rest of us with small or medium sized hands.  I am actually developing a sore wrist from this (in my opinion) poorly designed and constructed mouse.  From day one the left mouse button did not engage smoothly.  I have to place my finger at the very front of the mouse and push down at that point.  Even with that it sometimes does not yield without pressure.  Perhaps the button is an isolated issue with my mouse but the overall  design is not.  I like Microsoft's products in general but I would never buy this keyboard/mouse combo again or recommend this product to my friends solely because of the mouse.
5,This keyboard and mouse combination works flawlessly and worth the money. I spend hours daily typing and was beginning to develop pain in my wrists. I don't have that problem now due to the design of the keyboard. The keyboard takes a minute to get used to and the shift key should be larger but that is a minor quibble.The mouse fits the hand well and works great. Highly recommended
4,well made keyboard. The split in the keys for ergonomics takes some getting used to for me as I am used to a regular keyboard. I was having some wrist issues and this set up has helped alot.
4,Very ergonomic. No leraning curve if you are used to qwerty keyboards except the delete button which I prefer should be at the top right.Love the magnetic battery covers and keyboard raiser.Would have given 5 stars if they didnt change some the key's placements.
3,I couldn't get used to it. I had a regular keyboard and mouse for my desktop PC and i guess i was too adjusted to that to switch to the ergonomic. I liked the idea of the separated number pad but i hated using it. the middle of the keyboard rises up like mist ergonomic keyboards do but you see that gap the center is basically floating and its bouncy to type on. the mouse was way too bulky and awkward  too. it seems like a great quality and was well made. just not for me. besides i wanted a keyboard that has back-lit keys and this doesn't.
5,This is my second time purchasing this keyboard but this time I opted for the mouse as well.  It was nothing that happened to it that was due to mechanical defect or workmanship that caused me to have repurchase this item.  However when mine was destroyed by coffee and was using a regular keyboard and mouse I realized quickly how important an ergonomic keyboard is.
4,Great keyboard. It does take a little while to get used to the chiclet style keys. The wrist rest collects dust more than I would like. I can't speak about the strange mouse as I replaced it immediately with a Logitech trackball.
5,Works great on my Mac and PC. Love the style and the magnetic lock system on the battery slots and keyboard support. Feels natural to type with and I enjoy the flexible arrangement options. First ergonomic keyboard pretty good price when compared to Apple’s magic mouse/keyboard and I’m overall happy with my purchase.
4,It’s pretty good. Seller was awesome. Accepted my return promptly.  Highly recommend the seller
5,Awesome true state of the art.They finally improved the mouse to have a thumb backpage button.20 years after windows MS finally perfected the keyboard.LOVE NOT having the seldom used (for me) numerical keypad taking up space and forcing the mousepad to be so far to the right as to cause strain to wrist and shoulder.  Love being able to pull it out only when I need it. Also terrific that all three run wireless from the SAME  USB.
5,My hands don't hurt anymore! I bought this because my hands will ache after a day or so typing and working a mouse. This product has the ergonomic mouse and keyboard as part of the package. If the older wave keyboard came as a set I may have considered that product. The sculpt is a little more money but well worth it since the package contains both. As for results- My Aching hands are better. This keyboard and mouse keeps my joints in the correct positions so my hands and wrists aren't aggravated.
2,I buy them and use it everywhere and wear them out.  This is my fifth one since ~2010ish and have 3 actively in use.They wear out... or perhaps I wear them out.  I give it two stars since Microsoft has not modernized this line since 2010 and still requires a usb 2.0 dongle.  :facePalm:
2,I had an older Microsoft Ergonomic keyboard at work for years and loved it. But they're so HUGE so when I saw this more slim version and wireless I got excited and ordered it. But the feel of this keyboard is WAY different. I'd already gotten used to Apple chicklet keys and those are totally fine for me now. But these have a way too light feel to them that I couldn't get used to. And worse yet the function keys which I tend to use quite a bit don't always work unless you give them a REAL GOOD PRESS. In fact they have some tactile feedback that very clearly tells your finger "Yep you pressed me!" but then the key press doesn't actually register half the time. I'm returning this and hoping a new generation comes out that fixes these problems someday.
4,Love the keyboard.  Very solid feeling and very comfortable.  Deducted one star because I did not like the mouse and don't find the form of it comfortable at all.  But this combo is only like $5 more than the just keyboard so figured I would try it out.
1,This keyboard is junk. It keeps disconnecting after being idle for about a minute and doesn't wake up when pressing any keys on the keyboard. I checked to make sure that "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" was unchecked in device manager (Windows 7 and Windows 10) and this still happens.In addition the function switch behaves weirdly. If I switch the slider to the right the keyboard spams a datetime string over and over without any keys being pressed. Switching the slider to the left stops this.The shift+v combo also doesn't work which is just really random. I wanted to type the letter V but shift+v wouldn't even respond. Normal v works though.Finally this keyboard is not wired. I've long been a fan of Microsoft's Natural Ergonomic line (dating back to the Natural Ergonomic Elite- best keyboard ever) but this version just completely tarnishes the name. It was a terrible decision for Microsoft to not offer a wired version. I think every one of my issues with this keyboard would not exist if it was wired and not wireless.I would have gotten more value and entertainment out of flushing $80 down the toilet than dealing with this crap keyboard.
2,Smooth keyboard but the blue tooth keeps on cutting off. Only had this for a few weeks!
5,This keyboard cured the serious pain I was having in my arms/wrists.  I'm a software developer by trade and not being able to work from wrist/arm pain was costing me money.If you're a software developer: PLEASE take care of your wrists.  If those go out you're out of work.  $100 is NOTHING compared to the cost of being out for the day.
5,I absolutely love this keyboard for how compact it is and it's wifi range. I do not use the stand very much but like that it has the option. I am probably going to buy another one so I can keep one at home and one at the office. The mouse is great I did buy a little bean bag wrist support that helps me out. I use it with my mac it is totally compatible and I highly recommend it.
3,KEYBOARD - I've spent a few days getting used to the key layout after the Logitech keyboard I've used for 10 years :) I think it's fine.I've found a funny problem though -- while typing fast Shift key doesn't apply. For instance if I type "FORCE" fast half of time the last letter comes out lower-cased -- "FORCe". Try holding down Shift key and type "CE" really fast.. I get: "CECECECeCeCeCeCeCeCECeCeCeCeCECeCeCeCeCeCeCeCECeCeCeCeCE" -- although all of these should be upper-case. Boo!Over a couple weeks some keys developed a squeak.MOUSE is too much like a sphere.. too short and too tall for my hand to grab it comfortably.
5,This is the best wireless keyboard I've come across.  Had been waiting for the split keyboard to become wireless and I'm not disappointed.  I was surprised how much I like having the number pad separate from keyboard.  I can move it anywhere on my desk when I'm inputting numbers.  That's a real plus.  They mouse was a little big and took time to get used to but I have come to like it also.  All in all this is one of the best wireless options out there.
5,Awesome keyboard! This keyboard has solved my wrist problems and it only takes a couple of days to adjust to the design. I purchased this keyboard in 2017 and it still looks brand new. The wrist pad doesn't fade as long as you wipe it down with a Clorox wipe once a month.
5,I bought this for my wife in hopes that it would bring relief to her wrists. She has arthritis from old wrist injuries and she types a lot of work documents from the house every day. Before I bought her this combo she was dealing with near-constant wrist pain from using a laptop keyboard. This combo has puts her hands in a more neutral position and it has all but eliminated her typing related wrist pain.
5,I had a Microsoft wirelss ergo keyboard an mouse model 7000 for years both at home and at work.  They've been discontinued and unfortunately my home one has failed after all these years.  I got this to replace it and was pleasantly surprised.  It is equally comfortable and much sleeker design looks great on my desk.  Now I just have to figure out to get the boss to buy one for me for work.
3,Am I able to get a new plug in? Mine doesn’t work anymore which means I can’t use any of the devices anymore :/ everything else works great but the small plug in is all I need.
2,UPDATE May 4th 2016. Bought this on April 7 2014 and have really liked it. Today; however the keyboard stopped working. Yes I changed the batteries rebooted and moved the wireless to another slot. Nothing worked. Is it too much to ask to have something last for more than two years. Love the design but the manufacturing and components aren't what they need to be.April 2014 - The keyboard is exactly what I wanted and I love the number pad being separate.  It made doing taxes super easy.  The mouse broke within a week.  It (the mouse) is great ergonomically but the scroll feature - where you roll the wheel down to move down the screen - is not working.  I can hold the mouse wheel down and it will get me to the bottom sometimes too fast...  Would have been a five and frankly it's just too much hassle to return the whole thing just to get a mouse that works.
4,The mouse and keyboard are great and make my typing experience much better than what I previously had. However the piano black finish on the separate numerical keypad scratches like butter. Seriously all I did was touch the black and it scratched. I didn't wipe it with anything just touched it. So keep that in mind.
4,I have had several ergonomic keyboards before (even the legendary MS Natural Keyboard 4000 actually 4 of them). But this one is absolutely perfect. Key strokes feel good arrangement is comfortable and the detachable numeric pad is nice (I don't need it). It works really good with Mac (MacAir 2013).The only thing that I didn't like is the mouse. I should have bought the "enterprise" version without the mouse. The mouse is just awkward.
5,I've been using a Microsoft Natural keyboard for nearly 15 years at work.  It was a wonder when I got it and it's still going strong.  This Sculpt is even better.  Normally I don't like chicklet-style keys but these have a great feel.  The Sculpt mouse is terrific.  A regular mouse hurts the outside/back of the wrist over time and a vertical mouse can hurt the elbow over time.  The Sculpt mouse angles the wrist at around 45 degrees - perfectly natural.  I love this set already.
5,I liked this keyboard so much that I bought another for my work office.  It is comfortable and the mouse cradles your hand with ease.  I have some arthritis in my hands and they feel fine with this system.  Everyone that sees it wants to know where I got it.
3,I like the design of keyboard and mouse. But I really surprised when I saw the USB dongle (wireless receiver of the keyboard/mouse) as it was bigger than comparing with other brands. After using 2 months someone unplugged and took the USB dongle (some people say pendrive) from my computer probably thinking that was a flash drive. I contacted Microsoft support and they asked me to send the device back to them and they will send new one in return.
3,The unique size placement and spacing of the keys takes some getting used to.  And the reality of switching between this and a standard keyboard makes the muscle memory a challenge. Also the detached number pad can get in the way.  The mouse is nice.  Reliability-wise I had to return the first keyboard because several keys were sticking/missing punches after a couple of months.  That hasn't happened with the replacement fortunately and may have been a fluke.  And it's a little expensive.  So I like it but...  When the price comes down and I buy one for home I could become a fan.
4,THE BOARD WORKED VERY WELL RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX.ALL COMPONENTS DID AS WELL.CAPSLOCK BUTTON DOES NOT HAVE A LIGHT . NO WAY TO TELL IF IT IS ON OR NOT.I AM A LARGE MAN SO THE BOARD SEEMS A LITTLE SMALL IN WIDTH.I RATE IT A FIRM 4 FOR A SMALLER FRAMED PERSON A 4 1/2 AND IF THE LIGHT IS NOT NEEDED A STRONG 5 STAR RATING.
5,I love this keyboard. I did have to get used to my muscle memory for the keypad but a small difference for a better design. Excellent manufacturing good price small and quiet. The mouse fits perfectly as well.
5,Replaced a Microsoft Natural 4000. Absolutely love the key style. Similar to current laptop chicklet style. Am able to type very quickly and accurately. Also like the fact that it takes much less space than the 4000. I also like the mouse. Feels good in the hand works smoothly. Don't have much use for the Windows button. The back button is placed a little awkwardly for easy acces. Don't use either of them much. Better placement would have made them more useful. Overall very happy with this keyboard and mouse set.
5,This is a very great product.
4,Awesome desktop set  the keyboard takes up a small footprint now that there is a detached number keypad.  Very ergonomic and comfortable.  The riser under the keyboard does not raise as high as the natural keyboard that came before this one.The mouse would be great if it was bigger in size and the back button is harder to push than on other mouses.  But all in all a good set.
4,Product is visually stunning - however - the ergonomic layout takes time to adjust to. 4 weeks in and I am still at reduced productivity.I love the mouse it fits right in the palm of your hand.I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a versatile keyboard/mouse solution at an affordable price.
5,The mouse is just fantastic! The shape supports my hand so well that I was reluctant to switch to other products. The keyboard did require you some time to adopt to it but I like it a lot. If the whole set supports Bluetooth then it'll be the best.
1,Was having some rough wrist pain from typing all day and use to have a keyboard like this during work so decided to purchase it.  It is very comfortable and my wrist pain went away.However it gets hit with extreme lag spikes periodically making typing impossible.  Duplicate keys missed keys etc. The receiver is plugged into a USB port as my pixelbook does not have usb ports.  I've replaced the batteries in the mouse and keyboard as well.However I've used other wireless keyboards and have never had this problem.As much as i love the comfort i'm unfortunately going to be returning the product as its simply unusable.
5,I need an ergo set because I have carpal tunnel.  I went through 4 keyboard / mouse combos that would quit working after a week or so because they would not compat with Microsoft 10.  This is the only one I found that is still working after 3 months.
4,Very good keyboard and mouse.  PC and mac compatible.  Escape key and function buttons a little small.  "Back" button on mouse usable but a little flush with the surface.  Overall don't hesitate to get this one if you're looking for an ergonomic setup.
5,I love the mouse no more nerve pain in my hand or arm after only 2 days of use. I dont like the number key pad being seperate. The keyboard is awesome and causes no hand cramping. Everyone who uses a computer daily should have appropriate ergonomically correct hand gear and this is it.
1,The keyboard itself is designed OK although the keys are a little stiff for my taste.The mouse is a bit of a blob personally I don't find it very ergonomic.The big problem is the wireless dongle which is non-replaceable (unlike Logitech) and the horrendous customer service when things break down.The dongle stopped working on me so I'm left with a dead keyboard an mouse. I contacted customer support. As expected it's somewhere in India or similar with very bad English. After sending them everything they wanted the claim they didn't receive the proof of purchase so I sent it again and again and again. After four times I call them they didn't get any of the emails nor any of the attachments and they give me another email to use and wait another two days to see if it arrived (which of course just bounced ...)And after wasting two weeks with them (and buying another keyboard in the meantime since I have to work only Logitech from now on) they want me to send the keyboard back to them at my expense wait until it arrives and only then send the replacement so it's going to be another several weeks until something hopefully happens.
5,Have one in my office and my home.  So comfortable to use for long periods of time.  It does take some time to get use to if your not proficient at proper typing because of the split in the keyboard but after awhile you really get the hand of it and my hands and wrists haven't hurt since using it.  Microsoft really did a great job on this keyboard coming from someone who is on a computer for 10-12 hours a day programming
5,HUGE HUGE Fan of this product. AS a matter of fact I type this review from the sculpt keyboard.I use this on my office PC as well as for my Surface pro4.Best thing to ever happen to my wrists! The separated 10 key is a dream too. I admit it took me a minute to like the mouse!
4,I purchased this mouse and keyboard about one year ago.  The plastic is hard to keep fingerprints off of and easily scratches.  The rubber on the side of the mouse gets worn by placing my ring-finger there.  It works well just doesn't look that great after one year of use.
4,Excellent keyboard. It feels solid and very well build with great feedback on the keys. My only reason for not giving it a full 5 starts is the padding sometimes digs into my palm / wrist depending on my typing position. While most of the time it is very comfortable there are times where the edge of that padding starts to get uncomfortable.Other than that this is easily the best keyboard I've used.
5,By far my favorite keyboard. I love short key stroke on keyboards and this is perfect. I don't have to push down on the keys all that hard. I found my fingers don't get tired as quickly because the keys are so light. I also gained a little bit of typing speed. I enjoy the split angle on my hands. The mouse is also comfortable because i have large hands and the mouse fills my hands nicely.
5,I had the logitech ergonomic keyboard so I needed to relearn the positions of some keys. I have an ergonomic mouse that I was having a little trouble getting used to. The ergonomic mouse that came with this keyboard was really easy to use The separate nmber keypad is taking a little while to get accustom to.I really like the fact the keys are easy touch low profile.
5,Use for work and absolutely love the feel.  At first getting used to the proper way was tough but now using a normal flat keyboard is actually awkward. Battery life is great and haven’t had to replace the battery since purchasing.
5,This is the coolest ergonomic keyboard I've ever used.  I love the magnets for easy attachment.  Very comfortable and easy to get used to.  I recently obtained a Mac and have always used PCs with ergonomic keyboards.  This keyboard is pricier than I'm used to but I got it at half the price for a brand new keyboard with used packaging.
5,I type large narrative reports often fifty to 150 pages in length.  After having some wrist problems I did some research and bought this keyboard.  For the first few days I was a little lost in terms of touch-typing.  After that short period I was typing like I learned how on this keyboard and my wrists don't bother me any longer.  I feel the design of this keyboard is as good as it gets in terms of ease of typing and comfort.
1,While I was getting accustomed to the keyboard layout - delete key was weirdly placed and curvature was different from previous ergonomic keyboards - I dropped my computer and broke the dongal. After a nightmare of trying to get to someone at Microsoft I finally found a path to speak with a customer service rep who told me that my $120 keyboard and mouse were now useless because the dongals are uniquely coded and paired with keyboard and therefore irreplacable and my best bet was to buy another Sculpt. I will never buy another Microsoft piece of hardware. Buyer beware and protect your dongal!.
4,Great keyboard shape good keys for typing. I like the detached number pad -- I never use it and so I don't have to reach far for the mouse. The mouse has just the right angle. (I tried a vertical mouse before and found that unusable.) I wish it was wired or used Bluetooth rather than a custom dongle but it worked out of the box on my Linux desktop (Ubuntu 12.04).
5,Hands feel less tired after using the keyboard. Noticed I type faster as well. Would order same product again.
4,Took me a while to get used to this format from my older 7000 model but MAN IS THIS KEYBOARD QUIET!  Mouse I am still trying to get used to.  Not sure why the mouse doesn't have a "Forward" button - hence I took 1 star off.
5,I just now opened the box plugged it in and started typing....and I DO NOT WANT TO STOP! This keyboard is life changing. Buy it now and throw away whatever other piece of junk you are currently using. Trust me you'll be happy you did.Now I must go and write the great American novel...using my brand new keyboard.
5,First time with the Microsoft keyboard and it was very easy to adjust to and its' really comfy.  The part closest to the typer tilts up allowing you to rest your wrists on the keyboard and type effortlessly and correctly.  I didn't know about the separate numerical keyboard but I find that very useful also.  Great buy.
3,Keyboard and mouse lag behind
5,Bought this keyboard/mouse combo for my new all-in-one PC. I wanted something ergo (an ergo keyboard didn't come with my PC) and also wanted some minimal. I LOVE it. Super comfortable and SUPER quiet - you just hear tiny clicks versus much louder keyboards I've used. I love the one for home so I bought a SECOND for the office. I have a ton of jealous co-workers. Also if you're worried the little numeric pad has good grips on the bottom so it doesn't slip away like I thought it would. Great purchase!
4,Good keyboard super ergonomic but the keys are too flat and thin. The travel distance when the finger hits the keys is too short which puts a lot of stress on the fingers. Pretty good otherwise specially since there is nothing else like it.
5,Could barely lift my arm to do my job.  I still have trouble but I cannot work without using the sculpt keyboard.  The mouse is not as comfortable as I would like.  Too tall and round.  But it has been very helpful over the traditional styles.  The USB works w mouse and number from several positions.
5,I am really happy with this purchase. Fully compatible with a mac laptop. Feels comfortable on the keys and hands position. No lags on the connectivity with the laptop. It is not too quiet (not advised if you want a really quiet/silent keyboard). Also it doesn't have any back light but it is okay for me.
5,Love this key board and the separate numbers/calculator keyboard. It's much quieter than other Ergonomic keyboards. Bought one for home will be buying one for work. The only one supplied by the company is annoyingly loud when you type. Highly recommend it. Easy to get used to and is very intuitive for key location.
3,I bought this package to use at work. I love the keyboard! So comfortable and easy to use. However my mouse arrived broken.I'd like to receive a replacement mouse since I paid for it but don't want to have to return the keyboard as well as it came as a bundle.
1,This is the 5th Microsoft Sculpt keyboard I've been through in the last 2 years (Not all through Amazon). Out of the box it is perfect.  The keys are soft to the touch responsive and quiet.  The ergonomics are amazing.  The mouse is a little large for my small hand but comfortable enough that once I got used to it I didn't want to use another mouse.  Overall this is a dream setup.  I haven't found another ergonomic keyboard that compares.  But as with everything too good to be true this dream keyboard dies.  No battery issues no abuse issues... It.  Just.  Dies.  Sometimes they make it 3 months sometimes 6 months...this last purchase I made died in just over 1 month...long enough to outlast the return window.  I keep buying them because I keep thinking that Microsoft has maybe fixed the problem.  Maybe they've read the reviews and learned their lesson.  But after just trashing my 5th Microsoft Sculpt keyboard at $99 a pop...it's time for me to learn my lesson.0 stars would be given if I could.
4,The system is very good and  what I wanted. The only problem I had was that the numeric keyboard did not work. It seems that the tab that stopped the battery from connecting was missing and the battery was dead. I had to pay $6 to get a new one. It works fine now but the extra time and cost made it less favorable.
5,Ergonomically it’s great for carpal tunnel
3,I really like the shape and design of the keyboard.  If I had bought it without the mouse I would have given this keyboard a 5 star rating.  It's the mouse that drags this product down.  Why - Because the darn cover for the batteries comes off with EVERY lift of the mouse.  No matter how many times you snap it back on it pops right back off when you set it down.  HATE the mouse.  Love the Keyboard.
5,Love this keyboard the ergonomic design is the best yet. I love that they keys don't make a lot of noise when I'm typing.  I also like that they aren't "squishy" feeling.  The mouse is also great - it took a little bit of use to feel natural but now I can't stand the standard mouse!  I love that this is wireless - I was up and running with it in less than two minutes.
5,Making the number pad a separate item is why I initially purchased this keyboard.  I have owned many variations of the MS Natural Keyboard(s) and this is my favorite version by far.  My only complaints would be the position of the insert button or the lack of drivers for Mac OSX.  Other than that if you're a fan of MS Ego keyboards this is a great product.  Some reviewers have complained about the magnetic battery holders but so far I have not had any issues with this but it is something to be aware of.
3,A year after purchasing the right shift key stopped working. Others have too but the right shift key is the most important. Very inconvenient.
5,I love this keyboard setup.  I've used Microsoft split keyboards for years and this is my favorite.  It is very comfortable and easy to type on.  It is also MUCH quieter than the Microsoft Natural Keyboards.  This keyboard doesn't bother people on the other end of the phone like my Microsoft Natural Keyboard did.I also love that the 10Key Pad is separate so I can put it aside unless I need it.  Great way to clear up desk space!
5,One of the most comfortable keyboards I've ever used. It's a natural hand position. The sculpt mouse while odd to look at creates an extremely natural feeling the moment I touched it. I wish it had a few more buttons on the keyboard maybe dedicated for sound and I wish the settings were not switched with a mechanical toggle. The 10-key detached "calculator" is a space saver as keyboard tray is limited in size. The keyboard is light and the buttons are awesome to the touch. I'm literally enjoying typing this!
5,Taking a little getting used to but very comfortable so far.  I love the flexibility of having the number keyboard separate!  I have small hands and was skeptical about the mouse but that too is very comfortable.  The spacebar makes a louder click noise but other than that I absolutely am satisfied with my purchase.
4,Works well but if you have an Apple computer you will need to adjust some buttons on the back end because they don't work automatically with an Apple product. Given Apple doesn't make ergonomic keyboards you'll have to find a Microsoft or other company keyboard anyway.
3,I like the concept but it hasn't been all that fantastic.  The number keypad is not very responsive; neither is the space bar on the keyboard so I have to strike them much harder than I normally would.  With the amount of typing I do (I use it for work) it gets tiring.  And annoying. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the devices but it made no difference.
4,This is a high quality keyboard with a very good layout.  For me the keys were too easy to activate and I found myself making a lot of errors.  The mouse is only for right hand use and I mouse with my left hand (leaving my right one free to use the number keypad).  I ended up giving it to a friend who likes it very much.
4,don't like that the 10 key doesn't have an equal sign and it's not attached. On my second set 1st set died after a year battery life is good though. But very comfortable for daily work and I love the shape of the mouse.
2,After owning this for a while I have a few issues that force me not to recommend this product.  First is that the keypad seems to have a weak transmitter.  Even with the receiver a few inches away and without an obstruction it does not reliably send key presses.  Why the chose to separate the 10-key I can't really say.  Other major issues are that using the function keys and the media keys requires you to flip a tiny toggle that isn't easy to change.  It is poor design choice and they ought to have made them separate keys and did away with the toggle all-together.  I also don't like the cramped positioning of the home end page and arrow keys.That said for most typing it is comfortable and I am still using it but I really was hoping for more.
1,This is actually the second of the Microsoft Sculpt keyboards that I purchased. The first had issues with keys on the keyboard itself. Apparently too much use (less than a month as it was still within the Amazon return window) was too much for for the space key. The mechanism that held the key in place could no longer hold the key properly and it was left loose and always almost ready to fall off. I thought that was just a one time thing so I got a replacement keyboard. With the second keyboard the USB receiver attachment literally broke off in my laptop's USB port is stuck in there and no longer communicates with the mouse or keyboard.These are two different keyboards that only had light office use on them for less than a month to a little over a month with the second keyboard. I'm past my return deadline now so I'm stuck (quite literally as the attachment is stuck in my laptop) with this broken piece of garbage and out $100. I'm sure there are better products out there that at the very least last more than a month.
5,I was skeptical at first after reading some of the reviews but I had none of the problems some people were complaining about. This keyboard is working perfectly for me and I've had it for several months now.  It's possible Microsoft has improved it since some of the other reviews were posted.  I would definitely purchase this again if I needed another one.  They keys are very quiet because they are slim profile soft touch keys compared to typical keyboards.
5,I've been using this combo for a couple of months now.  This is better than most ergonomic keyboards and by far one of the nicest mice I've used in an office setting.  I especially like the fact that I can move the keypad to a different location when not in use.
5,Best Ergo Keyboard and Mouse.  Love the touch keys on the keyboard and I have to honestly say my wrist stopped hurting so much after using the mouse for about a week or so.  I am on my computer all day for work...I do a lot of typing and this is by far the best ergo keyboard set I've had thus far!  Thank you.
4,I've had this before. It only lasted 3 years before the battery charge was draining my batteries in 24 hours. Also some keys started to no register. But it's comfortable and easy to type with so I ordered a new one.
5,I purchased this 4 years ago and was thinking of getting another.  I noticed the reviews were spotty.  Mine has worked flawlessly for the 4 years I have had it.  I have on occasion moved it to other computer or unplugged it and it works fine.  I just love it.
2,I get that is supposed to be "ergonomic" and was trying to be kind to my hands... but I absolutely hated it. I didn't find it relieved any pressure from my hands it actually was draining to try to adapt to such a different shape the space in between letters made me go to the wrong key constantly. I suppose one could get used to it after some time. The mouse on the other hand absolutely unusable for me I have relatively small hands and the mouse is about the size of a larger baseball. I had to hold up my hole arm to use it since it's so far off the table and the size made it very hard to do fine movements like picture editing and such. I don't recommend this.
1,Terrible product that does not work and terrible customer service. Spent two hours with them on the phone and did not help!!!!
4,Really great for Emacs on Linux!Only things on the downside:1. Too hard to find arrow buttons without looking (they feel too much like all the other buttons)2. Numeric keyboard doesn't seem the same build quality as the main keyboard
5,This is the best keyboard I have ever had. The ergonomics are just right (for me anyway) and the keys have a great feel to them. The mouse is solid but I dont care for the placement of the back button on it. It's not the easiest to press. Don't let that take away from the keyboard though if you don't care for the mouse just buy the keyboard by itself and get a different mouse.
4,The key board and 10 key are separated.  The key board is a bit tighter than the old board.  Love the mouse.
5,I have used many ergonomic keyboards since 1999 and this is one of the best!  It is lightweight has the lift on the wrist side of the keyboard and the most delicate touch.  I love this keyboard so much that I got the boss to buy one for my work computer.
4,I've been having wrist problems lately. This keyboard is saving me a lot of wear and tear on the wrists forearms elbows and shoulders. Wrist pain has all but disappeared. The mouse is weird and takes some getting used to but works fine. I have had no problems with connectivity - the mouse is a good 4 feet from the dongle and works fine.
5,I like that I am not connected to my computer. Gone are the days of being limited by my laptop or my PC's keyboard chord.  Yeah!
4,Keyboard is fine. Mouse is starting to act up. Bottom plate no longer stays on (but the mouse still works). Top wheel sometimes does not work (probably needs a cleaning).
2,From an ergonomic standpoint is pretty good but I have bought two sets in 1 1/2 years because the USB gadget stops working as simple as that. Then you have to trash a keyboard and a mouse to waste plastic and planet resources and make Microsoft ever richer...bad bad!
4,Great product I bought this about a month ago and I been using both at work and home that learning curveyou hear about in reviews is real takes about a week to get used to the B for me. Also for the lefties out there who are worried about the strictly right handed mouse I'm a Lefty and I'm doing just fine. No issue
4,I love this keyboard!  Takes a little time to get used to but very comfortable when you do. The external calculator is wonderful and way more useful than I originally imagined. The mouse is not that great too big. I'd like a mobile case.
4,This has certainly helped me ease me wrist aches while working as I work as a software engineer. The placement of the homeend and related keys are non-optimal and I wish that would change. I also wish the mouse was a little longer.But overall a good product.
5,I've long been a fan of mechanical keyboards so I was a little hesitant to get this one; but it's very tactile the gel padding is absolutely the most comfortable I've used and the keyboard is quite stunning.  Having the wireless 10-key is a nice touch -- put it out of the way when you don't need it grab it when you do.  The mouse is very responsive and comfortable.  I'll always be a sucker for a good trackball but this blue laser mouse does just fine in my work environment.
4,This isn't exactly what I thought I was buying. All the numbers are at the top of the keyboard!!! I however am training myself to the changes. I love the fact that the keys are gentle to my fingers touch. Easier on my joints. Ergonomically better for my wrists.
5,Absolutely love it.  The key pad is there if I want it.  The battery covers are magnetized.  The mouse is AMAZING!!  Great design.  It cups your hand instead of forcing you to flatten your hand out and strain joints and muscles.  The key board is arched and split very well.  It is thin and light weight and travels well.  If you are a Mac user the "Windows" key acts like a "CTRL" key for cutting pasting etc.
2,I love this ergonomic keyboard - it's very comfortable and has saved my wrists. However there's a major design flaw - if the USB dongle breaks you can toss the keyboard and mouse in the garbage. That's a lot of plastic! Why can't microsoft replace the dongle? I'm assuming giving each keyboard a serial number so that a new receiver could be sent wouldn't be difficult in this day and age. So my five star rating is a two since my receiver broke (it's a bit flimsy) and since I worry about our plastic problem I feel terrible about throwing away a perfectly good keyboard and mouse and I question the ethics of a company that isn't thinking of our planet.
5,Amazing keyboard. I had the first curved microsoft keyboard and thought to try this one. I got used to it very fast. It has a smooth feeling on the keys while the wrist position matched my style of typing. However it is a bit awkward when you have to "travel" to reach the numpad and the mouse. Next version should have a mouse tip/pad it seems that there is enough space in between.
3,I've used ergonomic keyboards for decades now.  Maybe I've just gotten lazy with my Microsoft Split keyboard or something - but I tried for 5 months to adjust to the angle of typing on this keyboard -  muchless the arch it's forcing my hand into --- and -- well - I just couldn't.Don't buy it because it's cool lookingDon't buy it because you think it will helpThe price is right..Battery life is pretty goodThere does seem to be a bit of a lag tho when typing.
4,Excellent keyboard. I like the angle of rest for my wrists while typing. Price could be better but not going to rate it low for that. I really like the mouse. I had used the magic pad and gestures for a long time but recently returned to enterprise IT and struggled to find a HID pointing device that I liked. This fit the bill nicely.
5,I've been using ergo kb's for a long time and this is my first wireless. I love the low profile and the keys are short throw and more sensitive than the wired model. The mouse is ok feels like a baseball under your hand. I'd love to see MS bring back the trackball they used to make dropping it was just dumb.
3,One star is lost because the usb receiver protrudes too far out and is easily damaged. Do NOT let this happen!!! These devices are uniquely paired so the usb receiver is not replaceable if damaged or lost - a HUGE hassle. You will have to mail the keyboard and mouse to Microsoft (at your own expense) and wait for a replacement to be mailed. Otherwise it's a comfortable pair.
5,Love this keyboard / mouse setup. I have 2 setups at home and recommended several people at the office to get them too.I type for 4-8 hours a day easy. This is easy and comfortable to use. I've been using it for years and have no discomfort in my fingers.
4,For those smaller in stature this keyboard is a great option.  You keep all of the features and have more flexibility.
4,I would have given it five star if the main keyboard was a bit shorter and a bit more attention had been given to the 10-key pad.  It doesn't look like they belong together as a set.  Microsoft is getting sloppier and more greedy every day.  If you gonna charge 4 5 times more than other brands don't cheap out us consumers.
5,Keyboard build quality is rock solid.  I was worried that the chicklet style keys wouldn't agree with me.  They actually have a good touch to them.  Very different from previous versions of MS Ergonomic keyboards.  But once you get used to the feel they type very nicely.The only downside is the right hand layout of the arrow keys insert pageup.  They are quite different from previous keyboards and are taking some time to get used to.
5,I love this keyboard set and have had no trouble with it. I wasn't sure if I would like the unattached number pad but it is nice to be able to move it out of the way when I'm not using it. I have been using thsi for like 3 months and not had to change batteries yet. One downside is it is nearly impossible to keep wrist pad clean. It gets whitish where my wrists sets. Overall I love this keyboard for working all day as I sit a computer all day.
4,Amazing design... perfect for my long work days.  Also purchased one for home use.  Would have given 5 stars but on each set the battery for the numerical keypad only lasted a week.  Had to go out and purchase new batteries.
5,Love everything about these.  I have a hard time using other keyboards now ... although it took me a week or so to get used to this one.  Love the more rounded mouse ... fits my hand perfectly.
5,Very classy product.  Just retired my old Microsoft Ergonomic keyboard.  The coolest feature is the detached number keypad.  The keypad is a calculator killer since it has a shortcut to launch the calculator and has a clear button etc just like a calculator does.The keys feel good and the placement of all the keys is just right.  I've not had any trouble switching over to the new one.
3,So I'm not in love with this thing... The numbers on the pad do NOT work... while the dash asterisk + and - do work.  No fricking idea why.  Also the number pad battery case is screwed on while the other battery cases are magnetic?  wtf were you thinking?  oh and guess what... tech support line doesn't even have an option for Hardware or keyboards etc... and the wait time is 90 minutes!  PLEASE APPLE... Come out with an ergonomic desktop already!!!!!
5,I love this thing. It's smaller than the previous natural wireless keyboard and it has smaller laptop-style keys that are quieter and easier to press. The double space bar doesn't jam like on the previous model's single unit space bar. The number keypad is so convenient too since you can store it somewhere when it's not being used and it doesn't take up precious desk space. However I will say that the mouse while comfortable just doesn't compare to the previous natural wireless mouse. Overall a great product though.
5,I have this keyboard/mouse at work and in my home office. It's just the best.It seems the mouse is a little more hit or miss. I really like it. However several of my co-workers have this same keyboard but do not like the mouse. So if you are fussy about your computer mouse you may want to purchase the keyboard without it.
5,I'm surprised by how much I love this keyboard. My hands were going numb/cold using my old keyboard. This new one completely solved the problem. Yes it does take some getting used to - I have to look more carefully to make sure I put my fingers down in the right spot before typing. But I quickly got used to it.
5,I love ergonomic keyboards and this was better than expected.  Kudos to the engineers for a well built product.  It looks a little flimsy but this thing has weight to it.  Even the piece that lifts the front for better ergo is good.  And having the removable parts held with magnets is a very nice touch.  Batteries last a very long time.NOTE: I have had this almost a year and still working perfect.
1,This item came to me refurbished without the USB receiver. The receiver is the plug in that causes everything to work. If you are selling refurbished the least you can do is ensure that everything is included in the box including the peice that makes it all work.
4,Bought this two weeks back. Happy with the results from both keyboard and mouse so far. Keyboard is sturdy. But provides the same confort as model 4000.Had a tough time with 3M Ergo mouse earlier. Started getting pain from my thumb. This mouse seems to work good so far. All the shortcut keys in the mouse are useless. Windows start short key is hard to press.
1,The keyboard is awesome and quite honestly very comfortable to use.  Although I personally found it very comfortable to type with the overall design of the receiver (dongle) is beyond comprehension.  The size of the dongle is for the most part a stain on your USB port that is yelling "look at me" because it is just asking to get hit by something and break [which is what happened].  Once the dongle breaks the entire unit is useless since the keyboard/mouse/number pad are uniquely linked and registered to that specific dongle.  I called Microsoft and they basically said to throw away the keyboard and buy another one.  I would not buy this again and did not.  I shopped around and eventually purchased the Logitech K350 Wave Design keyboard which is not as comfy as the Microsoft one but good enough.  Furthermore you will never have issues with the dongle since it tucks away in one of your USB ports and should it break Logitech uses a universal dongle system.
1,I love -- and have used -- the Sculpt keyboard for years (whenever it had its debut)...but this time the new keyboard would not respond to any input.  The mouse was fine.How should I handle this issue?  I'm using my "old" Sculpt keyboard and mouse combination while I ponder this situation.Lisa M
5,I have had this set for 4 years now. This is an update. It is still going strong and I am about to purchase a second mouth. No more wrist pain. No more pain at all. BEST MOUSE AND KEYBOARD EVER MADE. I use it daily for work and 0 issues and it has been 4 years. I was so glad to see they still make it.
4,I really like this keyboard mostly just because it's wireless.  It's also very quiet as far as typing goes.  The 10 key pad kind of sucks though.  I can't type the numbers very fast on it because it always misses numbers.  And it' not the battery either.
5,The keyboard and mouse is top of the line. I ordered one for Win8 and then after testing it at my home I went ahead and ordered another one for my iMac at the office. Great ergonomics nice quality and both keyboard and mouse are very comfortable. The keyboard should be rated 4.5 due to lack of backlit keys but as it stands it is very good product and having no ability to rate the set 4.5 it is more of a 5 star product than 4. You can't go wrong with this set.
3,I really do like this set... till the mouse back button stuck and I cannot replace it because the newer version isn't compatible with the single dongle.  I would have to use two dongles or purchase a new set.  Oh well back to the drawing board.
1,I hate to write this review with such a poor rating but after some usage the USB Dongle that is REQUIRED separated from the USB jacket and inner chip and the keyboard and mouse stopped working.After a 30 minute chat with Microsoft and higher levels of support they told me its not possible to replace what is likely a $1 USB dongle for a $100+ set.  Further they can't file a warranty claim because physical damage isnt covered.  Thats absurd.  They didn't offer to replace it offer a discount or any viable solution to resolve the issue.  They just said "sorry".What a shameful and wasteful product this is.
5,If you're a touch typist the keyboard has an absolutely wonderful tactile feel to it. The only minor item I ran into is that the enter key is just a hair farther way than I am used to on a traditional keyboard. Took about four hours to adjust.This will take a few hours to get used to but once you do it just feels lovely on the fingers.
5,I can't live without this thing. I had aches in my fingers and wrists before trying it out and all of that immediately went away. I can't recommend it enough for your work health. I bought one for my friend complaining of the same aches and it worked for her too. Inexpensive reliable and incredible for my joints. I won't work on anything else.
3,Pro: Great key pad and mouse ergonomic layout.  Immediate relief to wrist strain.  Uses little battery power.Home: I appreciate short key travel but this is a bit too shallow.  Porous palm-rest collects dust which is hard to wipe off.  Mouse clicks make mouse sound "hollow plasticky" (aka feels cheap); is this the best desktop MS can make?  See how Apple product feels!
1,Ergonomically this keyboard is superb but the mouse is only so-so.  I have pretty bad carpal tunnel syndrome and I haven't had any symptoms while typing ever since I got it.  HOWEVER  it's been only ten months and the 1 and 2 keys have to be pressed repeatedly before they will work and the ! and @ symbols DON'T WORK AT ALL.  This keyboard isn't cheap - I expect a LOT more than 11 months out of something that costs this much.  And if the issue is with the dongle well then I am S.O.L. since Microsoft doesn't make keyboards that can take a replacement dongle.  Never again will I purchase a Microsoft keyboard or mouse.  NEVER AGAIN.UPDATE:  The 1 2 ! @ Q and Tab keys now DON'T WORK AT ALL.  Ridiculous.  This keyboard is expensive so the fact that I have lost use of almost the entire top left corner of it is unacceptable.  I wish I could return this thing!!!!
4,Great product except that about a month after purchase a few keys on the number pad have completely stopped working... completely defeats the purpose.
5,I love this product it took awhile to get use to but then muscle memory kicked in. Now i feels my accuracy has improved.
2,Well I really like the ergonomic aspect of this keyboard - bar none the best keyboard I've used.  However I think there is some quality issues with this keyboard.My first keyboard was not leveled - it would rock back and forth when I press the "Tab" key.  I returned to Amazon and got a replacement.  My replacement keyboard was leveled but it would lose RF connection every 2 or 3 days.  I would use the keyboard then all of sudden both keyboard and mouse would not work.  I have to plug/unplug USB dongle multiple times and/or toggle the ON/OFF switch.  I'm sending this one back to Amazon as well.  I hope my third replacement will be perfect.I will update this review accordingly.
5,This is a great combo. I am typing now with the keyboard and love it. It takes some getting used to but it would now be hard to go back to my old flat keyboard. The number key is very handy to have detached from the main keyboard.I have not really given the mouse a chance. It looks cool.All and all the keyboard and keypad is worth the price. I type a lot with my job and appreciate the quality of the keys and shape of the board.
5,This set is so comfortable. I love the way the keyboard feels overall and the touch of the key presses. If you haven't used a set like this it will likely take a bit of getting used to but if you have had any wrist pain I highly recommend. They are really very comfortable once you are used to them and regular keyboards and mice will feel strange and uncomfortable.
5,This is a fabulous pair of devices.  I've used ergonomic keyboard/mouse combinations most of my career and given the amount of typing I do I am convinced that my use of these accessories definitely protected me from developing carpal tunnel syndrome.  Microsoft really gets it right here.
4,The keyboard has an excellent balance between being stylish and functional. The reliability unfortunately is not so excellent. The <+=> key got stuck five weeks after the purchase. Calling to the Microsoft’s customer service was a waste of my time whereas poking under the key with a reshaped staple did the trick. The key is working again and I am happy with the purchase... kind of...
1,I have had this for a bit over a year.  I love the keyboard and the mouse grew on me.  But the mouse began to double click on a single click.  I twice tried to get in contact with Microsoft support because it was still under warranty.  The first time I gave up after a couple hours of being on hold and getting transferred from person to person.  The second time the same thing.  I have been on the phone trying to find someone that will honor the warranty but no one will.  Constantly being put on hold transferred no help at all.  This is the last Microsoft hardware I will ever buy.Another thing about this desktop set that is terrible is the dongle is paired to only the keyboard number pad and mouse it came with.  If one breaks you need a whole new set.  There is no way to pair a new component with the old dongle.
5,There are just not enough text spaces to explain how much I love this combo. I work a desk 7/8 hours a day and have had carpel and cubital tunnel issues and none with this set.
4,Was perfect for the person I purchased this for however the bottom piece that attaches to make the keyboark have more of an angle was lost and can't seem to find anywhere to purchase just that one piece.  I would be nice to have the option to buy separate parts.
5,So far so good.  Keyboard takes a little getting used to from the traditional keyboard but overall the performance and material quality is great.  I wish you could customize the Mouse keys but I have yet to find out how.
5,This is the best wireless keyboard and mouse I’ve had. The battery life is great and connection distance is outstanding. The ergonomic keyboard is very comfortable. I love the design. It’s very sturdy and top of the line construction. Well worth the money.
5,I like that this keyboard has a separate number pad. There is only one USB for all three parts and the USB stores inside of the mouse which is really convenient. It's definitely weird getting used to the mouse and I'm still not sure if I'm always using it properly but overall I really like this set and think it's worth the cost. Since it's so lightweight I throw it in my laptop bag and take it with me (although it is admittedly a little awkward since the keyboard curves).
4,Looks great and works really well. I just wish there was a way to attach the keypad to the main keyboard. My hand naturally drifts over to where it "should" be on a one-piece kb but the keypad often drifts a bit and I hit the wrong keys if I'm not looking.
5,This mouse is amazing! It feels like my hand is getting a hug. Super supportive and much more comfortable. The keyboard is also great. I wish it was a little quieter but oh well. The top row of keys (Esc F1 F2 etc) are actual buttons instead of keys which is a little weird but I'm not too bothered by it.
5,First thing you'll notice in pulling out the Microsoft Scupt Ergonomic Desktop Keyboard and Mouse combo is the quality. The keys are nice and stiff (in a good way) and the mouse is extremely responsive.I utilize this as part of a docking station for my Microsoft Surface Pro 3. The keyboard stays clean and has a great raiser included in the package for those who want to keep their wrists elevated in line with the keyboard.
4,My only complaint is that I would like the number pad to be attached to the keyboard.  It shifts easily and is out of position.I keep hitting wrong keys as it is never aligned exactly as if it was attached.
5,if you are coming from Microsoft Natural Ergonomics 4000 you will be delighted. It is still the split keyboard you love with a laptop-like keys and a brilliant design. It is hard to describe how much smaller this thing is in comparison to the 4000 and how good it looks.The mouse is great too. It has dedicated Win/back buttons and is a joy to use. If I were not a die-hard fan of Logitech Trackball I would ditch all other pointing devices for it.
2,There are many reviews that cheer this keyboard as the great thing since sliced bread and a worthy successor to the Natural 4000 keyboard. In my mind nothing could be farther than the truth. Here is why... a) I find the keys as sticky so typing a address of 108 Beacon Road can come out as 08 eacon oad b) there are no indicator lights for cAPS lOCK so unless are someone who watches the screen while typing you could find a substantial error in your writing c.) there is no zoom slide for applications like Excel or Chrome Browser The only positive change is the single PrtScn key.  In short its function follows it's style. If you want a workhorse get the 4000 keyboard I am sending this back.
4,Good keyboard and mouse. Quality could be better on keyboard resting pad. It attracts lint and dirt.
5,Ordered this kit because of how much I use the keyboard. Ergonomics was important and Microsoft's latest offering is wonderful. I read a few reviews of people talking about the palm rest wearing out because of its soft padded materials. I haven't seen this happen maybe if you use the tilt piece that would put more pressure on the palms of your hands.The keys have nice feedback and I like the fact that there is a toggle switch for the function keys.
1,I use to use the 4000 but wanted a quieter keyboard especially the space bar.  This keyboard is definitely quieter than the 4000.  On the positive it also takes up much less desktop space especially when you get rid of the numeric pad.  It sits well on my hands too.  However on the negative side the mouse is pathetic (use anything else but this) and the placement of some of the keys is very different from the 4000 - takes a long time to get use to it.After further use it hit me ... this really is like a laptop keyboard ... it is not your traditional keyboard.  The user experience has been frustrating.  I am a speed typer and am spending more time correcting my typos especially if I have to use any non-alphabetic key.This product is not recommended.  Microsoft needs to concentrate on perfecting their 4000 ... that is an incredible keyboard but is too loud.  Fix that and they will have the real winner.  Sometimes I wonder what those folks in Seattle are thinking ... they are disconnected from the typical users.
2,I bought this keyboard for use in a retail operation for printing invoices not a heavy or power use situation.  I loved the way the keyboard worked and the separate keypad was a wonderful thing. The keys were very easy to press and all was good. Within 4 months the keys started to stick on both the keyboard and the keypad to the point we were unable to enter phone numbers without missing at least one digit and it was not consistent as to which key was the problem.  There do not seem to be any good ergonomic replacements out there so I have had to go to an old model and cobble up a keyboard and mouse combination.  I have had good luck with the old model and I am very frustrated with the short life of this product.
3,It is a nice looking  keyboard but did not work for me.
1,Keyboard just stopped working.  The mouse and number pad were fine.  After hours on unhelpful Microsoft support sites I decided to call Microsoft.  An automated voice informed me that "for my convenience" all support is done online now and directed me back to the unhelpful Microsoft support site.  I tried changing batteries uninstall/reinstall and downloading drivers.  Nothing.  Last time I buy hardware from Microsoft.
4,keyboard is great really has helped with Carpel Tunnel.  I am not a fan of the mouse buttons they can be difficult to press sometimes.
2,While this did help a great deal with my left hand pain towards the end of a day of typing it has too many other bad problems.Even with all drivers installed and updated there is sporadic periods of high lag and latency. The F1-F12 keys are incredibly small and flimsy feeling. A big problem if you're a programmer and use them frequently for debugging. It's also annoying that I have to choose between volume controls and F10 F11 F12 - the switch to go back and forth is not ideal.If I could do it all over I wouldn't buy this keyboard - I'd find a wired one with an ergonomic layout instead. The mouse is fine (Besides occasional lag)
2,I typically love Microsoft products and I really really how this keyboard looks and feels.  However there is a small issue on the keyboard that keeps creeping up.  The period and question mark are hard to hit.  I often make the mistake of hitting the button under the period which brings up a menu.  I thought that I would get used to this over time so I didn't return it or put a negative review earlier.  However I'm significantly slower in typing because I have to slow down to be careful on that.  I'm unsure if it's just me but if you find you're doing it too it doesn't seem to get better.
5,I was surprised when I opened the package. For some reason I thought this was flat. What a great surprise. The level is perfect for my carpal tunnel. The mouse too! I wish the key pad was attached instead of separate but this is great. I type even faster with less stress.
2,I have this for my work and home office. The one at my work I’ve had for years without any problems. This one that I ordered for my home office I had for 4 months now and it doesn’t work half the time. It’s not the batteries... not sure what it is. It’ll work on and off. Which is really frustrating when I’m trying to work and the price of this isn’t cheap.  I don’t know why I’ve had one for years without a problem and this new one is not working right. Maybe it’s just the luck of the draw... just be aware
5,I've been through many keyboards since I need perfection in ergonomics.  This keyboard is one of the best purchases I've ever made.  Not going to bore you with details.  It is a dream realized.
2,While I like this keyboard a lot (once you get used to it) it has one serious design flaw in that when you've engaged the CAPS LOCK button it doesn't have a light on that key so you can't tell at a glance that the feature is engaged. This has caused countless problems with entering "incorrect" passwords because of that locking me out of systems and causing needless delays. Simply because of this thoughtless design flaw I would not recommend this product.
5,Very good purchase.  Got used to it very quickly
1,Bought this product mainly to use at work because I was looking for a keyboard with an optional separate numeric pad. I had to resort to home use given the numeric pad stopped working about a week after I received the product. First instinct was to replace the battery which is hard to get to (no standard screwdrivers wo the job) and even harder to find ( I found it at a outdoors store after trying multiple office product stores and convenience stores). After replacing the battery the pad worked fine for about a couple weeks then stopped working again. I am on my fourth battery and it is virtually impossible to reach the proper Microsoft support department just to get a warranty replacement. I have been a lifelong Microsoft supporter but starting to seriously reconsider; I have had similar and worse experiences with other products.Keyboard itself works great but in my case product seems like a waste of $$ at this point given why I was attracted to it. I am still trying to get ahold of Microsoft and will post any updates.
4,Mouse it too big for my hands.  Our ergo consultant said it is too big for most people's hands.  The broken keyboard is great though.  My wrists feel a lot better after using the keyboard for a week+
5,Big hit.  My wife ordered this for her Photoshop computer.  She had reservations about the separate numeric pad and also the "funny shaped" mouse.  Both turned out to be perfect.  Microsoft invented the "Natural" keyboard and I've used them since about 1995.  They work and this one is the latest in the line of repetitive stress syndrome reducing keyboards.  Highly recommended.
5,Great improvement from the Microsoft Natural - the new style of keys are excellent (much less mushy than the Natural) and the keyboard and mouse are solid and well-built. My only dislike are the function keys - they seem to be really cheapy - but it's still my favorite keyboard.
3,It felt like a decent product a good weight but not bulky.  However I couldn't get used to it and it seemed to drop connection a lot with bluetooth.  I didn't use the dongle (I don't recall if it even had one).  I sent it back.
5,Lo compre porque estaba buscando un teclado ergonomico con buena sensacion tactil
3,I really really like the feel of the key board mouse and detached number pad.  All good. However the dongle is now malfunctioning AGAIN (2nd set in a year and a half).  Microsoft will replace the entire set for free but I can't go through the hassle again.
2,This is my second time buying this item. First time it worked well for the first year. But after the first year the mouse started to have issues (i.e. non-responsive at times) and the keyboard cushion at the bottom started to look gross. I ordered a new one since I enjoyed the ergonomic feel but this one (and now the old one) has some glitches. When I'm typing it would sometimes get "stuck" on a key. In other words the keyboard still thinks I'm holding down on that one key. This has become very annoying! Two different keyboards with issues...it's definitely not a coincidence at this point.
5,This keyboard and mouse combo takes some getting used to and you have to make sure you have an ergonomic arrangement as far as your desk goes but overall I'm very happy. The feedback on the keyboard is nice low-resistance similar to the new laptop keyboards. I do with the keys lit up at night but that's a minor detail. Mouse takes some getting used to but "normal" mice feel awkward and uncomfortable after using this.
2,I really love the shape and feel of the keyboard and mouse but the connectivity between keyboard mouse and computer is terrible. I have had to get a usb extension cable and run it from the computer right next to the keyboard and plug the usb RF adapter in just inches away or the keyboard skips keystrokes and the mouse is jumpy. With the RF adapter right next to the keyboard it seems to work most the time but I would much rather have a wired keyboard that never makes mistakes especially since I have to 1- use a usb port anyway and 2- have a usb cable running from my machine all the way to the keyboard anyway.
5,The best keyboard I ever had. The mouse so so I still prefer the Logitech ergonomic trackball. I'd wish they had a spanish language version and also to include the keys that type "more than" and "less than" symbols. Buth besides that it's great!!!
4,Not much to add.  Took a little while to become accustomed to the new hand positions:  farther apart than used to and the different location of some of the right-hand keys but it's a very nice light convenient keyboard whose ergonomic design is well serving its intention.
5,I have had bilateral carpal tunnel surgery in the past.  I am an RN and am changing careers.  I will shortly become a Medical Transcriptionist which means I will be doing lots of typing.  My son is a professional computer programmer and highly recommended the Microsoft Sculpt keyboard.  I hated it for the first 3 or 4 days because keystroke spacing and "normal" reach positions are slightly different.  I have finally learned the mechanics and now I am sold!
1,The first one I bought would be rated at 5 stars. Loved the ergonomics layout and everything about the MS Keyboard/Mouse and it was by far the best keyboard/mouse I've ever owned. Then the USB wireless got flaky (took about a year) and the mouse stopped working. This USB part is hard coded to the hardware and cannot be replaced. This is BY DESIGN. Whoever thought this was a good design should be slapped about the face with a fish (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9SSOWORzw4). So I got another one. This time the USB wireless connector got bumped/bent after a few months and it quit working. So I bought yet another one. If it weren't for the fact that I spend over 6 hours a day typing and using the mouse I would just buy something else. But yes the layout are ergonomics are that good that I'm willing to spend ~ $0.50 per day for a good keyboard and mouse.TL;DR: it's wonderful unless something happens to your wireless USB connector; then it's useless.
4,A great Ergonomic keyboard.  The only downside is the latency between the board and the computer.  Depress the caps lock and start typing and you'll find two or more of your first letters are not caps.  Minor irritant but never the less still aggravating.
5,The best keyboard and mouse I've ever used. The mouse is effortless. My hand and elbow stopped hurting within days of purchasing this item.I couldn't get it to pair with my IMac at first and called Apple support. He asked me if I read the manual and I had not. I read the first two pages and following the prompts from IMac. No other software was neededwhich Apple Care tech said too.Very happy.
3,I had hoped to use this with the built-in bluetooth so I didn't have to use a USB port.  You have to use the dongle apparently.  I would have bought something else.The wrist rest is huge. Takes up a lot of desk space if it's limited.
5,It's a little embarrassing how excited I am about this desktop set. The keyboard combines the best parts of Apple's chiclet keys and Microsoft's ergonomic keyboard line while taking up as little desk space as possible. The mouse is almost up there with the old Microsoft Bluetrack (I left mine at my old job and will never forgive myself). It feels like a softball in my hand which is surprisingly comfortable. Worth every penny.
3,I have owned a number of Microsoft keyboards prior to this going back to around 1995.  I like the product but I had the 'c' key refuse to work in combination with shift after only about 7 months.  First time I've had one of these keyboards break on me.  Trying to reach someone at Microsoft to discuss was impossible.  Their support people had no idea where to send me and the phone lines would disconnect me when I was transferred.  Very frustrating.
4,After a few days of use I have to say that this is the most well designed keyboard set i've ever owned.  The mouse in particular is so comfortable to use for a heavy computer user like myself.  Love that the number pad is separate...these guys really thought through everything here.
4,after a long time finally i received my keyboard and mouse they look very gorgeous.but after my exciting I found in the bottom of the keyboard there is a little white spot which looks like the keyboard has been hit. maybe it's hurt during the transportation to my home. except that this product is great!
4,Work good but keyboard has some delay issues at initiating of first key stroke. Probably a result of sleep mode to save batteries from always being active
4,The problem is that the USB receiver is very poorly constructed.  One wrong move it breaks and  you have to replace the entirekeyboard -- if Microsoft is so kind!
4,I just received the keyboard. Love the feel and the look. I like the MSFT ergonomic keyboards. I have broad shoulders and the standard keyboards just don't fit me. I like the separate number pad. I can move it where I want it. The mouse? eh... I don't use it. I will stay with my Logitech mouse.
3,Would be 4 stars but the space bar is really annoying.  It doesn't work if you press toward the bottom of the bar...Only when you press the top or middle of the bar.  I end up with several missing spaces.  I have to retrain myself to hit the spacebar accurately.  Otherwise it works as intended love the tactile feel.
4,What more is there to say. I'm in accounting and love the separate ten key! Love everything about it except that the ten key  takes a very rare and hard to find battery lol not expensive though :)
2,This is a beautiful keyboard. It feels good the position is great....BUT...in order to save some inches and make it very compact they've sacrificed the position of the arrow/home/insert and other buttons. This is a desk keyboard I'm not sure why the company aimed to make it as small as possible. I would never use this as a mobile or portable keyboard.Transitioning to this keyboard is very hard due to the fact that they've reordered the keys. Take a good look on the keyboard layout prior to purchasing it. I would love for them to recreate this exact keyboard with their original layout.
2,After using the Natural Keyboard models from Microsoft for many years I expected a step forward. Instead this introduced latency (wireless) to the mix as well as a completely separate numeric pad not to mention a build it wrist rest that instantly absorbs any and all skin oils that you will constantly be attempting to clean. I gave this a few days to grow accustomed but it just was not happening. The mouse in particular was the most difficult part to get into. The worst issue was not the size (it was like navigating an alien ship) but the middle click. Middle clicking would activate the horizontal scroll since the mechanism was poorly manufactured. Very disappointing from Microsoft. Back to the 4000 model Natural for me.
2,First off I received this item with dead batteries in the box. After I replaced those the keyboard and number pad worked fine but the mouse would not. I looked at some Microsoft forums and apparently this is a known issue. The connection is set up with encryption at the factory so there is no way re-pair it yourself. The mouse is getting power based on the status light but not talking to the dongle. Seems like Amazon Warehouse re sold me a defective item. Will be buying a replacement elsewhere as I already have another one of these and it works great.
2,If you use the numeric keypad a lot and are used to it being attached then the fact that it is separate may be a problem for you as it is for me.  This is especially true if you use the "negative" angle attachment under your wrists as then the numeric keypad is at a different height and angle on the desk than the keyboard which is not ergonomic at all. You then have to prop up one side of the keypad for it to be even.  The actual keys are Chiclet type and not full traditional substantial keys.  I have the Microsoft 4000 and the Kensington Wave and this setup is a disappointment for me.
1,This keyboard and mouse lasted a little over a month and I guess I cannot return it after 30. It worked fine for a month. Then things started going haywire; windows started popping open strange keys started firing. I took the keyboard out of the equation and it worked for another few days then the same problems started happening just with the mouse. So obviously the broadcasting between the mouse and the dongle is the issue (and they are less than 10 inches from each other because I run this from my docked laptop). Total garbage. I went to a different keyboard and everything was fine. The keyboard and mouse itself were nice but I have to say had a bit of the "chicklet" feel and I was missing a more solid keypress not long after buying this. Still I would have found a use for this if it worked I have other computers. And with no return policy after 30 days looks like the joke is on me. Highly recommend that you avoid buying this or anything else you cannot return when it stops working after 31 days.
5,Have purchased this for two staff members that were having problems with their wrists.  Possibly experiencing Carpal Tunnel symptoms and the new keyboard has alleviated some of the pain.
5,Wrist rest very comfortable pad and when the riser is attached it matches the height of arm rests on chair so wrists are not flexed. Large mouse fits perfectly in palm of hand again match height of arms wrist. And then the separate keyboard helps move mouse pad closer to width of arms on chair. The best ergo set up I have had and easy to install.
4,Great keyboard for someone who loves the MS ergonomic keyboards. Easy to type on decent key action and at a good angle for typing and minimizing wrist pronation.The mouse on the other hand feels clumsy in my hand. I find it hard to hit the side buttons and I prefer my Apple Magic Trackpad.
5,I love the size and it feels comfortable i love the fact that i can transported in my backpack and close the zipper at the same time lol my old one never fit in my backpack.
5,I love this keyboard and especially love that it’s wireless.  I also like having a separate number keyboard for numbers.  Easier to type numbers for former 10 key operators.  The keyboard also contains the numbers.
1,Looks good but I hated the keyboard after typing for more than 25 years this flimsy keyboard makes it impossible to cut and paste hit windows key combinations or do routine tasks. I had to hunt for every key. In contrast the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 is great I've owned a couple and the one I have now has been going strong for 8+ years. This keyboard has a faux rubber wrist material that discolors when it absorbs sweat and oils from your hand and it cannot be cleaned because the material absorbs water and nearly rips off during gentle cleaning. Not to mention the thin and inadequate wrist padding underneath that is more of a burden than a blessing. I own three of the mice which I also really like but when it shares a connection with the keyboard the mouse must be within a couple feet of the usb transmitter or the signal degrades to an unacceptable level. Did I say I hate this combo?
5,I am not a 'coder' or 'developer' but I spend hours and hours writing emails reviews and documentation.  I have had multiple ergonomic and mechanical keyboards in my life.  I have to say for daily business tasks this keyboard and mouse are great.  it allows for the change of setup to vary my wrist position throughout the day.I use a mechanical keyboard (Razer Black Widow Ultimate) at home but at work I use one of these extensively.
4,Have this connected via a Targus DisplayLink hub and it's been great.  I've used the natural keyboard before and this one carries on the tradition  in fine style.  Looks good keys are comfy the separate keypad is very nice the mouse (while bulky) is really pretty handy if you're a Win8 user.
2,This is a very stylish ergonomic keyboard package.  I bought it to replace my decade old Kinesis Maxim.  I really like almost everything about the Sculpt - it is slick small ergonomic and has a full key set.  The separate  numeric pad is nice too.  I found the mouse ergonomically shaped but too heavy due to the two AA batteries that power it.The problem with the keyboard is simple - the function keys stick.  Half of the time that I press F5 it stays pressed.  Most other function keys stick on a regular basis.  Now Amazon delivered a replacement keyboard for me.  It had the exact problem.If it were not for the function keys sticking this keyboard set would get five stars.  Being a programmer I need those keys...
1,Although I received the keyboard and mouse about a month ago I started using it only three weeks ago. It died today!!! I replaced the batteries and it works for maybe 2-5 min and then it dies again! So annoyed! This thing is so comfortable :'(
1,I have 2 of these one for my home office and the other for my office-office.  I purchased one from Amazon and 1 from Best Buy (And paid for the replacement warranty). I do not move or commute with these keyboards they are at my desk and remain unmoved but they just break for no reason and Microsoft offers no replacement dongle.lThe one I purchased from best buy has been replaced twice there is a cost to this but at least I can replace them.The one from Amazon is now broken - again for no reason it worked yesterday night and hasn't been touched since but now I'm left with no solutions since it is outside of the return window.Great keyboard when it works but it WILL break for you for no reason and there are no options when that happens.
5,Love it.  I had the older Microsoft Ergonomic keyboard with the media buttons across the top and I had NO IDEA how huge that keyboard was until I put this one down next to it.  Took a day or two to get used to the slightly different angle / orientation but got over that quickly and LOVE this keyboard separate 10 key.  The mouse is a little big for me and my hands but I'm getting used to it.
4,The mouse is way too big for my small hands but other than that I love the wireless aspect and the separated 10 key. Makes it more portable.I had been having problems with my wrist typing on my laptop at work and this definitely helped it. Felt a difference within a few days.
5,Outstanding keyboard and mouse solution.  Very responsive keys and a unique mouse contoured to my hand.  The solution is more expensive than most other options but well worth the money.  It's actually the second time I've purchased this keyboard option having left my last one at my last work.
5,This is a great keyboard.  Takes about a day to get fully used to the layout but the combination of split keyboard and large ergonomic mouse is great.  I type a lot everyday and really appreciate the speed and accuracy.  Batteries seem to last forever.  Would definitely purchase again.  No problems keeping linked through the USB dongle.  Had lots of problems with other wireless devices.
2,Fantastic keyboard and mouse if only the dongle was better this would be a 5.I was just about to buy another one for the home office when the dongle broke under very little load.  The dongle is very weak and Microsoft won't replace it. I tried calling them three times.  You can't re-pair it with another dongle.  If you get this keyboard be very gentle with the dongle.  Always store it inside the mouse never leave it sticking out the side of your laptop.  Once you break that thing just throw away everything else.
5,Bought this for work to replace an older model.  Was not sure about the design or the split keyboard but absolutely love it.  Can set the keypad anywhere.  The mouse is chunky but still comfortable
5,Great keyboard once you get use to it. The big difference is in the mouse. My wrist no longer gets sore after long days doing cad work. I have recommended this set to manny people and so far they have all liked it.
5,I liked this keyboard so much I got a second for work. Easy to set up. Feels great to use.Note: it dose  feel odd  The 1st time you use it. However you adjust to it quickly.
1,The wireless connection between the keyboard/mouse and the dongle is awful. It drops lags or otherwise has issues sporadically throughout the day.On my computer setup the dongle needs to be placed with 6 inches of the keyboard for it to work and even then it loses connection or omits random characters while I'm typing a few times an hour. The mouse has similar issue where it lags if too far from the dongle.I've checked to ensure I'm using recent drivers and have plugged the dongle into both USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports as I read the 2.0 port is preferred. Nothing solves the problem.I wish I had purchased the wired version given the limitations and poor wireless performance.The comfort of the keyboard itself is fine.
5,I have been using this split-board design keyboard for a long time.  I suffer from extreme wrist pain without it.  The number pad is remote so you can walk around with it and/or use it like a calculator.  Mouse is very comfortable and east to use.  Switching to this type of keyboard takes a little getting used to but once you switch you won't go back to standard.
5,Great Quality & Feel.  I've been using this for a few months now and it is holding up great.  Having the number keypad separate was a bid odd at first but it didn't take long to get used to.
1,Not sure what the deal with this keyboard is but every day in the afternoon it seems to get 'tired' and quit working. I type - but it can't keep up. I can't plug it in because it's wireless - so I'm just screwed. I try resetting it but it doesn't work. Not happy. The mouse does NOT work with multiple monitors. Get's stuck on the screen jumps all over and can't go where it should. Threw both out.I'm adding to this review as this keyboard is HORRIBLE - it misses letters delays can't keep up with my typing. I'm past my return date so huge waste of money. Mouse it terrible with any dock extension. Waste of money
5,I really like this key board.  it is comfortable to my hands when wearing carpal tunnel braces.  The hand angle is nice.  The overall size is smaller than expected with I really like.  I have a lot more space on my desk.  I like the mouse too.  I haven't used the number square yet.
5,By and large an excellent choice. I love the calculator button on the number pad. It needs a comma. The biggest issue is the rubberized arm rest gets gritty and is difficult to clean.
4,Nice shape form and function. I really enjoy having the 10-key separate as I can move it closer when needed or out of the way when it's not.The triple A batteries in the keyboard only lasted a month. Not very long to me but so far that's been the only downside.
3,I USUALLY LIKE EVERYTHING WITH THE MICROSOFT BRAND AND IT LOOKS AS IF THE DECALS WITH STAY CLEARLY VISIABLE ON THE KEYS.  SINCE IT IS WIRELESS I MUST FIND SOME KIND OF MOUSEPAD THAT WILL KEEP THE MUSE FROM LANDING ON THE FLOOR.  THE RECEIVER WITHIN THE MOUSE ALSO CONTROLS THE KEYBOARD.  GOOD UNIT
4,This is a great design.  It's taken me some time to get used to the number pad being detached from the keyboard but as s bookkeeper I've found that to be pretty handy.
5,This desktop combo is absolutely perfect.  I enjoy the flexibility in placement of the numeric keypad and the mouse and keyboard fit my hands perfectly.  I loathe having to use my colleagues' computers now with their less comfortable configurations.  I felt compelled to order one for my office and another for home and my fumbly fingers enjoy the same keyboard and mouse experience no matter where I am.
1,The dongle (wireless receiver) breaks easily and cannot be replaced.  I originally loved these devices.  Having a separate keypad was great as sometimes I didn't use the keyboard and it was nice to be able to just pull out the mouse and numeric keypad.  I travel with these devices so my review is based on my personal use.  If you don't travel the dongle may not break as easily but for me in less than 2 months the dongle started intermittently losing any signal from my devices.  After another month it has stopped working all together.The keyboard mouse and keypad are comfortable and very portable but I am no longer able to use them since the dongle stopped working and Microsoft does not offer any replacements.  If at some point Microsoft starts providing a replacement dongle or figures out a way to make it stronger like the Logitech dongles I would consider using it again.
5,i highly recommend this product! i have tried multiple products searching for the perfect ergonomic keyboard/mouse combo. this combo is 'the one' and has completely relieved any soreness in my wrist. i did need about 15 minutes to adjust to the contoured keyboard (key location) but once adjusted i would never want to return to a flat keyboard. and the mouse...fits perfectly in my hand! i know it's a little expensive but for me it is worth the money.
5,10 months later and original batteries are still kicking. Takes a minute to get used to shape of keyboard but once you do there is no going back. Also number pad the numbers are rubbing off
3,I had this for about a year and it worked well however the number pad just started to go out (would not process input when I typed) so I am returning it.  I see now that the price has increased which seems a bit ridiculous since I think it was overpriced to begin with and stopped functioning properly after a year.  I'll be purchasing a different ergonomic keyboard.
1,The scroll wheel stopped working in a matter of months. These geniuses also decided to not print the serial number on the mouse soci cannot replace it. Convenient for them.
3,Really liked this product when I first got it.  After a few months the keypad failed.  Microsoft provided a replacement product with only a little hassle.  Some of the keyboard keys need to be stroked gently or they get stuck under the bezel.  Little irritations like that turn a Five Star product into a Three.
2,There are connectivity issues frequently.  Considering what you’re paying it’s pretty ridiculous it has this obvious of a problem. I solved it by using a usb extension and putting the receiver next to the keyboard. The overall Look and feel is fine.
1,I dont often write reviews but this one is worth writing this review to let people know that I ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS KEYBOARD MOUSE OR KEYPAD IT IS QUITE POSSIBLY THE WORST KEYBOARD MOUSE KEYPAD IN EXISTENCE!!!! TOTALLY CUTS OUT BEING RIGHT AT THE DONGLE ALL OF THE TIME WITH NEW BATTERIES. I HONESTLY HAVE NEVER EVER SEEN OR USED SOMETHING THAT IS THIS BAD!!!! I UNDERSTAND THE POSSIBILITY OF CUTOUTS HERE AND THERE BUT NOT ALL OF THE TIME I MEAN TYPING IS/WAS HORRIBLE AND ITS NOT THE KEYS STARTED OUT OF THE BOX DOING THIS!!! LETTER MIGHT WORK THEN NOT THATS HOW I KNOW ITS NOT THE KEYS ALSO MOUSE DOES THE SAME AND SO DOES THE KEYPAD DOESNT MATTER WHAT PC NOR WETHER A METER OR A FOOT FROM THE DONGLE!!! I SAID WAS HORRIBLE BECAUSE I DONT USE IT ANYMORE WORST FRUSTRATION EVER!!!!!!
4,Solved lots of typing related problems this does take a while to get used to.Took one star off for the cheap-a$$ F keys. Seriously Microsoft dont you know people use this to program and need the F keys to control their debugging tools...
4,I love this keyboard and surprisingly the mouse is very comfortable. I was skeptical of it at first. My only complaint is that the number pad never worked. It's a big deal to me as I work with a lot of numbers and use it pretty regularly.
5,Wow do I love it them.  My wrists don't hurt anymore and nothing is tangled up in cords.  I also remember to take the dongle or whatever it called out before they switched our computers and reminded everyone with a wireless keyboard to do the same since I have read it's allmost impossible to replace it.  I would definately buy this again!!!
2,In less that a year the mouse stopped working properly. The separate numeric keypad is far more cumbersome than I had expected it to be and placement of certain keys on the keyboard are just simply strange. Even after a year I still regularly hit "insert" when I wanted "delete".Instead of having a key marked "Fn" to toggle the meanings of the function keys to their alternate meanings (screen brightness volume etc) there's a physical toggle switch. This is astonishingly poor design.I have now replaced this overpriced keyboard/mouse combo with a wired Adesso keyboard and a wired Pictec mouse.
2,I'm also a long-time MS Natural Keyboard user. Unfortunately it's nearly impossible to find them. So I looked to this combo but the keyboard and mice are hurting my wrists (I haven't every had wrist problems with mice or keyboards before) and the fact it uses a transceiver despite being Blutooth is a deal killer.Pros:Separate number padKeyboard keys feel good.Stylish low profileReasonable price.Cons:Uses transceiverMouse and keyboard both causing wrists to hurt. I can't quite figure out why the keyboard is hurting them. The mouse however is because (I think) it's just too big as most ergonomic mice seem to be (one size doesn't fit all).In short the set might work great for you. It would be good if you can try it before buying or have the option to easily return it.
4,I love it. This is the second one I've bought. One for home and one for work. My wrist and hands do not hurt and since I am on a computer all day that's a plus.
5,I use this on Windows and Linux. No complains. All buttons work.
5,I purchased this keyboard to reduce thumb and wrist pain.  It worked!  I spend 10+ hours daily pounding on a keyboard and have used the Microsoft split-key design for years.  The older 4000 and 7000 models were good - but this is fantastic.  My thumb and wrist arthritis pain is now manageable as the keys are closer together with a lower profile.  The mouse could have a better profile but overall - great!
5,This has been one of my best purchases.I am at a computer all day everyday for my job and the ergonomics of this has been so worth it on my wrists.  After a short adjustment period you'll be so happy with it.Everything feels high quality and has lasted now for 6 months.  It still looks new.  It's a little difficult to clean however because of the "laptop" style keys.So worth they money.
3,Mouse ok a very good improvement from Microsoft and a rarity. The keyboard does not live up to the manufacture's reputation. The touching/operation of the keys are sporadic and the apostrophe doesn't work the quotations comes up instead. I haven't checked everything yet but I'm hoping that's it. Other than the latter it's a great keyboard.After using this Microsoft junk I personally consider it should be replaced. The question is what can one trust from Microsoft?
5,Far and away the best keyboard I have ever used.  The angle is perfect and the keys are low impact which (at least my perception) makes typing faster and less work.  And it is soooo quiet - no more being on conference calls with people asking "who is killing their keyboard" while I am taking notes.  Also comes with software that is robust and offers nice customization options for mouse buttons etc...
1,My company has bought 6 of these keyboards of which 3 are operative after a few years of use.  They work until the extra-long dongle is bent or broken in two by an inadvertent impact then NOTHING can be salvaged.  The MS dongle protrudes 4x as far as a nano-dongle.  The MS keyboard mouse and 10-key are FACTORY CODED together... the parts are not interchangeable.  Broken dongle  means the dumpster for all the components.  After 3 broken dongles I learned my lesson and buy Logitech K860 keyboards for my company.  The K860 provides both 2.4GHz USB and bluetooth connections the Logitech nano-dongles are very short and unbreakable and Logitech components are INTERCHANGEABLE.  Lose the dongle... buy a new one for $15 MSRP or connect using BT.
5,This product is great for your hands/arms I would recommend it for anyone. The only pain is adjusting to the split in the keyboard but once you get past that it is wonderful.
5,I really like this. Have to get used to it but that has only taken a few hours. Know that the dongle is inside the mouse. Unlatch the back and pull it out. Really happy with the purchase.
2,I hope I'm able to write this without my keyboard stopping to work.  It seems the USB dongle to the keyboard has an issue.  I have had this keyboard mouse and number keypad for less than 2 months and the keyboard is now failing often.  It seems to work for only about 5 minutes and then I have to re-position the batteries so that it will work again.  I tried replacing the batteries but I still have the same issue.  I sure hope Microsoft will help me out here because this is really cutting back on my effectiveness at the office.
5,I love this mouse and keyboard! I was having really bad wrist pain and my wrist pain is completely gone after using this! The mouse and keyboard were recommended to me by an ergonomic specialist.
5,Had not used this configuration prior to ordering. Read reviews on several sites. People seemed to either love it or totally hate it.  When my keyboard started sticking keys I decided to take a chance on the Ergonomic. Best keyboard ever!!!  It causes me to sit straighter and thus my shoulders don't ache after sitting at computer for a few hours.
5,I have two of these--one for home and one for work. I spend most of my time at work typing and this keyboard helped significantly with wrist pain I was having. The mouse is also very comfortable. I have had a few ergonomic mouses and this is my favorite.
5,It is an adjustment to get used to the keyboard positioning.  I am making a lot of typing errors...but my arms feel very good!! Worth the time it will take to adjust my typing skills!
5,Microsoft produces easily the best essential computer hardware around. Whether it was the Original Natural Keyboard with its split design or this Sculpt with its ergonomic focus or the Arc Mouse - the designs are masterpieces. I love this product just as much as all the others I have.
3,The keyboard is solid and I love the cushion like feel for the palm rest. Also the function keys have a switch so you don't have to double press the function key with the num key. My only complaint is the mouse and i think it'll take some time for me to get used to... if I do ever get used to it. I've been struggling with the new mouse for a day now... and feels awkward... this is my first time using an ergonomic keyboard and mouse.
3,I've had this for 1.5 years and it's a great keyboard; I like the way it feels.However the X button is already broken. It does not register when I press it anymore unless I press in a specific way with enough force. It is quite irritating as I'm typing and it does not register I have pressed x.
5,i use a keyboard and mouse all day for my job-- i have tried ergonomic keyboards/mice in the past and found them just too uncomfortable to take seriously.  I can't believe how quickly and how easily I adapted to this. I expected to dislike it but it is just the opposite. This is the most comfortable keyboard I have ever used. Also the mouse is very comfortable.
1,I've used Microsoft sculpted keyboards since they were offered.  I was lured by the design of this.  I do still love the design.  It's a smaller footprint than my wired series 4000.  I got used to the mouse.  I got used to the separate mousepad.What I could NOT get used to was the performance.On one the shift key would 'stick' so that characters after shift released would still be capitalized.  I learned to work around this by slowing down my typing.On the other however due to hardware (flexing of the unit while using the handrest and typing) problems key strokes that weren't made were being transmitted to the application - sometimes many keystokes and combinations - such that I could no longer trust using this to do production-critical software work.Nice design.  Too expensive.  Terrible performance.Do not buy this model.I'm sticking with my old clunky 4000 series.
5,Me encantó estoy muy contento con esta adquisición.
3,Good: The keyboard and the mouse look nice and modern.Bad:- The key layout is unusual. Microsoft changed the positions of Delete Home End PgUp PgDn keys and it's messy.- The function (F1..F12) keys and media keys are shared. Thus it's not convenient if you use function keys a lot but need hot key to change the speakers volume.- The mouse feels strange in my hand.- The software is limitted and thus the keys and buttons are not very customizable.
4,I love this product and have bought another one.  The biggest issue is that if you break the usb insert you have to buy a whole new product not just replace the usb insert.
3,My previous wireless keyboard kept skipping and would just stop working. I found this one and it works great.  The shape of the keyboard is comfortable for your fingers and wrists. The mouse is smooth and feels like it floats on a cloud.  With the 10-key not being attached it takes some getting use too. Since I use the 10-key a lot I've been having difficult with that part.  it would be nice if it attached and was at the same angle.
5,I use this keyboard at work and at home. I'm a programmer and spend much of my day typing so a good keyboard is a must for me. This keyboard has blows every other one out of the water. It feels great to use and allows me to type quickly with no wrist problems. It took me a few days to get used to the split layout but once I got past that it was smooth sailing.
5,Love the keyboard use it in a system where i switch between a mac and an windows 10 box.  They keyboard works flawlessly for both devices and love the ergonomic design.  It feels great!Microsoft makes the best keyboards.Even when using a mac this is probably the best feeling keyboard.
5,The first one I ordered was a did would not respond when typed on and the signal loss to the fob was sporadic. Amazon replaced it and the next one is perfect. No issues at all. Great keyboard very clean looking.
5,I am a Business Systems Analyist (developer) and after working on a keyboard for 28 years damage to the hands and wrists is immanent ; however this keyboard and mouse are soooooo comfortable to use and bring comfort to hands and wrists.  I HIGHLY recommend this product and let's face it if you don't like it Amazon WILL take it back and refund your money.  What more could you ask for?
5,Best ergonomic keyboard out there
5,This keyboard is the best I've ever owned.  Worth every penny it is easy to get used to just a little adjustment time.  Mouse is great.  Love the detached number keys.  And wireless!  It's even dare I say sexy as electronics can be.  You can tell a lot of thought and creativity went into this keyboard and mouse set.  Even the battery compartments are a breeze to open and shut.
5,I love the new design. The touch is so light. I've been working on computers for many years and the tendons in my hands and wrists have been screaming. I started working on the sculpt about 6 weeks ago and my hands and wrists are almost healed. The mouse takes some getting used to because it forces you to keep your wrist up but I still love it. Thank you Microsoft for a superior product.
5,Took me a few days to get use to it but I love it.  It feels so much more natural than the standard version.  Loved the mouse.  Now I need a left handed mouse just like it because I'm both handed!?
5,I have had this setup now for around 2 years and it works so well. I have had carpal tunnel issues in the past and this completely eliminates it. The mouse takes some getting used to but it now feels completely normal. The separate number pad is genius. Battery life is incredible. I have never changed the keyboard or numpad the mouse lasts around 9 months for me.
5,No wrist twist as it were no strain as I type. very comfortable. The slight tilt forward and down takes a little getting used to as does the placement of some of the keys but that adjustment doesnt take long and is well worth it in terms of comfort. I'll get each of my grand-kids one of their own for those rare occasions when theyre not on a Tablet or Phone!
5,Surprisingly stiff the small size is perfect.  The Key actions are great and the overall feel is perfect for long typing sessions.The Mouse was a little harder to get used to but that is because I was using a Logitech track pad that needed a hard press to react.  Once I got used to moving a mouse again the action proved fluid and the buttons just felt right.
1,Now I learned typing on a manual typewrite and and then to an IBM Selectric and made it to 115 words per minuted corrected.  For me there has never been a keyboard that allowed the feel of control.  I was hoping this would do the trick but it doesn't.  Just a glorified version of a laptop keyboard.  There is no feel to the keys so that you are never sure that your fingers start off on the right keys.  I am sure this would be great for someone whose typing is limited to emails and occasional notes but not for typing at great lengths.  If you do any extended typing such as 25 plus pages per day I think you will end up being frustrated and a bit tired.  The only start out of this is the mouse that came with it although I prefer a Logitech trackball instead.
2,The keyboard itself is amazing it relieved my pain I was having from carpel tunnel.  The USB  that plugs into your computer on the other hand does not last.  This connection went out on my twice. They replaced the first keyboard for free which was  very nice.  The second  time this went out I decided it was time to get something different as I rely on my keyboard for my job.  The connection went out 2 times within a 6 month period.. not good.
5,The best keyboard out there. Just wonderful to type on. Ergonomics are spot on. Mouse is heavy at the same time precise and accurate. Good grip. No hand pain whatsoever since i started using this combo. Just a joy to type on this.
5,I love an ergonomic keyboard...so much less strain on your wrists!  The detached number pad takes a little getting used to but it's kinda nice to be able to move it closer when you're doing a lot of number work...like in a spreadsheet.
5,I really like this combo two things that I am not super keen on would be the little selector on the top right hand corner for functions and F keys but my wrist are not in pain the mouse is great the side number pad is pretty good that's a little bit to get used to but overall very pleased with quality and looks and feels
3,I really loved this product. Great value and I want to give it FIVE stars but I have to give it three. I broke the usb dongle and I could not get it replaced which rendered all these products useless. $80 down the drain all for one proprietary usb/dongle piece. Lame.
5,Nice ergonomic design on both keyboard and mouse and a comfortable wrist pad on the keyboard.  I like the detached num-pad a lot as I can leave it out of the way when I'm not using it and get more desk space and the calculator button is a nice touch.
5,Best Keyboard/Mouse combo out there for office use. Very comfortable.  It took a couple of weeks to get used to the "ball in hand" mouse but after I did I won't go back to a flat mouse again. Only issue is the ESC key can be hard to hit quickly.
5,I love this keyboard number pad and mouse combination.  The keyboard is the perfect angle to accommodate my typing position.  The separate number pad means I can put the pad anywhere I want it.  The baseball mouse as some have called it is the perfect fit for my hand.  It keeps the hand in a more open position and therefore a more relaxed position.
3,No backlight. It always takes a little getting used to a new keyboard--especially an ergonomic.  I keep it under the desk so when a key is not where I expected I have pull the whole board all the way out into the light to see where the key I want is located.
3,Great feeling keyboard but the CTRL key stopped working for me after about 6 months on one of them (I eventually bought 3).  Be careful where you buy this from though.  With a discount I paid around $65 or so from amazon.  I bought my first one at Staples and paid around $80 but Office Depot wanted $120.
5,I bought this keyboard after reading a number of recommendations from occupational therapists for people with hand wrist and shoulder problems.  I have all three.  I am so glad I got this keyboard.  The more narrow width by not having the number pad attached and the unique shape have helped my pain tremendously.
5,I'm traveling and working remotely on my laptop. My neck was hurting a lot from the bad posture. This bought this with a   Pyle PLPTS55 - Portable Folding Tabletop DJ Gear Stand for Laptop Mixer or Other Gear - Adjustable Angle and Height         and it is a really great setup.
5,As someone suffering from 'too much typing disease' (i.e. tendinitis in the left wrist and hand) and at the recommendation of my physical therapist the Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop keyboard/mouse has in the last 4-6 weeks proven to relieve a noticeable amount of stress on my wrist/hand. It works very well and has had the desired positive impact.
3,The keyboard is great but the mouse is designed to be held from the side not over the top and its waaaay too big for a woman with medium-to-small hands.  Questionable ergonomics!  I'm on the phone with Microsoft right now to see if they'll switch out the mouse.
3,I have been using the ergonomic keyboard for years.  I wish that Microsoft offered the previous version of the Natural keyboard in a bluetooth version.  This key board definitely takes some time to get used to.  The optional keyboard angle additional is not intuitive from a touch/feel perspective but is probably better from an ergonomic perspective.  Your hands are angled DOWN with this version.I am still using the keyboard and will probably continue to use it.
3,I'd probably give this keyboard a 5* except that the spacebar doesn't always work the first time I tap it. I'll then tap it a second time and it usually works. I probably should have returned it for a replacement but I had gotten rid of the packaging before realizing the problem.
5,Takes a minute to get used to typing on it but I love it now! The nurse at my work also loves the ergonomic design especially that you can ACTUALLY center the keyboard since the number pad is separate. And it clears your desk of pesky wires!
5,This is a nice package wireless keyboard and mouse. I use this same keyboard and mouse at home and now I just purchased it for my office. I also purchased one for an engineer in Maintenance. It is very comfortable to use and will help prevent carpal tunnel. I also use them with my Microsoft Surface 3. Thanks Microsoft for another great product.
5,Takes a little getting use to as with anything new.  Absolutely love the sleek keyboard. It is quiet and ergonomic so your hands are in a natural position. Detached 10-key allows you to move it around or hide it altogether saving valuable desk space. I would recommend this keyboard to anyone.
3,Buy the warranty for $1.00. Some of my keys are not working now and it doesn't look like i can return / exchange the item. $86.00 for a wireless keyboard that is already going out is frustrating!
1,This is the second time I bought this product and each time it works great initially but then begins to work on and off. I was told by Microsoft to unplug it because it might lose the signal you can only do that so many times before you become frustrated. Trying to contact Microsoft is a nightmare. They still have not called me back from the first time I bought the product and finally gave up this last time chalking it up to experience that Microsoft products are not quality products. The first one I bought lasted a year this second one I bought May 8 2018 it is January 6 2019 so it didn't even make it a year. Don't waste your money you will not be happy. At the price for each I am out almost $200.00.
5,What can I say? This is a very awesome keyboard to use for work. Working 40 hours behind a desk this keyboard is amazing! I got used to the layout very quick! Worth the money.
4,It flaked out once had to reboot and move it to different ports. keyboard takes some adjustment. It is more comfortable on my wrists.
3,Good keyboard except the arrow key configuration.  You don't get used to it.  I also don't care for not having my number pad attached.  I have to type it addresses often enough it's a bother.  Great keyboard otherwise.
1,The keyboard layout is not as good as the 7000 model but it is a great alternative to the $300+ price tag of that wireless desktop system.  It's wireless connectivity and space bar however are better than the 7000.  If you are a programmer and use your keyboard a lot though and have to have wireless I would recommend splurging on the 7000.  The 7000 is the best keyboard/mouse combination that I have ever used.Update:  After 1 and a half years the mouse completely died.  The buttons wouldn't click anymore.  After 2 and a half years the keyboard died.  Certain keys became unresponsive.  It happened all of a sudden and nothing would fix it.  I looked up the issue online and found some things that helped sometimes but it appears that something started causing it to register a function key all the time which messed up the response of other keys.It was nice while it lasted but not well made at all.
5,This is my second set I purchased.  Not becasue the first one failed but because I have been using the first set for about a year and wanted another set in a remote office.The wave split is super comfortable the mouse looks odd but works great and the numpad being un-tethered has turned out to work out fantastic for crunching numbers.
3,Looks great feels great has some issues with sticky keysssssssss not stopping.  Might be a driver issue.  I don't like the mouse its not bad just not my style too fat..  but already had a microsoft bluetooth mouse that I love that matches.  Compared to other options its one of the best avail.. 5 stars if I didn't have the sticky key issue
5,I have owned ALL of the natural keyboards. This one is the BEST. I love the separate 10 key cause I never used it anyway. The only issue I have with this keyboard is that it's 3 different kinds of batteries for the mouse keyboard and 10 key. Also in the keyboard center I can't disable the volume on screen display like with other MS keyboard sets.
4,It is nice for an ergonomic keyboard. My only complaint is the Esc key and row. They are of a different quality than the rest of the keyboard and are difficult to press (e.g. if you are a VI user) while typing normally.
3,Worked well but after a while the mouse started to consume batteries in a crazy rateNow new batteries are gone after a week and I am not a heavy user of any kind
3,Well a year in and having trouble with the mouse..  Doesn't seem to want to stay in place.  This is the second one.  For the price not very happy.  Keyboard going strong.Great replacement for the prior version.  Very happy with this purchase.
5,This was a bit pricey but incredibly comfortable so very worth it. I'd tried the Microsoft comfort sculpt desktop set which was a bit cheaper but returned it because it was horribly *un*comfortable to type with. This keyboard/mouse set is by far much more comfortable and your wrists will thank you!
5,Feels really different than normal keyboard might be a bit frustrating at the beginning but once you get used to it. You wouldn't go back to normal keyboards.
5,Love it!!! Takes some time to get used to but after that time - it's a breeze. My carpal tunnel symptoms were gone after couple of weeks and I never thought I can even dream about stopping or reversing the process. I spent 8 to 14 hours a days working on my computer and it has been such a change with this keyboard and mouse.
5,The keyboard is very well designed. Definitely a lot more comfortable for typing - especially useful when typing 2-3 pages at a time which I do quite often.The mouse is also very good. The nice rounded shape is a perfect shape for the hand to rest.
5,I am constantly writing long notes at my workplace into computer system and so any ergonomic stress-relief I can find I will take.  Its a very ergonomic keyboard very soft and low impact key-strokes. What I love the most is that it forces you (because of the incline angle of the keyboard and the mouse) to maintain proper wrist alignment thus avoiding carpal tunnel injuries. Highly recommended!!!
3,I love the keyboard and mouse and only until recently loved the number pad also. It decided to stop working.  I tried updating drivers replacing the battery and moving the receiver to a different USB port.  Still not working.  Not sure what to do.  ditch it or get a new one.
1,The keyboard was great for awhile but then the dongle started having issues with connectivity and a huge delay in response.  The mouse will sporadically and the keyboard will just stop working.  I have to play with the dongle usb connection to make it work and I realize there's a short in the dongle.  Applying slight pressure on the side will make it work even on different computers.  How good is the sauntering on the traces on the IC on the dongle?  I see why warranty $$ is offered...this is sad.  A cheaper off name brand keyboard works flawlessly for years but I wanted a wireless one because it cost more therefore thought it would be great long lasting quality.  Nope I'll never buy this again I'll go with a off name brand from now on.
5,I have carpal tunnel and Tendinitis.  The worst combo on waist and arm.  Tried many mouse and keyboard. This keyboard ease all pain once I set it up right.  The mouse is also at just the right size for my palm to rest on to work.
3,After about one and a half years of use left button of the mouse started to fail. I contacted the customer service and waiting to hear back. Otherwise it is good
5,Bought one for the secretary of the CEO at one of my workplaces. She loves it. Everyone walking by notices the keyboard and want one too. The CFO is getting one; I've now got one at my desk; and in the future I will be getting one for myself at home.Worth the 75 USD! You won't go wrong. Microsoft did very good here. :)
1,After a year the left mouse button intermittently stops responding.  Microsoft support is exasperating.  After 5 phone calls they send me a return form to fill out designed to be tedious and slow to complete (involves reading off 18 digit numbers printed inside the case of each of the three pieces in a tiny font).After several hours of phone calls and form filling they issue an RMA number.  I'm supposed to find a box and mail it back to them.  BUT they're out of stock of the replacement and they can't say how long it will be to get a new one.  They won't advance ship the replacement or even give me a date for how long I'm going to be keyboardless.
5,I love this keyboard because it is smaller than a the Microsoft regular ergonomic keyboard.  I don't need the calculator portion which saves space on my desk.  Allow yourself time to get use to the keyboard because it has a different feel than a regular keyboard. I have one at home and I purchased one for work.  I would buy them again!!
5,Love this keyboard.  I can type over 100 words per minute on it.  I'm spoiled forever and will never go back to the super clicky ancient ones.  The mouse is a great new design that takes a second to get used to but you'll be hooked.  Like I said in the title once I bought one for home I had to have one for the office.
1,In terms of design the unattached number-pad is a poor idea particularly if you've used a standard keyboard for years and are used to reaching for a specific spot to crank numbers. The pad is never in that spot. Even more frustrating is that the number-pad burned through the first battery in a few months and then has seemingly burned through the second battery even quicker. A very pricey item that falls far short of the 4+ rating others have given it.
4,It didn't really work for my keyboarding needs but it might for others.  The shipping packaging and description were fine.
5,This keyboard is for my wife.  She has not made one complaint since starting to use it.  She hated the regular keyboard.  The mouse has been good for her wrist.  It also seems to be more responsive than the previous mouse.  Good stuff!
4,Won't last very long but very comfortable while it does work.
3,I really do like the keyboard. Its quite comfortable. The one thing that really annoys me is that the cover for the mouse does not stay on! I can click it in but when I am using it it will randomly come off! If not for that I would rate it 5 stars. Maybe I got one that was defective? It seems like a silly problem to have.
1,Dont' purchase this keyboard. If you lose the dongle or it breaks you are up the creek and unable to do ANYthing about it.I purchased this keyboard combo less than a year ago. Unfortunatly the dongle broke and we need to get it replaced so we dont lose out on a $130 combo set. After just now getting off the phone with MS they said they cannot doing anything for me and ill need to purchase another set. I even offered to ship it to them and pay for a new dongle and programing to make it work again. They said there was nothing they could do.You need to purchase a Logitech combo at least you can reprogram a new dongle to their combo's if you lose or break a dongle.
3,The concept is good but it occupies a huge amount of space. For my desk the keyboard and mouse is supposed to be placed on the sliding tray underneath the desktop. It was too big and there is no space for the separate numeric pad. The mouse is kinda uncomfortable to use. I returned them without hesitation.
5,This is by far the best keyboard ever!! People are like what is that but yet once they sit down and use it!  THey are in love as well.
2,I've had a couple of these keyboards.  They look nice when you first get them but about a year later they definitely don't look so nice.  I really could care less about that.  What I do care about is the durability of the thing.  I've had two of these (I think I had three) that the USB dongle just fell apart.  And you can't replace it.  It's a pretty lame keyboard for as expensive as it is.
2,I have only had this product for about 8 months and it started going out after the 5th month. I thought it was the battery but I changed them all and it still goes out every other day...
4,The key action is very good and the shape is very comfortable to type on for long periods of time.  Only draw back is the number pad doesn't have a hand rest like the keypad so it is uneven.
3,Decent keyboard great shape and ergonomics. However if you are a Vi/Vim user the escape key is a disaster. It's a button instead of a proper key so it's very jarring to press it. I'm still getting used to the mouse so I can't comment but it seems like it'll be all right to use. The keypad is nice if you do a lot of data entry.
3,My space bar started squeaking after a couple of months and I bought one for a co-worker - his keyboard had two F11 keys in place of an F11 and F12. Still using them both but a bit disappointing for the price.
2,Beyond 1 meter range from the laptop the mouse starts lagging and stops working. I bought it to be able to connect the laptop to the TV and work from far it doesnt work.
5,I replaced my Wireless Desktop 7000 set with the Sculpt set. And I'm glad that I did! The keyboard is outstanding. It's light comfortable and resembles the Bluetooth Apple keyboards in terms of key feel. The mouse is just as comfortable as the 7000 series too. I thought that the separate number pad would be an issue but I don't think it will be. Big fan of this combo!
4,Really loving this keyboard and mouse. Not really sure how I feel yet about the number pad being separate. So far so good though. This may even increase my words per minute which was not the goal but never a bad thing.
5,The keyboard is definitely a bit different from a standard one and requires a bit of getting used to the differences in some key placements (like the page-up page-down delete etc. keys).  However if you are buying this like I did...to stop arm pain due to using standard keyboards for an extended amount of time you will not be disappointed.  Outstanding ergonomic support and everything I needed.
5,Love typing on this keyboard. The wrist rest is really comfortable and Mouse is a pure delight. This is my first ergonomic keyboard purchase and I am satisfied to beyond my expectation. Great product. Works on my Mac and Windows alike. !
5,I've been using this keyboard for well over a year and love it. It feels great to type on and the mouse is great as well. The mouse takes a while to get used to but feels awesome once you've gotten used to it.
5,I love the design it's very easy to get used to. It's quiet and really only needs a soft touch to type or 10 key.
3,Enjoy the ergonomic design of mouse and keyboard. However product would not work correctly with one of our windows computer in our organization and AAA batteries in keyboard drain incredibly fast (2 weeks max life).
5,Replaced my Microsoft Ergo 4000 kb with this kb/mouse set.  No complaints both are great for 10+ hours in the office.Nice weight to the mouse.
5,This keyboard/mouse took about a week to get use to but now I just love it.  The mouse fits your hand perfectly and seems more natural.  It's strange to use a "standard" mouse.  I wasn't sure if I would like the separate num pad but as it turns out I love that also.
5,Yes it looks odd.  But in works very well for managing hand pain. And it works on Mac's. The higher lift on the keyboard allows me to slide it over the top of my MacBook Air without hitting the  laptop's keys.  I've used the Microsoft Ergonomic since it was released  years ago. This is a significant advance at least for my hands.
4,It's been some time since I used an ergonomic keyboard as nice as this.  It's pricey but I think it's worth it.  The mouse will sell you though.  It looks ugly but works brilliantly!
3,Not a bad keyboard as long as you know what you're getting yourself into.  I suggest trying this out in a store before buying it as it's not for everyone.  This keyboard is raised a bit more than previous ergo keyboards.  I could not get used to the mouse at all though and had to stop using it altogether.  It is WAY too fat.
3,I HAVE NOT YET FINISHED DOWNLOADING.  THERE  ARE NO INSTRUCTIONS.  I POSTED A PLEA FOR HELP; ANOTHER AMAZON CUSTOMER TOLD ME WHAT TO DO.  I COULD NOT FIND THE SERIAL NUMBER SO I CALLED Microsoft TO FIND OUT WHERE TO FIND IT.  THE nut TOLD ME TO TAKE IT BACK IT WHERE I BOUGHT IT AND LET THEM SHOW ME!
4,Had to return the one I bought on Amazon because it was malfunctionning.Bought a brand new one and I am VERY happy with it.
4,The keyboard has not filled yet but the mouse Middle  scroll button does not fit  the hands at all.
4,Carpel tunnel is gone baby gone. I should note i use a Logitech rolling ball mouse which is the best mouse around. thanks.
5,The keyboard and mouse feel great on my wrists! With in minutes I could feel a difference a must if your going to do any typing for any long length of time. The only downside is the batteries for the number pad are harder to find.
3,With the exception of the detached keypad (which I HATE) I love the keyboard. The mouse is just OK. It just feels too bulky. I wanted to like this combo but it just doesn't do it for me.
5,This is an amazing keyboard. I got this after recommendation from an ergonomic expert. After I started using my wrist joints stopped hurting as well as tendinitis in my elbow went away. I bought a second one for home use as well.
1,The USB receiver was so long and flimsy that it broke within 5 months.  A waste of money for such an expensive keyboard.
2,This wireless keyboard mouse and detached numeric key pad combination is a great idea that's not so well executed for me at least.Before I get to my particular gripes I want to be clear that the manufacturing quality is superb. The keys feel great and the mouse is a nice for my medium-sized hands.On the down side:I found the mouse very "jumpy" compared to any other mouse I've owned and I tried all kinds of different pads and surfaces.The keyboard is "ergonomic" but I find it far from "natural" although I'm a touch-typist very accustomed to earlier Microsoft ergo keyboards.I'm going back to an earlier keyboard/mouse.  Darn!
4,The pad fades quickly where your hands rest. Other than that these combo are great. Like the fact that the number key pad can be moved out of the way for the mouse to be closer.
1,In the beginning I loved this Keyboard and Mouse combo. The layout of the keyboard was perfect for me. The size of the mouse was just right for big hand's. Then I started noticing issues with missing letters in emails and my mouse not responding to my gestures. I changed the batteries and that did not work. Unplugged the USB dongle and replugged it. That worked. Unfortunately I would have to remove the dongle about 2-3 times a day every day. Then today when I unplugged it the dongle snapped and won't work anymore. As many other people have stated this keyboard is dependent on the dongle and MS does not offer a replacement dongle. Its hard to justify another eighty something dollars when similar people have had similar issues. I guess its back to Logitech for now.
3,when i first opened the package the mouse was obviously used it had wear and tear marks on the bottom and was a bit dirty.  the keyboard and keypad were new  both nice and easy to you use once you get used to it.
5,Although the mouse took a little time in which to acclimate due to the round body I cannot ever imagine going back to by old mouse. The keyboard in which I am typing right now is one of the most comfortable and nice feeling keyboards I have ever used. It does not however help with spelling typing or grammar... Chagrin.
5,I love this keyboard.  Over the several Microsoft keyboards I've bought over the last sixteen years this is my favorite; with the Microsoft Wedge Mobile Keyboard being my second favorite.I dislike having the numeric keypad on the right side.
5,Love this keyboard set! I like the changes from the older model that I had. The design is slim sleek and comfortable. I use this set religiously! Highly recommend.
5,A great keyboard I am a developer and use it with a Macbook. Map a few keys and it is very good. Nice build quality.
5,This is the most awesome keyboard I have used so far.  It is the perfect size travels in my bag nicely for work.  and I haven't even had it for 24 hours yet!!  love it.  Even the mouse is left handed.  so comfy!!
5,The best keyboard ever. I love having the numeric keypad separate; it allows me to keep my arm in closer to my body so the arthritis doesn't complain as much :)
5,I type at work a lot and this keyboard is comfortable (especially with the elevated wrist rest attached).  Yeah the whole thing takes an adjustment period and weirds people out when they first try it but this is for long term usage and prevention of repetitive motion stress injuries.  And it's a high quality piece of equipment.
4,Gets dirty quickly due to material used for padding. Overall is a great keyboard.
5,The price for the keyboard is super. Cheaper on amazon then anywhere else.  Microsoft has really outdone themselves this keyboard.  It is so comfortable to use.  The buttons are soft and if you are a fast typist this is a must have tool I am using this unit with my mac book pro because I hate apple keyboards too small for me.
5,Amazing keyboard. And looks really cool. Love the separate number keypad. Love the mac like key tapping. Works great. Surprised you don't see this in the store more. I had switched to the "ergo" keyboard you find in the store which were really just slanted a little. This is a true ergo split keyboard. Nice cushy wrist rest. Able to personalize the mouse actions/buttons.
4,Very nice combo kit.  It is not Bluetooth but uses a W-iFi dongle which is included.  I would have rated it higher if it had been Bluetooth rather than Wi-Fi since it took up one of my USB ports.
5,I love the feel of the keyboard and the mouse.  This is the best ergonomic keyboard that I have used.
1,Save your money. I've loved Microsoft gear for decades but this it the bargain basement utiity wise. The number keys on the main keyboard are so difficult to press down at the beginning of a field that usually even banging on it it takes 2-4 tries to get it to react at all. Oddly this doesn't happen when a field is already started and you're in the middle of a sentence. But tab to another field and start typing and you get the same impossible requisite pressure to start a field with a number key. I wouldn't take one of these for free and for the first time I couldn't be any more disappointed in a microsoft product.
5,Wwwwq
2,The keyboard and mouse themselves are fantastic... but the USB connection is very spotty. I frequently have to restart my computer to get the USB to register and I have flip it between USB ports multiple times a day otherwise only half the keystrokes register and mouse is super jumpy. I thought it my computer at first but the same holds on the other computers I've tried.If it was bluetooth... or the USB worked reliability then I'd be a 5 star.
5,This keyboard is replacing my old Microsoft Ergonomic keyboard which had some issues with the keys being extremely hard to press.  This keyboard is lightweight smooth to touch easy to clean and pretty cute!  The mouse is awesome and I personally don't mind that the keypad is separate from the keyboard.  Glad I made the purchase.  Would definitely recommend.
5,Bought it Feb 2018 batteries are still Running. Never turned it off Works with my Three machines with a kvm shared.Love it
3,Great keyboard it is thin and well crafted. I have some issues with keys sticking and sometimes I press a key and nothing happens. Also I am not sure why the function key is a toggle switch instead of a push button. Who wants there keyboard to be in FN mode for a long duration? Not I...
1,Excellent keyboard!  Takes very little time to get used to the layout.  Mouse feels excellent in the palm.  Haven't really found a good place to keep the separate number pad but it's there and it works.*** April 12 2019 ** Updated review.  Originally I gave this system 5 stars due to the comfort of the keyboard mostly. Through no fault of Microsoft I broke the USB dongle.  Now I want to replace the dongle and I am told that you can't do that. Microsoft supposedly keys each dongle to the keyboard/mouse and there's no way to change that. So now I have $88 worth of trash on my desk. I replaced this set with the Logitech WAVE which is not quite as ergonomic for me but at least has a unifying receiver so if I break another dongle it's only $5.99 to get a replacement.
2,Not programmable cannot pair with devices no instructions available.  Plus:  it is definitely plug and play enabled there is NO SOFTWARE for it.  Difficult touch transition from "normal" ergonomic keyboards requiring extremely different hand location and reach.  I am a VERY fast typist with extreme accuracy and with this keyboard I make countless errors.  Recommend only for people with large hands and extended reach.  They can do better - check out the next generation on this one which is Bluetooth and offers many more features.
1,I have bought 3 of these keyboards in the last 3 1/2 years.  The first one lasted 2 years the second about 6 months and the 3rd 1 year.  I love this keyboard and my wrist hasn't hurt since I started using it.  However I will be looking for something different now as I can't keep purchasing a new keybaord every year.
5,Replaced old keyboard of the exact same design where I wore off all the letters cause I type like a demon.  It works and it’s pretty.
5,Great!
3,This is a big upgrade from the MS Natural 4000 fixing many of its flaws. One of the big issues I have with the Sculpt is the F keys – they are not keys but buttons. There's no feedback as to when it's been triggered and without looking you can't tell what one is what. There are no bumps or gaps so everything from Esc to Calculator blend together.
4,Great keyboard but breaks down too quickly.
5,This Keyboard ensures that I have no issues with my wrists and I they no longer hurt at the end of the day. Also this keyboard is the best I have used in my ten years in IT.
2,Loved the layout of the keyboard and hoped it would work but unfortunately as some other reviewers had already pointed out this keyboard and number pad misses keystrokes.I've noticed that its always the first key of a word or a sentence that gets missed.I think this is due to the keyboard going to sleep and it takes one key stroke to wake up. This ens up causing mistakes and lost time while typing.I called Microsoft tech support but they didn't tell me anything coherent to resolve the issue.
5,Best keyboard ever... That's what I call a wireless lightweight keyboard. The great design and Microsoft quality makes this keyboard a must buy. I got one for personal use and one for my office.PS: it will take you a day or so to get familiar to the new shape and to find the letters faster :)
2,I love this keyboard and mouse however out of the blue the mouse/keyboard stopped working and my computer was giving me an error stating that the mouse is no longer compatible with the computer! I would love to replace this mouse & keyboard however was hoping that Amazon could provide me with a new one since it malfunctioned however come to find out I can no longer return this item.....I have carpal tunnel and find this mouse and keyboard to ease some of the difficulties I experience when typing. The keys get some used to however the mouse is a great fit.
1,Update:  5 weeks after purchase which means one week after return window closed and the usb dongle has died!! Cant order a replacement because the dongles are specific to the keyboard and mouse they come with.ORIGINAL review: Second time I've bought this keyboard. I love the feel of the keys which are responsive and quiet. Its compact size and separate numeric keypad make it really easy for a right-handed person to reach the mouse and consequently increases the amount of time I can work without experiencing shoulder neck and back pain. The keys tend to stick over time but my last one lasted a couple of years which was good enough for me. I can type faster on this keyboard than on any other I've used in the past 15 years.
5,Got one for work and liked it enough I purchased another for our home-office. The separate number pad is way more handy than I expected it to be and the mouse and keyboard are configured really well for ergonomics.
3,Somewhat disappointing as the angle for the ergonomic layout was too great. I never got used to it and used it diligently to the exclusion of all others for about 8 months before the letter M on the keyboard stopped working. Things went from bad to worse then and I gave up and bought something else.
3,Quality of keyboard/mouse are fine however every week or so they forget how to communicate with my computer and I have to reinstall the drivers. Until the drivers are reinstalled any key pressing on the keyboard causes the computer to crash and gives an error before restarting.
5,Replaced my Logitech Wave after many years. I loved the Logitech for its comfort but the mouse sometimes lost radio contact. I prefer this one because I don't use the numeric keypad and therefore the unit footprint is tiny in comparison! No problems with wireless. I don't use any of the special features so this review cannot address "power user" requirements.
5,Excellent
4,A little awkward as it slants down but I like the it besides of the slanted base.
3,As the title says the keyboard is a battery killer the mouse is a great one I would recommend buy just the mouse (with the dongle) and choose another keyboard. KB It 's very comfortable but It was not for a software developer/coder like me. That's why I've rated 3 stars.
4,Good keyboard but prefer older version that had numbers pad attached.  Also more down angle on older versions than this one.
1,Great keyboard and mouse and I have two.  However the one purchased from Amazon started failing after a few months.  Some keys do not cause letters to happen in apps.  Sometimes touching a key will make that letter be entered hundreds of times until some intervention happens to stop it. After 7 months of use the left space bar started clicking loudly and often causes nothing to happen.  Microsoft web site indicates that if a product is from a source other than Microsoft store you must contact that source for a return.  Amazon gives no way to ask for a return of this item.  Total rip off.  The one year warranty is honored by no one.  Shame on Amazon for selling a product under these circumstances.
4,Not a huge fan of the laptop style keys for the DEL INS PG UP etc keys otherwise a big fan of this combo.
1,This product is infuriatingly fragile so please don't waste your money on it like I did. Not only do Microsoft and Amazon both say to talk to the other when an issue arises with it (leaving one in a customer service infinite loop) but each of the pieces are irreplaceable. So if you damage ANY of its multiple pieces then you'll have to buy an entirely new keyboard.I feel scammed by this product and hopefully by reading my experience you won't be.
5,Since I am using this product to type this review I love it!  I can use it across the room from the computer and not have lag.  Thanks!
4,LIke! But some buttons are not very  comfortable.
3,The keyboard build is fantastic. The mouse is horrible. The typing experience is just not for me. Das Keyboard 4 Professional is far superior in typing. This one is just looking fancy but you miss keys all the times even after two weeks of use. Just not it for me. Maybe you have to have bigger hands.
1,UPDATE:I've had three of these over the years (at two different jobs and one personal one) and all of them developed failures at some point. On the last one the mousewheel stopped working which is really annoying. Microsoft makes it a huge pain to get a warranty replacement - you literally have to write them a letter ("or visit microsoft.com"... which leads you to the document telling you to write them a letter or visit microsoft.com).ORIGINAL REVIEW:Overall a pretty good keyboard with some annoying flaws.The good:- Slick quiet very comfortable to type on.- Ergonomically it is excellent I think.The bad:- Nonstandard layout of the delete/insert/home etc. keys. I found this really annoying - I use these keys quite a bit and this has definitely reduced my productivity.- Sticky function keys. This doesn't happen too often though so it's not that big a deal.
5,The feel of this keyboard is top notch and the mouse oddly enough really works.  The bluetooth seemed to not agree with a few things in my setup so I had to move the receiver closer to the devices but after that it's been working a treat.
4,the number pad works great but please be aware that it needs one CR 2430 battery while mouse needs two AA and keyboard needs two AAA. It's annoying for me to keep three different types of batteries in my cube just for this set of mouse/keyboard/number pad.
1,I LOVE the feel of this keyboard and mouse and I wanted it to work so badly.  Unfortunately it is not a good product.  I ordered one and the mouse and number pad worked great but the keyboard was glitchy.  Some of the keys didn't work at all and some of them stuck.  As I said I loved the feel of it so I returned the first one and requested a replacement in the hopes that it was just a fluke.  No such luck.  The second one I got did the same thing with the keyboard (but different keys) and the mouse was jumpy.  I returned that one as well.
4,Strange to start with but it really help my wrist.
5,While this keyboard and mouse may look a little awkward - it actually functions really well.  The mouse is very large - but very comfortable.  The keyboard will take a day of adjusting - but after that is much more comfortable than a standard keyboard.  The use of magnets for removable parts is also very clever.  Highly recommended.
5,Love it. Replaced my tired but beloved M4000 Ergo keyboard. Much better but you have to get used to where all the other buttons are located. Mouse is great too.
5,The best thing ever. No more wrist pain. I tell everyone who comes to my office what a big difference it has made. I even pack up and take when having to work out of town.
5,This is my 3rd time purchasing this keyboard. It is very easy to use and typing is fun using this keyboard.
4,I don't like having a separate numbers keypad. Other than that it is truly ergonomic.
1,Was great when it stopped working only six months after receiving. Product support website linked from Amazon doesn’t work and tech support isn’t supported on phone. What a joke
5,I use this at work and it is great. I really like that the number keypad is separate
4,It's great!  Luv the key board as well as the mouse Hand does not cramp as much.
4,It suits all my needs and it's a must have device for all developers with the natural typing skills and also ease to use other keyboards as you get praised with this keyboard.
5,This keyboard 10 keypad and mouse combo not only works great it also saves space and is soft and comfortable to use. A tad pricey but worth the money in my opinion.
5,Excellent product and performance but the USB receiver stop working 2 months after purchase resulting in a very bad experience based on the price paid.Can any provide the Microsoft contact number to apply warranty?
3,This is great feeling with arthritic hands but it broke after 7 months of use.
2,I want to love this so badly - I've used this keyboard on other people's computers and loved them. I got this a couple weeks ago unwrapped it then headed out of town for two weeks. No one touched my keyboard or desk... but I come back and now the keyboard is acting like I am pressing the HOME/Windows button. It's. Driving. Me. Crazy. I replaced the batteries resynched the keyboard everything... NOTHING helps. It comes and goes and I cannot handle it!
3,This was a really good deal but I later realized that the right space button sticks a bit. This is an inconvenience I can live with and overall I am content with the purchase.
4,Had some connection issues w/ the mouse and the keyboard seems to not register key presses sometimes. I think that is likely because of my wireless headset receiver being close though.
4,Love the set but occasionally disconnects requiring either a USB jump or reboot.
3,Excellent keyboard and mouse. However had to order it 3 times as the built quality does not seem really good. The mouse scroll wheel was a bit stuck on the first and some keys made noise on the second. Third time around the mouse scroll wheel is not perfectly smooth but don't care anymore as the keyboard is nice!
5,very comfortable  to use very good price and great quality
3,The mouse and keyboard are phenomenal I have gone through two though because the USB always malfunctions. I am so upset and cannot afford to go through another one.
5,Love this BUT the USB key to both mouse and keyboard got squished in my brief case and I need to get a replacement USB key.  Does anyone know if I can order one where and how?
1,I have had this keyboard for a little over a year now and it no longer works. Honestly it's ridiculous. The number keypad has always given me issues. Sometimes it doesn't pick up the numbers I am typing and other times it works just fine. It's very annoying since I use it for work Monday through Friday. The keyboard is now doing the same thing. I have to purchase a new keyboard again after just one year of use. And I have already changed the batteries on it twice. Will not repurchase.
5,Love it.  Don’t use the numeric key pad so I can put it away and have more room on my desk.  Mouse is also great.
3,The design takes some getting use to but it is a more natural position for your hands. I have discovered over time that you have to press hard on the keys or it will skip letters words. I still like to rest my hands in the position but the skipping can be annoying.
2,Keyboard started to go crazy about 1 year ago. It will repeatedly type the letter that was most recently pressed on. unplugging and replugging receiver takes care of the issue temporarily before it comes back a few days later.Now it stops responding as soon as I put it my password to log into windows. Mouse still working fine just the keyboard.
5,Love this keyboard.  I came from an older ergo keyboard and after a few days of using it I'm right back to my comfort zone. The separate number pad is great as it stashes nicely underneath the keyboard when not in use.  The mouse looks obscene but is deceptively comfortable.
4,I love this key board.  The mouse does not seem to work too well.
5,Best keyboard ever. Connectivity is great. Battery life has been good so far. The spacebar is a bit loud but I could be crazy. Buy this.
1,The keyboard is great. I love the separate number pad. The mouse is a wreck. The battery cover won't stay on for anything. Every time I move the mouse it falls off and I end up hitting it around my desk. Very poor design and irritating to work with.
5,My old split keyboard & mouse finally failed.  Took a little while to get used to this keyboard as with any new piece of technology but the learning curve was fast and well worth it.  Great touch to the keyboard.  Mouse is fluid.  Separate keypad is a big bonus.  Would definitely buy again.
5,I my quest to create an ergonomic office environment at home I ordered this keyboard.  I am very pleased and really like the wrist support.  I use the Anker vertical mouse but I am sure the Microsoft mouse that comes with this keyboard is great too.
4,Great keyboard so far love the feel of the keys and ease of typing on it.  The mouse is taking some getting used to - especially for precision editing but overall a great combo.
5,I bought it because of a wrist and forearm pain that was getting quite alarming. The keyboard and mouse greatly mitigated the symptoms in few days and got me back to normal work hours in a week or so.
1,I purchased this product and got it yesterday.  When I opened the box it looked like it was already opened previously and used.  There were stains on the keyboard and smudges on the mouse what looked like fingerprints.  I had to wipe the entire thing first.  Also the packaging inside was not like what you would expect in a new box.  Lastly the give away was that the batteries were already installed and the mouse was already set to on position.  This was the big give away.  Not sure now if I should send it back or keep it.
2,Bought this for when my main computer goes out of service to use my phone as a backup. No dice--it seems only capable of connecting to the Dongle it came with. Therefore does not serve the purpose.Also irritated with the position of the keys relative to the old Microsoft Natural. This is a minor beef just a preference.It does work admirably well however and is nicely portable and wireless.
5,80% of my job is typing plus I'm a full-time student. This keyboard was a relaxing change than the laptop my office provides. I saw in stores and liked it but hated the $125 price. Once I saw it on Amazon for this amazing price I bought it and have not regretted this purchase at all. Highly recommended.
4,Pretty good keyboard!  and uses less space as well!
4,I am ambidextrous with the 10 key so this has been super helpful. One wish is that the wrist rest portion was easier to clean.
2,This had been my favorite wish list from the beginning of this year. I really like computer keyboard and also I am using my computers for my researches. Most of my keyboards was less than $30 expect for mac keyboard. In this manner this keyboard had a huge of attractions for me since it made me have a strong willing to pay.Even though I bought this around $65 I cannot say this is perfect with the price. Key feeling is not bad but my mac keyboard is better. Of course you have to be accustomed yourself for this weird design keyboard whenever you have a tying.
5,I purchased this for my work computer.  It is holding up great to long hours of daily usage.  The mouse is very comfortable even though its shape is quite different to any mouse I have previously used.  The separate number pad allows my to set it out of the way until needed.
2,I've had this just short of 1 year. when it worked it was a great keyboard and I love the mouse.Started having trouble with it connecting a couple of weeks ago. Now it won't connect. I get a USB device not recognizedwhen I plug in the dongle and there is no way to get a replacement dongle.Avoid this if you don't like buying a new keyboard every year
3,Got this because i was interested in the mouse.  Like the mouse only wish it was actually bigger.  I actually do like the shape of it but have bigger hands - hence why I would have liked a slightly bigger mouse.Well built piece of hardware what you would expect of MS hardware.  Solid.
5,Working at home. I love this keyboard & mouse.
1,Did not come with a mouse.
2,The ergonomics are great but the keyboard is constantly missing key strokes and likes to randomly stop working for several seconds at a time. Changing the batteries doesn't fix the issue. Some of the keys randomly jam and do not depress correctly. I have to fiddle with the keys to get them to work again. I keep my work area clean so I know it's not food crumbs and debris causing the issue.This would be an awesome keyboard if it didn't constantly miss key strokes and stop working randomly.
5,This keyboard has change my life .. My hands no longer hurt at the end of the day!!!
4,So far so good. Like the layout and curve. Except for the ESC key. It's a bit hard to press correctly (take one star out)
3,Great keyboard. I own several. One broke within the first year of use. I called and they are replacing it but it is still a PITA.
4,it does what it says it does in their description and still working just fine.
3,You cannot ever replace the dongle on this keyboard. If you break it you have to get a new one.
4,Only one issue no way of knowing if the caps lock is on... especially irritating when you are doing passwords.
4,I like this keyboard except that the number pad doesn't always communicate or work. So that get's a little frustrating.  Overall a cool keyboard and mouse.
5,Very pleased with this keyboard-  Not the Mouse.  The keyboard is available separately for less.  One neat plus is that the number pad has a button to bring up the calculator and you can use the number pad like a calculator in your hand.  Well made keyboard small sized without the keypad.
4,Extremely comfortable to use.  Only issue is that each piece takes a different type of battery.
5,Love this keyboard. It has really helped my wrists. After spending all day typing I was starting to get a lot of pain. Its gone away since I started using this.
5,I work at home and get wrist pain from a conventional keyboard. This one is ergonomic small and light. Easy to put on your lap and then snap back into the desk support with the magnetic connectors. Having the numeric keypad separate is a little weird but worth it to not have it part of the keyboard.
5,The keyboard is very light easy to use extremely comfortable super easy to assemble wrist rest. Being a left handed person having the number pad separated from the key board is simply great. The mouse fits well in the hands. Absolutely love it!
3,Very comfortable but they do NOT have replacement parts. If your USB gets lost or damaged you have to buy everything all over again!
3,Good comfort however the response isn't ideal when connected. Have to hit the letters multiple times to get it to register. Makes it so I have to peck at the letters instead of typing.
3,Mouse broke
5,I love love love this mouse and keyboard. I have it at work and at home. The ergonomic features make it extremely comfortable to use. I have had surgery for carpal tunnel on both wrists in the past caused in part by working on a computer without ergonomic features. Yay!
5,What a incredible product from MS it just fell so good to use their product.
1,Extremely dissatisfied. The letter "G" keeps popping off Everytime I press it. I am so angry. I just paid a lot of money for this keyboard set. I type fast and to have to stop turn my keyboard over remove the battery press the button back in replace the batteries etc. and retrace my thoughts is beyond frustrating annoying you name it!This is my 3rd Microsoft Sculpt Erogonomic keyboard and the first time I've had this problem. Disappointment doesn't cover the what I want to say. I've always spoken highly about this product.
5,I enjoy using this setup so much that I have it on both my work and my home systems. Very little mouse lag and no noticeable lagging on the keyboard. Have not had any issues using it with Windows or Linux. Would likely buy one again.
5,I purchased  this for my wife to bring to work. She has bad tendonitis in her right wrist.  Although not a cure this does help her very much and she has less pain on most days.  Easy to setup as well.
5,Love love love love love. I am not used to typing on ergonomic keyboards and have tried in the past but they all felt so foreign. This is a great keyboard that is simile to adapt to and great on my hands and wrists. Plus the detached calculator is so cool!
2,It's been about 18 months now and I believe this has issues. Not sure if the frequency has interference from my wireless router or what is causing the wireless connection to fail. It is easily fixed by bumping the dongle however in typing this review it has failed 3-4 times. This is annoying. I have tried replacing all batteries multiple times. After reading reviews it appears this seems to be a common theme. I do like the set and want it to work properly so I am half tempted to order another new set.
3,We bought three of these keyboard sets for office use. We thought they were amazing it is a very nice setup. Unfortunately after less than six months two of them are intermittently unresponsive.
5,I love this item makes working at home sooooo much easier!
1,It's 2018. Why isn't this backlit? do i need to buy hololens to project led light on this in augmented reality?! cmon MS logitech kicked your butt on this keyboard in 2012. This should be lithium rechargeable and backlit. get with it.I came back after a month or so to drop a star. This is unusable with Mac! The mouse drops-out in the same desktop configuration as my Surface - which works fine. Brand-new top of the line Mac nope. Horrible. returning. DOES NOT WORK. This is not a mouse and keyboard this is a product that specifically does not work with Apple products. Keyboard is a universal thing. This is a proprietary product not a universal solution.
5,and saw this and decided to try it. takes up less room is lighter weight and I like the freedom of configuration of the separate number key pad. The mouse is higher than a regular mouse so your hand is less flat...took a bit of getting used to but now find it quite comfortable.
5,Love this keyboard but they die (or i kill them) too fast.
5,I'm a contractor and needed to buy my own keyboard for work. I was skeptical because of the disconnected keypad. Turns out I love it! Bought a second one for my home office.
5,love this keyboard... the old apple bluetooth board was killing my pinkies/wrists... pain gone within a week of switching to this thing!well done
5,My wrists stop hurting took a few days to get use to an ergo keyboard but I really like it. You yea you should get one.
5,It took a little while to get used to but I really like the short draw of the keys and the layout forces me to type at least closer to correctly.  The mouse may be my favorite part as I have very large hands and it fits better than any other mouse I've ever had.
1,I have gone through two of these KB/Mouse.  First one the mouse button just became flaky.  Second one the keyboard started to die after 3 months.  Absolutely lowest reliability kb/mouse I have even had.  Logitech I have had lasted 6~7 years and I replaced it mostly because it just wore out.
5,Good layout. Nice responsive keys. Separate number keypad.
4,Works well very lightweight and comfortable to use.  Love it.
5,This is my favorite ergonomic keyboard. The mouse is great as well. It could be improved if it were Bluetooth enabled instead of using the USB connection. But it's still a great product.
5,I like the feel of the keyboard.  The detached keypad allows me to make better use of space on a small keyboard return.  My only issue is with the plate on the bottom of the mouse which does not snap into place as well as I would like.  It has fallen out twice.
5,Very comfortable easy to adjust to! The pain in my wrists has gone down significantly since purchasing this keyboard. I have a very hard time using flat keyboards now that I've adjusted to this. Great for people who have repetitive motion syndrome or carpal tunnel.Would purchase again!
5,The best keyboard I've ever used. The mouse is something to get used to but I'll never go back to another keyboard. It felt very natural and completely neutral on my wrists. Key action is sensitive and responsive I don't mind the laptop-type keys at all.
5,After trying a few wireless keyboards/mice without dongles I went back to this.  It is nice in that it is not jittery and does not cut out or pause.  To me this is the most important thing.  The Windows 8 gestures and programmable keys are great too.
5,Like the compact configuration. Has significantly reduced my wrist pain.  Still getting use to the mouse.  Wish I could purchased without the separate numbers pad.
5,Increased transcription production.  Exceptionally light keystrokes lessening hand/digit fatigue even on long shifts.  Detached number pad allows extra room on keyboard tray.  Ergonomic mouse fits comfortably.  Have transcribed with several other ergonomic keyboards over the years and this one is the best by far.  Thanks Microsoft for an outstanding product!
5,I really do like this set up.  About Ten years ago I developed severe pain in each wrist from using laptop keyboard.  This took care of that problem.
5,I love it especially the mouse. Feels great and noticeable compared to typical keyboards.
4,The only issue with this keyboard is USB dongle it is long and if you break it you will throw the keyboard.
5,Excellent keyboard and mouse.  It’s very comfortable for long periods of use I use this go for work.
5,I love this keyboard so much that I bought 2 more!  The mouse however is fairly useless.  I no longer mouse right-handed due to wrist problems but this mouse cannot be used effectively left-handed.  Plus it is simply too large to be used by someone with small hands (I.e most women)
1,Poor quality and lacks the ability to rebind devices to the dongles.The mice die far too quickly for any electronic product.  With the buttons giving multiple clicks after 6-12 months of use.  And once the mouse dies you can't just bind another to the same dongle you are stuck with having another even though the mouse is the exact same product.And say you want to register your product with microsoft so you can maybe get support.  The support page you get will direct you to a registration page that doesn't exist and once you find the real registration page it just fails to load anything once you click submit.
5,Purchased for use at work. Once you get used to to the ergonomic shape it feels great!
1,If I could give this keyboard 0 stars I would.  It worked great for the first couple of months.  Now it randoms chooses when the keyboard will or won't work.  I could be typing along and missing letters or whole words as they keys I press don't register.  I thought maybe this was a battery issue so I bought brand new batteries to try to fix it but nothing is helping.  Sometimes it works and other times it doesn't.  I love the feel and shape of the keyboard if it would just work I'd love it.  Seems as though it's an issue with the wireless.  Ugh!  Any one else having this problem? Is there a fix?  Sounds like I'll have to buy a new keyboard.Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop (L5V-00001) keys on keyboard not working!
1,This project works so well for me and my wrists I have bought it three different times. Unfortunately the USB connection is poor and gave out in less than a year. After hours of trying to get support they told me that you cannot buy a replacement USB and instead need to buy the whole set again. It feels so wasteful to keep buying new sets and so frustrating to have such low quality that I cannot bring myself to replace it yet again even if my wrists ask for it. I expected more from MS.
1,The unfortunate thing is this was a spare we had ordered awhile ago so did not realize it was busted or even that it was not even new and now cant return it. I just looked closer at the box after the user said it didnt work. On the the side there is a stickert that says "amazon inspected". I dont know if "inspecting" is just making sure the parts are there or what but it isnt actually testing to see if it works. The usb dongle looks bent and fell apart when i pulled it out of the users usb port. Thanks Amazon!
3,the keys are flat and since I have slightly long nails it my fingers slip.  My old keyboard had indentations and I had no problem.  /the pluses are that it is ergonomic and wireless.
1,Way too expensive for the 3 weeks it lasted.
5,I use this product for work. It's amazingly comfortable.
4,Works great !! Need some getting used to in the beginning but after that it works like a champ.  I would recommend to all my friends.
3,Loved it till it starting typing q all across the page and I couldn't stop it.  Had to take the batteries out and even after a reset it would only work for a bit then malfunction.  Sent it back.
5,I just use this mouse / keyboard for work but it's great.
5,Love this keyboard. It’s practically silent while typing. It’s light weight and comes with batteries. Highly recommend.
3,The keyboard is great but the mouse does not seem to be ergonomic at all.My right hand actually started to ache because of the mouse.
5,Key travel and ergonomics are great! Using at work for a year or two now.
5,Absolutely worth the extra $$$ to upgrade to the Sculpt. I was hesitant at first thinking that a keyboard is a keyboard is a keyboard. How wrong I was...This little beauty makes sweet sultry love to your fingertips and will keep you up and writing all...night...long. Awwww yeah.
2,I loved the keyboard until it quit working. I bought it for work and use it everyday for clerical/data entry. Last Friday (04/12/2019) it quit working. Tried swapping brand new batteries and it still wouldn’t work. Had it lasted at least a year I may have had a better review. Unfortunately now I need to buy a new one.
4,The mouse is not very precisely pointed on 1080P. Keyboard is great. Have used the previous 2 generations of ergonomic set from Microsoft. And this one is also great.
1,My fault in this was not removing the usb dongle before moving my laptop but having said that I think it is absolutely ridiculous that if you damage your usb receiver this is now trash. the whole set is trash. they made these so that they are "uniquely paired" and now i have a bunch of plastic and electronic waste because a tiny little usb got bumped. Maybe design your products better so that the smallest most delicate part of your whole product isn't irreplaceable? Oh and I called and it they have not redesigned this product at all. New versions are still like this.
5,Love this keyboard and mouse setup more than any other I've used in the past 20 years. The keys have great tactile feedback and quick response tims and the ergonomic feature is fantastic!
5,Best Windows keyboard setup I ever had.  Have not had any key skips or interrupts which can be a problem for USB input devices like this.
5,Comfortable for my wrists. Mouse to small but I have very large hands.
1,I bought this keyboard for office work purposes which was a very nice experience while it lasted. Fast forward 6 months the keyboard no longer works even after troubleshooting and trying it with my other laptops in the household.Considering Microsoft claims a 3 years warranty on this product after contacting Microsoft Customer Support I was informed that I'd have to pay shipping to them and then they would be able to inspect the validity of my claim.Now $75 for a "premium" keyboard that breaks after 6 months is expensive enough but now they want me to pay an extra fee for their own underdelivering of a product?Stay away I don't think this keyboard is worth the price for 6 months use and headaches to find a new one so soon after.
5,My all time favorite keyboard. You hands are able to relax on the ergonomic design. It takes some time to get used to the positioning if keys however it's not much and it's definitely worth it!
5,Excellent design for someone who types 8 hours a day.  The mouse is worth the price alone.  Would buy again.
5,Nice tactile "feel."  Right keypad being separate takes a little time to get used to.  Fkeys could be a little larger.  Mouse is okay.  The back button on the mouse is positioned a little differently than the back button on Logitech mice.
2,This breaks so easily-design flaw in the dongel which apparently can not be replaced when damaged-recommend a different product with smaller or no dongle. Like the design and function when it does work
5,Great ergonomic keyboard. Easy set up and sturdy. Very reliable so far. Very happy with it.
1,I was happy with the keyboard and mouse -- but Keyboard Stopped working after 80 days but Amazon would not accept return so I am trying to get return or repair from Microsoft. I am not happy today but if they can give me brand new one that works for a few years they will make me happy. Otherwise I will give them another bad review next week.
5,This item was ordered for a co-worker.  To my knowledge she is satisfied with the product.  In fact I just ordered another one today for another co-worker.  It is a good value as well.
1,At the beginning it worked fine but after a couple of years the keyboard drains the batteries in a couple of weeks. I searched the Web and tried to troubleshoot by seeing if it was a stuck key but no positive results. I have to take the batteries off every day and put them back in the morning and there is no way to switch the keyboard off either.
5,The keyboard looks weird at first but is fantastic after using it. Plus love the wireless 10 key. Mouse is super comfortable.
5,Second one that I bought. I like the curved and can use them well. Others using my computer do not like the feel but that is because they won't give them a try.
5,Works well for me once I got used to the unattached number pad. Best keyboard I have used.
3,I've have a couple because I love the detached number pad but it never seems to last a year.  Luckily Microsoft replaces them.
2,I got this 4 months ago and it stopped working out of the blue the second month. It seems it is a problem with the USB receiver. I tried getting a new receiver but it seems it won't work so in order to fix the issue I will have to pay $80+ to get a complete new set.The keyboard is great but the usb receiver issue makes it a bad purchase.
5,As usual fast shipping provided by Amazon.  I am extremely happy with the Microsoft Sculpt Ergononic Desktop set.  No problem in getting used to it.  I appreciate the size on my desktop it is much smaller than most other ergonomic keyboards and mice.
2,Keyboard itself is one of better 'ergonomic' designs. But I had to literally throw it the set  a) Does not have full compatibility with mac and b) the 'dongle'  broke almost immediately primarily due to poor design and if I remember correctly costs $100 to replace. In short  the set was worthless to me as a mac user. By contrast Logictech mouse dongle I've been using for some years has never broken or needed to be replaced.
4,We all like keyboard except the battery runs is used up pretty quickly...any suggestions on how batteries may last longer?
2,Microsoft has not updated the transmitter to make it shorter but did not give a refund for broken transmitters. This is my second microsoft keyboard ill be ordering. Maybe 3 is the charm but I know this is my last time for trialing. I havent kept one of their wireless keyboards for over a year to-date.
3,i like this keyboard but after only 3 months the shift key on the left side has stopped working.  Same thing happened with my previous Sculpt keyboard after 6 months.
5,I received one of these at work and loved it so I decided to buy one for home.  No complaints.
5,Love the keyboard!
5,People tell me that I’m hard on my keyboards. I own theee if these and all theee have healed up well to my aggressive typing.
4,They keyboard is excellent I love it.  Very comfortable to use.The mouse is an abomination though.  Wish I could buy just the keyboard.
5,I'm using ergonomic keyboards for over 15 years and current model is the best!Can't imagine on using anything else.
5,love it! The keys on the keyboard are very similar to the ones on my Macbook pro. The mouse is great. The size of the keyboard is way better than the older version. It is less bulky yet ergonomic.
2,The design of the mouse and keyboard are great.I currently own three of these sets two in my home office and one at work. The problem is that they keep loosing connection. I just had my second keyboard go out in less than a year and third since I started using this set in 2018. I cannot continue to use a product as unreliable as this.
5,Unfortunately mouse rubber getting wear off to quick...But it is still very good product.
5,Takes a bit of getting used to  I love that its light weight and small. Works great if you do a lot of 10 keying. I would highly recommend this to anybody!
4,The keyboard took a little getting used to but I now love it!  I would have preferred a mouse for lefties.
5,This keyboard is super comfortable to use and dramatically reduces the risk of RSI
5,I love this keyboard. The buttons have just the right feel and clack. The mouse has a great feel although my first ergonomic mouse took some getting used to. Now it is weird for normal and prefer this one.
5,Awesome ergo keyboard and mouse.
4,The department that requested them have positive things to say about it.  So great product and arrived pretty quickly.
2,Design is  comfortable functionality not so much.  The "W" key sticks a couple of other keys don't consistently work well and you have no way of know if the caps lock is on for password - The mouse quit working consistently after only one year old - Would NEVER buy again
5,This is my third order for this keyboard/mouse combo.  I ordered one for the office about six months ago and was so impressed that I ordered two more for the house.  This is the highest quality wireless ergonomic keyboard and mouse that I have used.
3,Mouse is very uncomfortable and caused me hand pain
4,Works well and looks very stylish but the wrist pad gets dirt/faded fast
5,Everything needed was provided and the ONE dongle works keyboard 10-key and mouse.
5,Its soo much more comfortable than my last. the mouse has some weight to it which I oddly find to be easier to use.
5,This is money well spent. I have not had any more risk pain. And I love the mouse that comes with it. The entire set up is Awesome! you can't go wrong with this investment.
5,i am a happy customer... I wish it two bunddles instead of one.... i guess i am asking too much...
5,Love this keyboard!Very comfertable but does have a small learning curve.Excellent for people who types a lot or spend a lot of time in front of a computer.
5,My husband uses a computer 8 hours a day! His wrists had really been hurting him and starting to feel numb. Every since he bought this his wrists have been feeling great and he hasn't had any problems!! Highly Recommend!
5,Ergo mouse and keyboard excellent construction and all components came with batteries so ready to use right out of the box.Very well constructed and I would highly recommend.
5,I'd been using this keyboard and mouse combo for years.  When I got a new job I bought a new set to replace the basic keyboard/mouse combo the company provided.
2,I was really looking forward to getting this desktop setup but one of the keys popped off within half-an-hour after un-boxing. Also some of the keys did not register so I had to return the product. The keyboard is aesthetically pleasing; however if there is no functionality this kind of defeats the purpose. The previous incarnation of this keyboard was great and I used it for about three years with no problems.
4,The keyboard and mouse is good but only gripe is with the "Esc" key. It is too small (since I use Vim a lot)
4,Just needed the 10-key but it's not sold individually by this brand. Overall good product do get much use for the other items though.
2,I am a software developer and have used this keyboard for a month. The keys started to fail (I dont slam them) and no matter what I did (macro other keys to mimic the failed keys the keyboard is now rendered useless.Save your money for a mechanical keyboard because these keys cannot be 'popped off' and cleaned. If you pop them off they do not sit properly when you snap it back on.Total waste.Comfy design. Was nice while it lasted for a month of work.
4,Really like it. Would give it 5 stars if the function keys were larger.
5,Works well. Nice tactile feel from the keys. I have had mine for two years for my home office and just bought another to take to my work office.
3,Plunge depth is too shallow.  Travel distance for right pinky is way out of whack. No drivers for OSX. It does look amazing on my desk though.Microsoft should have kept the option on the Natural keyboard.  They shouldn't have broken what didn't need to be fixed.
5,The best ergonomic keyboard I have used and very affordable. The keystrokes are responsive not mushy. A big plus is the separation of the number keypad which makes the main keyboard have a much smaller footprint. It is important for programmers.The mouse is OK. Quite comfortable.
5,Best keyboard/mouse there is.  Worth getting.  I've been using it for years at work and finally got me this set for home.  Worth every penny.
2,Mixed review -- most comfortable keyboard and mouse I've ever used even better than the old Microsoft ergonomic desktop and takes up less space.  But it does not hold up well.  After about two years of light to moderate use several of the keys stopped working others have almost failed and the mouse wheel doesn't work with a lot of applications.  I'll probably buy another one since it's easy on my hands but really for an expensive keyboard it should hold up better than this.
1,I bought this for work and it is absolutely terrible. The mouse glitches out and skips around. The keyboard keys get stuck. Wasted $100 on this setup that doesnt work. Don't buy microsoft
1,Was not labeled as used and this item is clearly used. Returning.
5,I've had for 5 years and it still works great.
5,Love it. Works amazing. Took a bit to get used to
4,The keyboard ROCKS but the mouse was awkward and hurt my wrist
1,First bought one of these back in 2016. That one still works fine. Decided to get another for a new office I work out of. Bought it in Nov 2019. Appx 8 mo in there's an issue with the mouse's left click. If you check the reviews for Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Mouse (L6V-00001) you'll see plenty of complaints about the same. Also sounds like a major hassle getting Microsoft to honor their warranty but I'll try.
3,I loved this keyboard for 15 months until the connector stopped working.  It should have lasted longer.
4,I like the old natural 7000 keyboard/mouse better but this combo works just fine.  Keyboard has much smaller footprint and a modern look.
3,Like the keyboard but not the wonky unpredictable mouse. I tried but finally gave up using the mouse. It isn't accurate and would sometime fail to function totally.
5,Most comfortable Keyboard I have ever used. I came form a Microsoft ergonomic keyboard and this is even better. Especially the ergonomic mouse.. Its awesome
4,works good but not as nice as its predecessor
5,I like this keyboard a lot. I like that I don’t have all these wires everywhere and the shape.
3,L key pops out while typing
5,For Office Use. Very convenient to use
1,Product never worked out of the box.  Microsoft couldn’t solve connect issues.  Product looked used when I purchased new.  Shady.
5,Super comforable keyboard and mouse takes some getting used to but much better for your wrists.
5,I loved this keyboard! Super lightweight soft touch keys. Would definitely reccomend!
1,Stay away from this keyboard.  This is one of the worst keyboard and mouse purchases I have ever made.  I had high hopes for this but I tell you after several months of use I am finally giving up.  The keyboard feels good but many times I have to hit a key several times before the character will appear.  As for the mouse it is rough lacking the accuracy of other mice meaning it takes too much effort to align the cursor with what you are trying to do.  The split key board with the numeric pad was a mistake.  A waste of money.
5,Fits on under-the-table pull-out shelves perfectly whereas the older Microsoft ergonomics do not. I type mental health progress notes all day every day and my wrists never get sore.
4,This keyboard is comfortable and the keys respond really well. The keys are fun to press and makes my job a lot easier.
5,Pricy but very worth it. I'm loving everything about it after several months of use.  No issues with battery consumption (mentioned in other reviews).
5,Great wireless desktop!  Purchased for employee at office.  She loves!
5,I love this keyboard.  It has a great feel and was made to feel like a super high quality unit.  The mouse is the best I've ever used.  I didn't think I'd like this setup as much as I do now.
4,Unfortunately the hand pad and mouse are not as large as expected(long hands) i guess some things are just build for small people.
5,Works well and is easy to type on. The mouse has a nice large size that fits my hand very well. The only complaint I can come up with is that the keyboard doesn't have an off switch and the caps lock doesn't have an indicator.
2,The ergonomics are great but occasionally the mouse connection gets spotty and the cursor position jumps all over the screen. I don't know if the mouse has to be right up against the receiver for a proper signal or what but this performance significantly downgrades the product in my eyes.
5,Ordered it for work as I did not like the stock Dell keyboard we use. Loved it so much ordered one for Home as well! Quiet comfortable and the interface is a smooth transition for laptop users already accustomed to smaller  keys. Home run here.
2,Don’t buy this unless you want a hunk of junk just laying around. The USB toggle WILL go bad and it’s not replaceable without replacing the whole unit. Mine lasted all of 3 months before it finally crapped out and Microsoft was no help!
4,The mouse is fantastic. The keyboard is taking time for me getting use to lay my hand on but it's really good.
1,Straight to the point..this is not a good product. You will start to experience the following soon:1. It all just stops working2. Delayed response to keyboard3. Keys stickingAt first you think it is the batteries and you replace them all then 2 week later the symptoms return.Then you figure it can't be the batteries and you play with the USB Receiver. It starts to work again for a few days and it starts all over again.I wish I could return this item but it takes a while for the issues to really manifest. After 2 months this product is absolutely unreliable.
2,I really wanted to like this keyboard as I am a pretty big fan of the previous version.  Within 5 minutes of taking this out of the box you can feel that the left side is shorter (a-key to end of padding).  As a result my left palm rests on the un-padded edge it drove me crazy instantly.  I tried a couple pads but they were pretty awkward.  I should say the design looks great and if you have tiny hands this might not bug you. This is going back very lame.
5,well designed product that not only helps with the user relieve wrist discomfort from using the keyboard to frequently. it's design is also pleasing to the eye.
1,I ultimately had to send this keyboard back.  Twice.  The keyboard was great except in both cases keys did not function properly.  On the first keyboard the F5 key would get stuck costing me valuable time prying it back loose after I diagnosed the problem.  On the second keyboard the question mark key required too much pressure to trigger and was not usable in my normal keyboarding rhythm.Other than that the product was actually quite nice.  The mouse size was great and it slid across my desk much smoother than my current Microsoft Mouse 5000. The keyboard and mouse were both held together by magnets making batter access simple.  The keys felt great and I enjoy the chiclet style keys.  I wish the keyboard had worked so I could have kept it.
5,The keyboard is awesome. I love it. Keys are very responsive and the feel of the board is exactly what I needed. The mouse is good but not excellent.
3,Not a fan of the function keys and some of the keys are over stretched causing you to consistently press the wrong key.
4,Very comfortable to use. The only thing is that it does not work well with USB 3.0 USB hub.
1,The product could be described as 'prissy'. I need a man sized key board.  I need large keys. The keys are small compared to earlier versions. The whole key board is smaller. The little plastic stand that makes the key board stand taller comes off when the key board is moved on the desk. It is held on with very weak little magnets.  The keys are like little laptop keys little movement and no tactile feed back. Easy to press the wrong key because there is too little force needed to press a key and make it work. So I get accidental keystrokes.  If you are a man with large hands this is not the one for you. It is designed for appearances. Delicate small prissy.
5,the best keyboard for Touch typing and it saves your wrists.
3,1) The keyboard EATS batteries.  I've had this keyboard for 3 months and I've replaced the batteries 3 times.  Not normal.2) The mouse is pretty bulky.3) The number pad is helpful.4) Love the look and feel though.
2,The function and escape keys are not the same quality as the rest of the keyboard. And also no way to turn it off.  Other than that it is a good ergonomic keyboard.
1,Love it at first except when the dongle USB broke in my laptop bag I wanted to buy another usb receiver however I discovered this is actually not possible each receiver are factory paired to the keyboard and mouse. Now I have a nice mice and keyboard as good as  new but totally useless.  The help center of Microsoft is not helping when you do a search you get and answer that tell you to contact the hardware support however when you follow the link you get to a nice : "This page doesn’t exist.".Then you struggle with the maze to get the proper contact info. I now have to buy a brand new set as it is not under warranty anymore .....Very disappointing.
5,Have been using the keyboard daily love how compact it is and the fact that it is ergonomic (I have arthritis on my hands/wrists).  The key click is muted not noisy an added plus.
5,Love this combo I travel a lot for work and I am able to fit this all in my travel case no problem I hate typing on a laptop keyboard.
5,Using as my daily work keyboard and mouse.  Love especially the mouse responsiveness and the feel of the keys.
5,This is a great set and very comfortable.
4,the battery for the num pad drained out in two days not sure if the battery was defected.
1,Some Keys are dead I really liked it but after 10 months of the purchase key 3 and 4 stopped working so while thing is useless for me now. When you can't use your digits  you can't use it for work.
3,This is a great keyboard and trackball combo or at least it was six months ago at $75. I was looking to get another one for another computer but not sure that I can justify 33% price increase.
1,Do not buy this defective keyboard.  The home button broke after 3 months of normal use which caused the entire keyboard to lock up.  Seller refused to give refund and instead directed me to Microsoft.  Microsoft customer service  kept transferring me from department to department in circles.  This is a scam and seller should be banned for selling on amazon.
5,The keyboard and mouse are terrific! I was having pains in my wrist because I was using a regular keyboard and mouse after start using this combo the back pain and the wrist pain ended. n__n I'm very happy with the ergonomics of the product.
2,The keyboard is great but the numbers pad is terrible.  The numbers work sometimes.  Often I need to hit the same number several times.  In less than 8 months the batter provided is dead.  Not recommended if need to use the number pad.
4,It took some getting used to for the arrow keys but I love how quiet this keyboard is. Totally worth it.
1,The product does not work and I have to pay for a defective product (update 9.11 - I had to pay 55.00 to ship it back). Driver download does not fix the mouse problem or product is defective from vendor. Either way not a good product! And they never contacted me or offer help. This vendor should not be selling on Amazon. Only buy from them if you want to lose money.
5,My boss bought this set and was curious about it so I got one for myself and I was not disappointed it gives a better fit uses less space and the battery lasts longer than with my older set
2,I was very pleased with the keyboard and mouse when I first received it but only three weeks later both the mouth and the keyboard stopped working. I do not know what went wrong I changed all the batteries tested it on different computers I made sure I was using a correct surface for the mouse but nothing worked. Very disappointed in the longevity of the product.
5,I love this setup and I love the weird mouse--perfect for me! Sits on top of my laptop keyboard nicely but occasionally presses the power button at the top right.
5,This keyboard took only few minutes to getting used to the hand position. It is really comfortable for all day computing and texture and ease of pressing key is amazing. I can just place the keyboard on my lab too. I recommend this product.
2,This is the third Microsoft ergonomic keyboard we have purchased.  Two of the three had the number keypad fail and the most recent one had both the number keypad and mouse USB adapter failed within a few months.  I think this is a manufacturer's problem not the seller.
5,It is real easy to type on and the wireless features are great so well.
5,Sooo much easier on my wrists when writing for long periods. Hmm maybe I can find a split-laptop?
5,Love this keyboard and mouse. Took me a week to get comfortable with it but couldn't live without it now.
5,Love this keyboard!  I just wish that it worked better with a MAC computer....but that's more of a cross-brand issue.Everything else I love about it...it seriously is the most comfortable ergo keyboard yet!
3,I like the calculator pad and the mouse but the keyboard is a bit smaller than I like.  I still use it but not on either of my main computer set ups.
5,Arrived as described. Works well. My favorite keyboard number pad mouse set.
4,Other than not having light up keyboard which isn't anything to do with seller love it.
4,As described - works great.
5,I absolutely love this keyboard set.  I have been using it for quite a while without issue.  Very comfortable if you like the ergo set-up - which I do!!
4,Takes some getting used to but I think it will work for me.
5,Was getting wrist and finger pains. Switched to the Sculpt -- and pains are a thing of the past.Highly recommended for the modern day worker.
5,It works nicely. The keyboard is excellent. The mouse is not bad.
5,very comfortable. i like the separate keypad.  the mouse took some getting use to but i love it now.  works great with windows 7 ultimate surely with anything higher as well.
1,Worked great out of the box but within the first day it started freezing intermittently.  Thinking it was something with my computer I spent an afternoon updating drivers software bios etc. etc. trying to troubleshoot the problem.  Narrowed it down to a defective wireless receiver.  When held at a certain angle it works when in its relaxed state doesn't work.Ordered replacement with 2-day Prime shipping on a Monday after 2 days of NOTHING (Amazon sat on the order for 2 days!) I get notice that it will arrive on a Friday.  Why do I pay for Prime??  Get your act together Amazon.
5,I use it for my work and is perfect.
4,working good with mac the only con is the receiver is a bit too big
2,Why not?1. The Escape key and the Function keys are half-height.Their small size makes them difficult to press and they don't have the same feel as the other keys.2. The arrow keys are designed to look good (like the rest of the keyboard) but they aren't easy to use. They aren't in a location that feels natural for the hand.If you use the Escape key or the Function keys or the Arrow keys with any regularity then you will not like this keyboard.
5,Incredible keyboard the best I ever had.The mouse precision is amazing it works even when used on glass surfaces.
1,I've had this keyboard for less than 4 months and it just started dropping keystrokes. I was so surprised. I've never had a keyboard do this before. Then I started researching the issue and find all the reviews that mention the same thing. It's such a shame. I've reached out to Microsoft support and they act like it's the first time they've heard of this issue. It's just very disappointing. I don't know about you but missing keystrokes is about the only thing that is unforgivable in a keyboard - wired or wireless. I can't possibly give this keyboard a higher rating. It's failing on it's primary mission. End of story.
1,I was enjoying my keyboard until the USB receiver went missing. Little did I know it cannot be replaced. Microsoft customer service was NO HELP AT ALL. In fact I waited OVER AN HOUR to try and speak to a supervisor about my options because the first person who spoke very broken English couldn't help me. I finally had to hang up and now I guess my keyboard is useless unless the piece magically reappears. There should be a replacement option for the USB receiver or it should be bluetooth enabled. Do not buy this product! Find something more technologically advanced and user-friendly from a company that actually provides customer service.
2,I've only had this keyboard for 3 months. I love the touch and feel of the keyboard and I truly love the mouse. However the keys on the calculator pad are going out.I can no longer use it if I want accuracy in my numerical figures. I spent the additional money thinking I would get something of quality. Not so.
5,Love this keyboard - starting to glitch and having issues with keys after about a year though. Hoping that the seller will contact me to resolve.
5,Love this keyboard.  It puts your hands in a much more natural position.
5,I bought this after having surgery on my hand due to arthritis. Had a removal of bone and reconstruction with a tendon to hold on my thumb.
5,Love this keyboard! Excellent design no issues with my carpal tunnel. The keys are slim and quiet. Almost like the Apple keyboards. The mouse is my only complaint- too bulky. Overall great buy!
5,I'm a IT Internet programmer (web developer) and computer programmer. I really like it. It is a great keyboard for people who also types fast. My wrist feel so comfortable when I type. It has an amazing and professional look too.
5,Really comfortable! The separate design for main keyboard and numeric keyboard is great. Saved a lot of space and make the position to handle the mouse more comfortable.
4,Great keyboard good quality well designed ergonomic indeed. Horrible mousetoo large and tall pretty much unusable for me.
5,I type all day long for my job and worry about carpal tunnel. My wrists have felt much better using this new ergonomic keyboard and mouse. Very easy to set up and use.
4,Great ergo keyboard and mouse
5,Love this thing...took some getting used to but now it is hard to type on anything else and my wrist-strain has all but disappeared.  Hope it holds up to my non-stop typing all day every day.
2,I like the wireless and like the basic keyboard layout but I hate the small function keys and compressed arrow/accessory keys. That is if you ever use function keys or the ESC keys they're very small. And if you regularly use the arrow keys to scroll through things and the DEL PgUp PgDn Home & End keys for moving/editing they compressed layout is a PAIN. I constantly find myself hitting the wrong key and deleting things I don't mean to. Yuck.
5,I tried this keyboard before I bought it The keyboard is very comfortable and much easier to use than earlier ergonomic keyboards. The calculator / keypad is handy when calculator is needed. Installation was easy and simple - just plug in the dongle.
1,the design of this keyboard is great---BUT  Microsoft support of their product really deserves aMINUS 10--  This is a replacement  and there have been intermittent problems with the wireless..Now the transceiver has fallen apart-- Called them-- basically they said you are SOL..  they have no replacement parts for many of their products-- suggestion I need to buy a different brand....I WILL!!!BTW AMAZON needs to remove a warranty time as 3 years-- Microsoft does not offer ANY warranty on this product...
5,I have already purchased three of them. It's a great keyboard. Good thing is that with one USB dongle you connect the keyboard and mouse. Instead of using two USB when you buy them separately.
1,Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop (L5V-00001) just does NOT cut it for me as key's are to 'short'. The center 'arch' is not as significant as the 7000:(. The separation of the numbers pad  makes no sense to me and by doing so eliminated the oh so valuable 2nd 'enter' key at the far right of the keyboard. The relocation of the delete insert home end pg up/down really *****!Loved the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Desktop 7000 and so sad it's discontinued and only available now for 450.00 and above:(. It was a great great great product. I owned three and the bad news is / was that each died at 3 years (by no accident that is when the warranty ends):(
3,the main keyboard gave out in less a year.
2,ESC and FN "keys" aren't really keys anymore. The wrist rest on the left side is too shallow and the edge bites into your palm. There is no support when you go for the arrow keys. and the Home/End/Page Up/Page Down layout is insane. The mouse is too short and you cannot remap the "windows" button to something else. The outboard 10-key is great and the keys are fine but all these other things kill it. Stick to the Natural 4000. I hope they do not discontinue it.
5,Awesome. Comfortable. Easy to use. Made of Quality Material.
2,Dongle bent after 3 months (exactly two weeks after 90 day warranty expired). Tried to purchase a replacement and was told that I would have to purchase a whole new system as each dongle is uniquely paired to the system. DO NOT BUY! Too fragile!
5,WOW this is a really really nice keyboard.  MUCH nicer than the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic 4000 that it's replacing.  Very pleasantly surprised with this purchase.
1,Darn these kepboard/mouse/keypad.  I own three.  the first one doesn't register the letter or space when hit.  Unreliable.  have to inspect your work constantly.  the mouse jerks.  BUT THE WORSE is the keypad.  it fails many times while entering numbers.  I love the sleek look and the small size. I bought three. The second one in hopes I just got a lemon on the first one.  I am afraid to open the one still in the box.Not a good product and i warn against it.  In a word a pain in the neck.
5,Started using an ergonomic keyboard years ago and my carpel tunnel disappeared.The 10-key and the ergonomic mouse makes it a perfect set up.
5,Excellent keyboard.  Too bad it's not bluetooth though as the little USB phob is bound to get lost someday.
1,HORRENDOUS battery life on the mouse. I've owned this less than 1 month and the red light (battery needs replacing) on the mouse is on AGAIN. FOR. THE. THIRD. TIME.I do not use it for gaming. Only for normal workday use. It is used exclusively on a leather desktop pad so there should be no 'constant optical tracking' as I've read about in various web forums on the topic.Do not buy unless you have an unlimited supply of batteries!!!!!
1,Let's keep this short.  Don't toss out your old keyboard too fast.Pros:Keyboard is great to type on and I do think the angle is slightly improved over my standard Microsoft Ergonomic keyboard which I love and now using again.  Keys are quiet and soft they feel great.  This is coming from a guy who uses the old school MS keyboard Lenovo\IBM laptops with the nice keyboards and latest also enjoy a mac keyboard ok.  The keyboard feels great all aroundCons:A few keys stopped working.  The end that's not gonna work.When it was working not a fan of the separated number pad.  Sure it looks Really cool but after you don't care its a little nuts.
1,Frankly I love the keyboard design very much and the mouse is fine too. The receiver is ugly but that is even acceptable. However the main thing is the receiver is not quality as it's start loosing when plugged into USB port just after 3 months. It's getting worse and now it only works when hold on it. At the beginning I didn't noticed the problem and try different USB port different machines installing the latest drivers for it but it's always randomly stopping working.  I went to Microsoft Support but got frustrated. There is no replacement for the receiver itself. So that I have to buy a new set totally I'd like to try other models. If anybody has any solutions welcome to make comments to let me know.
2,Pretty annoying if the USB stops working then you cannot use any part of this set- no more keyboard mouse or number pad. They do not offer replacements. You have to buy a whole new set. I would suggest spending a little more and purchasing the set that does not require a USB to function.
5,This a by far was a very great investment love the feel and how all is wireless... Plus the fact that the 10-Key is detached hug plus! am left handed and this just works great for me!
1,I have this product for half a year and deeply disappointed with its quality.I'm a software developer so the keyboard and mouse were heavily used.After couple of month poor quality of materials started to pop up.First of all the mouse rubber material already peals off (may be seen on the picture).Keyboard wrist pad looks like it'd been used for years (picture attached).In addition F keys are being stuck (look on F5 on attached picture) . It really annoys as programmers constantly use those F buttons.
5,Have this set at work and had to get one for my home computer as well. I highly recommend this product.
1,I had been buying these for folks at my company because they seem to fit the needs of most everybody but then they started breaking.  Like 6 of them broke within weeks of each other.  I called MS support and they said that the product is discontinued due to a manufacturer defect and they will replace it with a new model coming out within the next few months.  Funny as it is still for sale on their site!  Anyway either wait for the new bluetooth model they are coming out with or find another product as this one will likely die soon into it use.
5,Best ergonomic keyboard I've ever used and the only one that does not detract from my typing. Futuristic clean-line design.
2,The build quality is great but I could not get over the layout. If the usual extended keyboard layout was used it would be the best keyboard. I tried using it for a month but gave up and purchased the “surface” version which is an extended keyboard with the ergo shaping.
5,This is an incredible keyboard.  I originally bought this to replace the one that came with my computer and I love it.  The feeling of it takes a little getting used to but once you do it is amazing.
5,Good ergonomic desktop keyboard that eliminates the wires across your desk.  One small micro dongle and your done.  Should have purchase a long time ago.  Good price and excellent quality.
5,I love this set I'm on my second one. First one I lost the dongle now I see you can store it under the mouse. I'm contacting Microsoft for a new dongle!
1,The usb dongle stopped working after a few weeks.  I know that is the issue because if you continually press it into the computer it will start working but otherwise it won't make a connection.  So the whole purchase is a bust if/when that doesn't work.  Based on the Microsoft website and other comments/reviews replacing the dongle is not an option.  What a waste of money.  I would expect better service from Microsoft than this.
4,Great keyboard and mouse. the num pad lags and consistently drops off first digit
5,This keyboard is an excellent ergonomic solution for anyone dealing with pain relating to typing! Keeps hands in very natural positions.
1,Mouse does not work right. It will be fine for a few days then it skips like crazy. Very disappointed in Microsoft support. Did I say "support"? Because there really isn't any. I tried calling and after looking and looking found a phone number to call. I got a guy who could barely speak English and he was of no help at all. Even my computer tech guy that came over was not able to figure out why the mouse is not working correctly all of the time. I have since bought a Logitech mouse and will be using that instead. I wasted my money on this keyboard and set up.
2,Not so great improvement over previous ergonomic desktop models just looks are different. The mouse is still uncomfortable. I find low height mouse is best for reducing wrist stress. One day minimal use and you can clearly see the wear on the wrist rest of the keyboard. Got to use this with the keyboard bottom stand otherwise the ergonomic position is not really ergonomic without it. I liked the Ergonomic Desktop 7000 which keep on dying after a 1.5 yrs of use each time.
5,A high quality product I've used ergonomic keyboards from Microsoft for a while now and this one tops everything. The keys are soft and elegant and everything wireless.I've used with my mac without any setup it works as expected.
5,This is my second one.  I love this and I don't think I would ever use anything else.  It would be nice if the number key is same level of the keyboard and that still removable.
5,There is nothing wrong with it the keyboard just didn't work well for me. I could get used to the odd configuration.
1,This is my second purchase of this keyboard. The first started having issues staying connected to the computer even with new batteries and the dongle less than 1 foot away just about a year after purchase. This keyboard the second purchase of this model is now 14 months old and the left portion of the split space bar has given out. The right portion of the space bar is working fine but is this just the beginning? I've used Microsoft ergo keyboards for years on multiple systems (work home secondary system) and never had any issues until this series. It just doesn't seem durable compared to earlier versions.
5,thanks for your on time delivery....it's so much more thing that i ever had...
5,Microsoft makes great keyboards and this one is incredibly sleek and works great. I typically don't use the keypad so it's nice that I can keep it off to the side separately.
5,I absolutely love this keyboard.  The only issue I have is with the Escape key that is oddly placed but I don't use it enough for it to be a problem for me.
5,My first time use of Ergonomic keyboard and mouse.Very chic looking. Not sure how to clean the wrist pad for the keyboard
4,Nice except it take getting used to the separate number keypad.
5,my new most favorite keyboard and mouse!! very good responsiveness on the keyboard. mouse is great protects against hand fatigue. small mouse movements are all you need to move the cursor around the screen (in my case screens)
3,Mouse bottom had scratches. I wonder if it really is NEW.
5,I received a set as a gift for work. It was so comfortable and easy for my wrists that I bought a set for home.
5,Great product.  Easy to use and helping with wrist pain immediately
1,I have contacted Microsoft for a replacement and they just keep passing me around with no satisfaction.  number key pad stopped working 5 months ago and works when it wants.  use the key pad all the time and look up and the 147 are not working.  Have used this ergo wireless type from Microsoft since they cam out.  NEVER AGAIN UNLESS MICROSOFT GETS THIS ISSUE TAKEN PLACE WITH ME.
2,I'm a great typist over 120 wpm but this split design is very frustrating.  Don't buy it unless you want to spend all day typing and untyping and retyping again.  One or both hands will slip off correct position.  Drives me crazy.
1,So I actually like the keyboard and the mouse.  But I broke the propriatary(!) USB transceiver and called the support line.  The call center person said that they did not replace the transceiver and that I should go to a retail store and buy a replacement.  I noted that it was a proprietary(!) transceiver and it was not sold at a retail store (she was talking about Best Buy not an MSFT retail store.  I asked.)  Then I got "I am sorry sir we do not offer this part" over and over again.  I have been using MSFT keyboards for 16 years but it looks like my streak ends now.
1,It was great for my carpal tunnel for the first 3 months but now it doesn't work. I have to wiggle the USB wireless chip for about 5 minutes before I can get the mouse or keyboard to make a connection with the computer.I would gladly give this 5 stars if the USB chip still worked. It was great when it worked but I don't have the patience to wiggle the USB with one hand and the mouse with the other for 5 minutes each time I come back to the computer.
4,works well
5,I'm writing this review on the keyboard right now and I have to say it's great.  No discomfort with the keys everything functions properly no lag time since it's wireless.  Great keyboard very happy I got it!
3,a bit strange to use but getting used to them.
5,Best keyboard/mouse combo I've had yet.
5,As might be expected Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop is typical Microsoft Natural Keyboard and very comfort for hands.But..I expected separated numeric keypad to be usefull It is inconvenient unexpectedly.I think the best approach is a conservative one.
2,Third ergonomic keyboard by Microsoft.  First one had the space bar break within about two months.  Second one lasted a while longer before the usb fob stopped working (killing the mouse use as well).  I got this one in January 2015 and today the left arrow button has stopped responding.  I think I've finally learned my lesson.  Stop buying these Microsoft keyboards if you want to remain productive at work.
5,❤️❤️❤️❤️ this keyboard is super fantastic❤️❤️❤️❤️ not like other versions of split keyboards in the past. easy adjustment period and mouse is a dream. Will not be money wasted for someone who uses all day!!
5,I was unsure when purchasing but highly recommend this product. The price was right and the service was great as usual.
3,all keyboards are weird now.  the 10 key uses an odd size coin battery which I had to get at a battery store.  all in all not super impressed no problems works as intended
1,We really liked the mouse and the keyboard design but the mouse doesn’t work well! We thought the batteries just died quickly I’d replace the batteries then my husband would replace the batteries. We’d restart the computer...unplug and replug the usb...but it’s just a crappy setup. Other people have mentioned it in the reviews too! It’s extremely disappointing  to spend a hundred bucks on a keyboard and mouse that crap out entirely after just a couple months of VERY light use.
5,Love the keyboard and mouse everything was shipped and arrived on time. Very comfortable. The mouse fits great in my hand.  One note I'm typewriter trained.  If you are a one finger typist you will not like it.
2,I have had this keyboard for a little over a year and the both the mouse and the numerical keypad are broken. I love the ergonomics of the actual keyboard but I've had to purchase a separate number pad and now I will probably have to buy a new mouse.
4,The number key pad stopped working and other than that it's pretty good.
5,Me encanto súper cómodo y fácil de usa
1,Loved it but now that the tiny dongle is lost there is no way to replace it and now the whole thing is trash. So frustrated.
1,My husband is a web developer so he's constantly using a keyboard. His wrists really started to bother him so I decided to buy him this for our anniversary. He loves it and says that it has alleviated the pain and made it a lot easier on him.Update: after only using it a couple of weeks the keyboard stopped working. My husband has tried everything to fix it but it just sort of died on him. The mouse still works really well but the keyboard is a no go. Really disappointed.
2,Protect your dongle! It is irreplaceable and very fragile. I was able to use this set for about a month before the dongle malfunctioned. It had worked if I pinched the casing together but it is now completely unusable. Very expensive paperweight.
5,Best ergonomic keyboard ever! I am a software engineer and this keyboard makes me more peoductive without wirst pain.Mouse is amazing but I found it a little small for my big hands.
2,ReVising my reView... LoVe tHe design but seVeral keys HaVe failed inCluding V C and H as you Can see in my typing. Also zero key Constantly stiCks. Quality is Horrible. Hoping I just got a bad unit but now return period Has expired and I'm out $75. Also totallY Helped witH wrist pain so really need tHe design going forward. Guess I'll giVe anotHer try.
1,I was under the impression this was a new keyboard mouse and number pad set.  When received it was obviously not new.  It was in poor shape with one of the keys had popped off (which is why I purchased in the first place).  It took a while after receiving this set for me to use the keyboard (without the missing key) and as I use the keyboard I notice the wrist rest is coming up/apart.
5,I’ve been really happy with the purchase. Looks great and feels good typing.
1,I LOVE this keyboard so much that when my first one stopped working for NO REASON after just 7 months I went ahead and spent another $100 for a new one only to have the exact same thing happen at 10 months. Reading the reviews reveals that this is a very common occurrence. I’m so frustrated because I absolutely love everything about this keyboard I just need it to work
5,Keyboard and mouse fantastic has helped my wrist and arm greatly.  I type 8 hours per day this has been a life saver. The only thing that I am totally not satisfied with is the seperate key pad.
4,Works well.  Have not had it long enough to evaluate battery life.
5,By far this is the most comfortable keyboard and mouse combo I've ever used.  I don't use the 10 key side car a lot so it's nice to save prime desk space.  It's quiet smooth and looks great.
1,I got mine in April and have loved it; however it is not September and it doesnt work anymore.  New batteries uninstall and reinstall no matter what it will work for a short 30 second window and then stop.  It is a shame because it helped my wrist a lot.
1,I've suffered through this keyboard for over 6 months before I could save up to replace it. By then I wasn't able to return it. I've had to retype every word in this review. I bought it a year ago with a new computer - it should've worked. I needed it to work because I have arthritis. It feels nice and reduces fatigue but not when you have to retype everything. I do not recommend this keyboard. The mouse works fine.
1,I loved the keyboard and mouse but it stopped working in the first month. I returned it and got a new one but that has also stopped communicating after 6 months. I think it's just the USB dongle but you can't buy anything to replace it. Good design and loved it while it was working but to get two bad ones in a row makes me think they made it cheaply.
1,Glitchy.  I bought one for my husband who works on a PC and one for me to use with a Macbook.  On my Mac it just suddenly stops working all the time.  On my husband’s PC it keeps glitching.  Certain keys stop working or start keying when they shouldn’t be.
1,In terms of being ergonomic the keyboard and mouse are designed well. The exception is the function keys are separated by a greater distance than other traditional keyboards and may require lifting the hand from the keyboard to locate them. If you're a developer like me with medium to large hands I still had to move my hands to get to the some of the keys I use frequently.I returned this product because the keyboard did not function well. Others have reported a firmware/wireless issue where the keyboard failed to respond to keystrokes intermittently. A show stopper for me. The keyboard this was to replace was also wireless and worked just fine in the very same system/desk. May have been defective.
1,I loved this keyboard for its comfort and in particular the separate numeric keypad so that I can use it only when I need it and my arm doesn't need to extend so far to the right to use the mouse which I do constantly.  This has relieved quite a bit of shoulder pain.  However I would expect a $100 keyboard to last at least the full year of its warranty which it did not. I did not abuse it or drop it yet the function key has become stuck and constantly keys without any input.  It has been just over 9 months and it's now worthless. I would expect this from a $20 keyboard but not at this price.
5,One of the best keyboard setups i ahve ever used (I am using it right now) and it took only a couple days to get used to it.
1,I am VERY unhappy with this product!  The USB transceiver is about the size of a piece of gum.  After 6 weeks I lost mine.  I called Microsoft customer service with the transceivers's model number in hand only to be told that it was not replaceable.  The customer service supervisor I spoke with said that there simply was no way to replace the lost transceiver.  I'm now in a position to have to throw away an otherwise perfectly functional keyboard and mouse.  I will NOT buy another Microsoft product!
5,Great keyboard and mouse thinking about ordering a second one for work!Really nice feel and comfortable.
1,If you like me were taught to type '6' with the index finger of your right hand this is going to annoy you to no end because you have to type it with the index finger of your left hand. You also have to be very careful about feeling for the bumps (aka nipples) on the 'f' and 'j' keys to make sure your hands are in the correct position.
5,It took me a couple of days to get used to the key placement but once I did I love it. I work form home in front of a computer all day and this is a wonderful ergonomic keyboard.
5,Nicely designed relatively slim and comfortable. The detachable 10 key is a bonus. Mouse works smoothly and fits nicely in a my hand. If you need an ergonomic keyboard this is a nice option.
5,Best keyboard out there. It is just perfect. The angles are great. Key response excellent. Mouse is good for medium-to-large hand. The only thing missing is backlighting.
1,I had this for a month and the dongle was damaged after typical wear and tear of sitting on a desk. The dongle is unique to the keyboard/mouse and a replacement is not an option so this is going in the trash. Other brands are much smaller and more durable. Will not be purchasing again.
3,The mouse and keyboard look a bit used out of the box but they work fine.
5,I love these I have carpel tunnel syndrome and haven't had any pain in a long time. I have a set at work and a set at home.
5,PERFECT for my desk.  I need ergonomic keyboards and this one is incredible.  The side number pad is just what is needed.  The mouse is very comfortable even with small hands.
5,Bought it to use at the office - really good keyboard and easy on my hands and arms.
5,Love this keyboard Combo!! Have had it over a year now and it is still kicking!! Connects right up. Never had had any issues with it!
5,Best keyboard I've ever had. Took me a day or two to get used to it but now I fly over the keyboard. It's way easier on my hands. The mouse click is a little loud though.
5,Love this so much that I got one for my office at work and at home.
5,I really like this keyboard.  I especially like the detached number pad.
4,Works great but battery life is too low (1 month)
5,Very good keyboard comfy typing. Mouse is the best I've ever used
2,On July 6 2015 I order the Microsoft Sculpt keyboard from Adorama Camera a vendor of Amazon.  I am using the keyboard at work and have had it a little over a month.  The space bar is now sticking.  I contacted Adorama Camera and was told the keyboard is non-returnable.  I have just learned a valuable lesson... ALWAYS use my Prime account!
1,I had to come back and update my review because I accidentally pushed my computer next to the wall and the USB adapter that comes with the keyboard/mouse was bent slightly which caused it to stop working - Microsoft DOES NOT have a solution for this. If you lose or break your usb adapter they will NOT sell you a new one so you might as well throw the entire keyboard\mouse in the trash.Unbelievable. After so many years of making keyboards you would think microsoft would use a Unifying USB receiver like Logitech doesONLY Logitech from now on!
5,I have two of these now one way home and another one at work has improved my posture as well as typing speed not to mention it is a head turner. Love this set
5,Very comfortable for your wrist and forearm.Fast and smooth typing.
1,I have actually purchased this same keyboard three times now. THREE TIMES. in hopes that it was just a fluke that i got a defective product......delete key locks and deletes whatever is in its path. EMAILS! terrible and time consuming to undo!the keyboard freezes and i have to unplug the connection in order for it to unfreeze.ridiculous. Microsoft PLEASE fix this!!
5,I wouldn't buy anything else.
1,I loved this product for its design and it is really comfortable.I was always annoyed and worried about the size of bluetooth dongle.It broke in the first few months and doesnt work anymore.Now i dont know how much i have to spend to get the bluetooth dongle without which the keyboard is a useless.Microsoft could have applied some ergonomic attention to the bluetooth dongle.
1,It was great while it lasted. Well except that the 2 key stuck from the get go. The "l" key started to stick and I was able to pop it off clean underneath and then pop it back on again and it worked fine for a while. Then the "a" key started to stick. There was an eyelash underneath. Couldn't pop it back on. Anyway not sure what to do now. This lasted me about six months. My last keyboard lasted years.
5,I get all of the ergo Microsoft desktop sets and have yet to be disappointed.  I LOVE my new Sculpt desktop set and recommend it to anyone who works on a computer all day every day.
1,The keyboard touch  is fine.  However there are some issues.The main problem is that the mouse button sticks.There are also some preference issues.  I like the separate numeric keypad.  However Microsoft removed or relocated some of the traditional keys from the main keyboard.  For example I'm used to an Enter key on the lower right of the keypad.  This keypad doesn't have it.
5,I love the look and feel of the keyboard but it does take some getting used to. Keep in mind that I've been using split keyboards for years. I would definitely recommend it to a friend.
5,Best wireless keyboard of my life. And I've had many. Truly a proud purchase. I brag about it to all my friend.
1,The usb dongle sticks out about half an inch and is easily broken. Microsoft no longer covers this under warranty and there are no replacements. The usb dongle is a critically important peace that is very susceptible to breaking. Avoid until the usb dongle is changed to a flat dongle like Logitech.
1,Wow what a quality... From the moment I plugged in the keyboard started typing double words for about 10-20% of the time.  Also the USB wireless adapter caused a crash twice during a reboot process.  I suspect it's the cheap USB dongle which is the most cases with double typing problem on wireless keyboards.  What a shame.. such a nice product which I like the design idea the layout and everything plagued by such a cheap component.I requested for a replacement through Amazon rather than a refund to give it another chance.  I will report back once I have a new product.
1,I am typing iwth the keybooooooooooooooooooard and the keys just keep getting stuck this truly was a waste of money. DO NOT BUY THIS  KEYBOARD it may  look gooddddddddddddddddddddddd buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut its worthless. I am typing with it now so see for yourself how much errors it does I want a refund.
5,It has taken me a little time to get use to the feel but it is growing on me day by day.  The mouse is awesome and feels great in my hands.  Great product.
4,Very nice upgrade from the Microsoft 4000 keyboard.
5,Best keyboard ever!  Rarely if ever use the keypad (although let me tell you if I needed it this thing is really awesome and even could be used as a game pad!
1,I think it's the wireless feature but they lag.... HARD and occasionally give out a weird error where it's backspacing every program you have non stop. For ergonomics it's good and the mouse design is great but for work... they're both detrimental.I ended up replacing both with cheap oem Dell keyboard and mouse that work perfectly :( currently looking for other solutions. Way to expensive for these results!
1,I'm very frustrated that I spent 140 bucks on a defective keyboard. I'm afraid to ask for a new one because this seems to be a common issue. I just wasted an hour and a half of my work day trying to fix this problem.Luckily I can send it back pretty easily except for the cost of the box. I do appreciate that returning it is relatively simple.
1,While I mostly love the keyboard and mouse the USB dongle is part of the package too and if it breaks or you lose it then the entire set is useless. I called Microsoft today because my USB dongle broke (see picture; it just got slightly bent) and they said because the dongle is paired at the factory with the keyboard and mouse there is nothing they can do.
4,Key layout is a little different but works great.
5,Easy to set up.Easy to use.
5,I tried 3 different keyboards and this is the best
5,I love this keyboard. My wrists do not hurt after a long day of work.
5,My absolute favorite keyboard. Batteries have a very long life. The removed number pad is convenient. The mouse is very comfortable. And the keys are especially easy to press.
5,Great bundle. It is very comfortable but it takes a little time to get use to. Well worth it.
5,Only took me a few minutes to get the hang of it and I love it. My husband is not so crazy about the design. I definitely recommend it as someone who is keyboard savvy.
4,it's great but buttons stop working some times.
5,Great Product - Would buy again
5,The only thing I miss is the delete key in the lower right corner but I love the shape and the feel of the keys. Have not used the numeric.
1,This product is inconsistent.  First the 10 key went out and would not come back on. The line of sight to the fob for all 3 pieces is ridiculous and you can't use them just where you are comfortable.  Last the fob shorted out my number keys on the laptop.  It is no longer useable and I literally only used it for 45 days.  45 days of struggle.  I should have returned it.
1,Terrible behavior. Numeric Keyboard doesn't work. Keyboard doesn't write all keys. Because it was used batteries were died I needed to replace them.There are a lot of complains in Internet. Unfortunately I didn't read them until I got the problem.I bought it because I need an ergonomic keyboard to avoid damage on my wrist... I trusted in Microsoft brand.Please stop offering it.
5,Excellent if you've had to make changes because of carpal tunnel issues.
3,Decided to send it back because I didn't like the detached number pad.  I just want to add the USB (for wireles purposes) is stored inside the mouse.
5,Great ergonomic keyboard.
1,the USB transceiver that comes with this keyboard and mouse is not universal and further it is unique to each item. Which means if you lose the transceiver (which is very likely since it's a tiny piece) or if you accidentally break it (which is also likely if you hit the doors or corners with your laptop with the transceiver in the USB port) there is no replacement transceiver available and you will have to buy the whole product all over again. Which is a shame I think considering the great quality of the key-board and mouse.
1,The left key of the mouse stopped working after 6 months. I searched online and found this was a common problem for this product.  I need to drive for 4 hours round trip to replace it. There is no online replacement for the warranty. It's hard to believe this unsatisfactory support for such an expensive keyboard mouse set.
5,It’s really nice and i adapt to it in the first day.
5,Bought one for work like it so much that I ordered this one for home. I will never go back to regular keyboard styles.
5,I'm getting used to it the feel of this keyboard is really soft and I'm liking it a lot.
4,so-so
1,Do not get this!! The USB dongle broke easily and there is no replcement making the whole set garbage. A waste of money and bad for the environment!  Like having to throw a car away when the key is lost!!!
5,This is my favorite PC keyboard and mouse of all time.  The keyboard is 'chiclet' style as they are using on MacBooks now.  The mouse is extremely comfortable to use.
5,Keyboard wrks good!
5,Obsessed with this keyboard
5,It takes time to get used to the keyboard but after you are used to it it is great.
2,switch for F keys is a hassle since there is no toggle for function keys.I am a developer so function keys are used often.was originally for my wife but mouse was too large for her hand and bothered her wrist...the mouse was fine but I need the function keys.
3,not the quality I expected from Mircosoft
5,I began developing wrist problems and warning signs or carpal tunnel syndrome but this keyboard put me back in shape.  This things looks odd but feels wonderful to type on!
5,I love the keyboard and mouse.  Haven't had any issues with my wrist since using it.  Highly recommend it.
1,My first couple weeks with this keyboard set was good.  i've had it since February and have had to replace the battery in the 10 key pad 5 times.  These batteries are not cheap and in my opinion something with that type of battery should stay charged for a longer period of time.  Maybe there is something wrong with my particular item but i am not happy with the quality.  Good luck to anyone who purchases this product.Candi from Louisiana
5,It might take a few hours to get used to but if you're a touch typist this is the last keyboard you'll ever need.
1,Sadly this product (USB ID 045e:07a5) is affected by the MouseJack vulnerability.  There is one driver update but it is only for the Windows driver leaving other clients that use a different operating systems exposed.  I looked in the microsoft support forums and found no official response to the support requests related to this problem.I like the keyboard design but sadly I will have to stop using it due to this security problem.
5,works great.
1,I am not one to write reviews but this product is so horrible that I feel the need to warn others.I first bought this product in 2015. It worked great for a year and a half and then stopped working. I really liked the design so I bit the bullet and bought it again. It lasted exactly a month and then stopped working. Garbage. DO NOT BUY.
5,I love this keyboard really comfortable but beware the usb is easy to break if you frequently unplug and plugin.
1,I really love the design of this keyboard however the quality is very poor with the keyboard.  I have owned the product for less than a year and the period key and the shift key on the left side have stopped responding.  considering the price of the keyboard I expected this to last much longer.  I have had Logitech keyboards for several years and never had a problem with keys not responding like this.  I do love the Mouse however it is the perfect design.
4,not bad
5,This is a great setup! so functional and cool. The buttons on the keyboard are quiet and I really like the spring reaction.
2,The keyboard itself is nice (would be nicer if it had a backlight like my previous Logitech K800 keyboard.  However the keyboard  stops working intermittently.  It will first repeat the last key typed infinitely and then stop working.  I have to unplug the USB transmitter that come with the Sculpt Desktop and plug it back in for it to work.  I'm running Windows 8.
5,Brilliant product I have been a fan of sculptured keyboards for many years and this is extremely well designed I really like the separate keypad particularly as a calculator.
5,This thing works very well I am glad I bought I had to get use to the number pad being separate but that didn't take long at all but it works well.
5,Takes some getting used too but I have since graduated with a degree in ergonomics and aesthetic keyboards.
2,I was pretty excited to get this hoping it would be awesome I returned it.  For me I did not like how the number keys worked and how the entire set up functioned.  Indeed it is really beautiful the design is amazing but the reality was other ergonomic sets are way better at least for me.
5,Smooth modern design that offers great functionality and comfort.Would definitely recommend to others and will probably purchase another for home office.
5,Mouse and keyboard take a little getting used to but love the results
5,Super easy set up and I've only replaced the batteries once in the last 2 years. Thinking about buying another one for home.
5,I have been using the keyboard and mouse for about six weeks.  One of the best purchases I made this year.  My tendinitis is gone!
5,Husband loves it... Me not so much.. too hard to get use to.
3,If you use the Vi editor this keyboard is not a good choice.  The escape key is tiny and it is not a real key it is a button.
1,The design of the keyboard and mouse is really good.  They do help my arthritic hands to feel better ... BUT ... It will only work as long it has connection via the Bluetooth dongle. The problem is the dongle is VERY fragile and likely to break. When it breaks you're out $80 to $120 to buy a new set. Just got off the phone with MS Helpless Desk and they confirmed the separate piece is not available.  Time to try something different.
5,Took a little bit of getting used to the new design but once you get it...you are glad that you got it.  Have bought two more just like it.  Recommend.
5,A little on the expensive side in my opinion but I have to admit it's still worth it.  Light weight and super comfortable.
5,Helped with my wrist strain. Still using original batteries. I have absolutely no complaints
5,This keyboard is a life saver. My wrists were killing me from 8+ hours of typing and after purchasing this keyboard my wrist pain is gone!
5,It works
1,I guess I know why I got such a great deal it didn't come with the transceiver. Without the transceiver non of the items work. Microsoft won't replace the transceiver - "you have to buy a whole new set". The person who sold this item knew it didn't have the transceiver knowing I wouldn't be able to replace it. Nothing in the product description stated that the transceiver was missing.
3,Keys lose lettering after a few weeks of use
5,As a software engineer this product meets all my expectations when looking for a comfortable keyboard.
1,I have purchased two of these devices and both had keys go out within six months. There are some serious issues with these devices and I cannot recommend them. Also Microsoft charges shipping to send them back while they're under warranty so it is utterly useless. It would cost almost as much to ship them to and from Microsoft as to buy a new set. I'm not willing to do either. If someone can recommend an alternative keyboard I am all ears.
5,Love this keyboard!
5,Fantastic quality and works perfectly with my Mac.
5,The sculpt really is a great product. It's comfortable and easy on the wrists. Unfortunately...  once you get used to it using other keyboards is tedious.
1,I love this keyboard/mouse combination. Unfortunately about a year in the keyboard quit working entirely. I tried to contact Microsoft for support but ended up in a continuous loop of "customer service" that didn't service my needs at all. Amazon (the seller) couldn't help as my return window had closed. Very disappointed.
5,This is really cool and I was waiting on a small ergonomic keyboard for a long time now.Thanks Amazon for this product.nehru
2,USB receiver died within 4 months of using it. I called Microsoft parts department (after many call transfers) and they will only exchange the entire product meaning I have to pay return shipping. So essentially plan to pay an extra $15-20 more for the product.
5,Comfortable to use especially with a standing desk. The keys are nicely responsive. the calculator button is amazing
5,Great comfortable design. Looks sleek comfortable to use all day-reduces stress on your wrists; keys make a very pleasant sound when you type
5,excellent  I highly recommend it for people who gets wrist and figures pain from typing  It is one of my best investments . price is reasonable too
1,Complete garbage. First of all the keyboard didn't come with batteries like reviews claimed it would. The back of the mouse keeps popping off because there's really nothing holding it in place. The mouse is the only thing that works after installing all the drivers the keyboard worked for a second and then as soon as I unplugged my USB keyboard and mouse the wireless keyboard and mouse stopped working. The mouse eventually came back on but the keyboard and keypad remain non-functional. Returning immediately.
1,Fantastic love it super comfortable. Get it you'll love it. I can code for hours on it without any wrist/forearm fatigue.BUT... I received a used product marked NEW. Batteries were missing (good indicator being that the product says "Batteries included". Top right is scuffed/scratched up and the bottom of the keyboard and mouse are pretty filthy. In addition several keys were stuck full of gunk and the entire keyboard is clearly covered in fingerprints and grime.Features: GreatCondition: poorSeller: poor
5,Works flawlessly. No disconnects or lag. And the ergonomic design is feels really natural and comfortable.
5,Exactly what I was looking for thanks!
4,nice works well
4,done
2,Had some wireless connectivity issues as soon as I got it then after about two days the keyboard completely stopped connecting whatsoever. At first the keyboard would simulate without me touching it at all a permanent shift key being held down and if I disconnected it and reconnected it it would fix the issue. Then two days later it stopped connecting at all.
1,Will not buy again.  Less than a year old the N key sticks and Microsoft said too bad they only have a 90 day warrantee.
5,Very comfortable keyboard and mouse.However the battery size of keyboard and mouse are different (Why? Keyboard:AAA Mouse: AA).In addition I cannot find proper keyboard skin yet.
5,Love this keyboard.  I had so much wrist pain and now none.  I would buy it again.
5,Comfortable easy installation and good durability of the batteries.Highly recommend for anyone who needs comfort for long hours with the computer or problems such as tendonitis on hands.
1,Issues with the keyboard - particularly the letter F and S never registered on the first click.Besides that it completely stopped communicating with my laptop and any other computer in my house. Would not purchase again and wish I could return it.
5,Excellent keyboard
5,It's just what I expected - I like it very much.  No complaints I am enjoying just as I thought I would.  Love the sepaerate number pad.
5,I very like this concept that numlock keys seating separate. Very unique and comfortable keyboard.
2,Mouse click button is sticky does not release properly like other mice (not same quality as other Logitech made devices).  USB receiver malfunctioned 4 months after purchase (only used it for 2.5 months in total).
5,I've only been using it a day but I can already tell a difference in how tired my wrists are.  Love it!
1,USB connector not recognizing. Now whole product is useless just because usb  dongle is not working and there is no replacement for it.Very bad planing one bad usb connector can destroy the whole product
2,Great ergonomics but longevity of the mouse stopped at 1.5 years of use. Will not be buying the mouse again.
5,Great Keyboard. Was unsure of the mouse at first but it works great. Probably would not use it as a gaming mouse but great for everyday/office purposes!
5,If you know how to type then this keyboard is more comfortable and easier to use. If you are a hen-pecker then it won't make much difference.
3,Battery on the number keyboard does not last long needs to be replaced often it gets expensive since it used the small round batteries.
1,This keyboard mouse and keypad began to fail within an unacceptable amount of time.
2,Best keyboard I can find but their micro USB is very poorly built and I've had to go through five of these in two years including two through manufacturers warranty. The manufacturer is very easy to work with the product just needs improvement.
3,Worked great for months but now the windows key sticks every once in awhile.
1,I bought this Ergonomic Wireless Desktop keyboard and mouse in November 2018 and now (4/9/2019) the keyboard freezes up. I have changed the batteries but the keyboard still freezes and then I have to take out the battery and replace it again for it to work for a few minutes.
5,Takes a little time to get used to and does nice on your desk.
5,Connects every time and works great. Love being able to move Numeric keypad anywhere I want. Mouse although large feels great!
1,Have just been onto microsoft support for 90 minutes to try and make this work but still no luck : (Once the dongle stops working the keyboard is landfill which seems like a TERRIBLE waste.
1,Good ergonomics. - terrible quality - failed to function after 6 months
5,Works really well has helped my wrist problems. Takes a little getting used to but not awkward. I use every day and batteries last around 2 - 3 weeks.
2,Don't get me wrong I love the keyboard in many ways BUT what I still don't get is how they Keyboard wrist can be of such a bad quality.It's confortable but after just a week of (not full-time) use it has a lot of marks. And I'm talking that I've only used it a couple of hours each day.
5,The best Microsoft ergonomic keyboard that I have encountered so far.  Love the fact that the 10 keypad can be moved.  Very pleased so far.
1,It's junk it eats about 50 batteries a year and no stuck keys.
3,fine
5,Works great
1,Does not work with my desktop. My Windows desktop is not accepting transreceiver and giving error message. I have tried on Mac but that also not accepting transreceiver and giving error message. Return freight from India to US for individual item is high and so the product is stuck with me and money wasted at present as their is no Microsoft support for the product in India.
5,This is a great setup.  I am on the computer all the time and this set up really reduces the strain on my hands fingers and wrists.
1,Doesn't work on a Mac OS 10.68. I've tried asking about set up on Amazon and tried to get help on Microsoft. No driver or instructions on how to do the wireless set up with usb device plugged in. My system preferences bluetooth doesn't read it. I have an MS Intelligent Keyboard and Evoluent Mouse with usb.  And now I'm 4 days too late to return it so I'm stuck with a non-working   Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop (L5V-00001)        .
5,Great set! Very ergonomic typing is a pleasure now.
1,I bought this new and I was given a used one. The box has tape on both sides and one side was already cut.
5,Love it... and takes up less space on my desk.
1,This product is totally dependent on the dongle. If you don't lose anything that's great but if you lose this particular dongle you are out of luck. I lost the dongle and called Microsoft support to see if it could be replaced. They said NO that the set is a full set and the dongle is tuned to that particulare keyboard mouse and number pad. There is NO WAY to replace it.
1,The mouse is a little big and the keyboard takes a bit of getting used to. Also the batteries in the keyboard and the number pad die very quickly. Overall however very satisfied.UPDATED 14-Nov-14: I had this keyboard for 4-5 months and then it stopped working (at least certain keys stopped). The tab key broke and I am not able to type a capital V for some reason. For the price point this should not last five months.
1,This keyboard absolutely was the worst one I've owned. I have had over 50 keyboards as I run an office. By the time I wanted to return it it was too late. The thing died letters did not show up when pressed other keys would stay held down and mess up the computer in terms of trying to complete actions repeatedly all this slowed me down. Never buy this unit; especially from Microsoft. Terrible and expensive mistake on my part.
5,This has been a great keyboard and mouse setup.  I use this one at work and I would definitely buy another one for home use.
5,Worked well until the USB went faulty. Shipment was fast and the packaging was great.
1,I want my money back. I literally went to return this item today and it said I no longer had that option. This thing sucks I have to change the batteries every other day and I just want a refund so I can buy one that works! Super disappointed
3,I ordered 9 of these and I have already had to send 2 back because they stopped working. One did not last a week.
2,I've had this keyboard and mouse for quite some time now. It has taken a lot of getting used to but I love the ergonomic sculpture of the keyboard. However; the 10-key pad does not work all the time and it is quite aggravating. About to switch back to my previous keyboard and throw this one in the trash.
1,USB failed after 4 months.
5,Great product would recommend.
5,The only thing is I still can't type 60 words per minute! I thought this was a magic key board!:)
2,Be careful with transceiver!I bought the set just for one month and accidentally broke the transceiver. There is no replacement part from Microsoft. (Well security guys may be happy with it).Under this circumstance I wish to go with Unifying Transceiver (like Logitech) which I could easily find 2nd-hand on street.
2,I'm not a touch typist and I found the split keyboard annoying. The mouse felt great in my hand but the response was lousy. I tried different tracking speeds/settings but it didn't help.
5,I used this keyboard for 8 years I have one kit at home and another at office. The only complain I have for this product is the soft veneer wrap on both the keyboard and the mouse they start to get loose after a few years of heavy use (I'm a software engineer so I type a lot). But I think it's a minor problem which doesn't affect my daily use so I'm giving it a five star.The keyboard is comfortable relatively quiet compact and light it's the best ergo keyboard out there. I used to own 6 mechanical keyboards but those are just for showing off for real productivity this keyboard is much better.The mouse is not as good as the keyboard but perfectly workable.
5,Well made comfortable nice feel to keys. Separate 10 key pad a real bonus out of the way when not need.
1,The Keyboard design is excellent and very comfortable to type but the wireless connection for number key is terrible I had to constantly move it around from one position to other within my work space to make it connect  Picture shows only position that all 3 pieces to function properly.  The product name should be changed to Non-Ergonomic Desktop. I'm waiting for new keyboard to be shipped so I can throw this in the trash can.
5,Works great. My wrists no longer get sore when I have to spend a long time working at the computer.
5,Loving this keyboard set. I am very happy with how it works and the ergonomic fit.
5,Only wish it supplied usb rechargeable batteries otherwise the fell is great.
1,I ordered this twice and both times it took 6 months to get to me because they kept telling me that they couldn't mail to a PO Box but my address wasn't a PO Box.  Then both times when the keyboard got me they both broke within a couple of months of using.
3,Takes a while to get used to u. I am sure it is best after that but still working on it.
5,Very comfortable and good ergonomic keyboard. Probably one of the best that i have used till date.
1,I had high hopes for this keyboard when I ordered it. I'm a fan of the split keyboard design and this one looked especially interesting with the separate numeric key pad. I also liked the mouse. Now after five weeks of use keys are failing -- it's hard to write a test with no question mark. Key fail = one star. I'm calling tomorrow to return this to Microsoft (I'm just past my 1 month time limit with Amazon).
5,Love it but mouse forces your palm downward. Hurts my hand. Replaced mouse with angled product from a competitor.
1,I expect this review to be seen by the seller. I bought this item less than a year ago. This keyboard and mouse have stopped working after five months. Having paid $80 + and being a Microsoft I expected longevity. I understand it is still under the 1-year warranty. Please contact me to send my replacement. Thank you very much!
5,This a great product every one should have one if you type at all...
5,Like all types of these products it takes getting used to it. I have one at work so it was a seamless transition. Great product!
5,Finest keyboard and mouse I have ever seen or used.Unfortunately the receiver uses up a USB port. Hopefully the next iteration uses Bluetooth instead.
1,The mouse would "time out" so I had to get it replaced. The replacement mouse does the same thing. Also the keyboard and mouse now have different USB receivers so I have to use a second USB port instead of one. The keyboard and the number pad work pretty well. The mouse.....not so much.
5,I love the set so much I bought two. One for my home and office.
2,I love the design but bought in April and the letters on the keys are wearing off by September.
2,You better have really small hands as the picture looks like it will replace the existing key board I have been using from microsoft. but its really smaller than I can even use. I'll keep it for a travel size  key board?
5,I was so excited about this purchase that I couldn't wait to have it shipped so I bought this exact model from Best Buy. The keyboard is very nice and silent when typing however getting used to the split design it takes a bit of effort. It does feel more comfortable which is why I wanted it. I did a lot of research before this purchase and so far I do not regret it. Other than getting used to where the keys are it works perfectly fine. The 10 key is awesome I love that I can just use that for billing and it has a calculator button that allows me to open the calculator on the monitor with just a click. Now for the mouse. It does take some getting used to and feels a bit weird at first. I do have smaller hands and it feels big in my hands so definitely keep that in mind. But other than that I do like it I could already feel the difference. It relieves a lot of pressure from my wrist. Also has the windows button which I don't find a need for but others may and it is easily accessible.  I would say overall if you want it you should purchase it.
1,When it works it is great. Not reliable.  I use it on a MacBook.  The keyboard stopped working.  1 hour plus trying to get support from Microsoft. They told me I needed to talk to Apple even though the keyboard is clearly broken after 10 months. Mac users should try a different product.
5,This is the second one I've owned. This keyboard works perfectly and doesn't fatigue my wrists or hands.
1,I purchased this and the number 9 key started working intermittently.  I wrote to the vendor through Amazon twice about warranties and did not receive any response.  This is an expensive keyboard and I expected nothing but the best for the price.  I would assume because of the price a response never happened.
2,Not what I expected from Microsoft - if it hadn't been during tax season I would have sent it back!  I have the Wireless Keyboard 5000 and it was fantastic - just wore it out!
1,It worked fine the first 2 months then the number pad lost connectivity. Changed battery and still doesn't work. Now the keyboard falls out of sync. I never but a wireless keyboard and mouse before. This was such a bad experience!!! Can't even return it now.This item is no longer eligible for return.The return window closed on Jul 25 2015.Nice paper weight.Thanks for taking my money!!!
5,Love it. My wrist don’t hurt anymore.
5,Delivered prior to time expected. Keyboard was smaller than what I expected- which was exactly what I wanted for my desk!
5,Excellent product slim and sleek and very ergonomic
2,The function keys stick; I'm used it on a Dell XPS 9100 running Windows 8.1; the "Print Screen" key was constantly being detected; when my PC booted up I would hear the buzzing noise of the computer detecting a key being pressed (interrupt).I like the feel and design of the mouse and keyboard.
1,The mouse and keyboard are good but the transceiver is not.It's not very well designed and will get loose over time(10 months or so for me).I have to keep switching USB ports and it stops working occasionally.Also it seems just the transceiver CANNOT be replaced you have to buy the whole set again.Good thing I bought used from warehouse deals.
5,I very much like this keyboard.  For its compact size it fits my paws well.  The keys are soft but not mushy.
1,I have always used ergo keyboards but this one was really really hard to use. Not too mention the oversimplification of packaging left me searching for almost an hour for the USB plug. Who is the moron who thought putting it inside the mouse with no indication was a good idea? Fire that idiot... Returned and ended up buying the older version which not only is more comfortable it actually came with instructions...
1,i got this item and it was not as advertised. the item that i got did not have all the items as advertised. there were some parts missing. the item did not have any keys. i am not sure what to call an item a keyboard if it does not have any keys.
1,This keyboard is pretty comfortable and the keys are easy to press so the keyboard doesn't cause much strain on my hands. However I bought this keyboard in mid November 2015. By early February 2016 (so less than 3 months later) the backspace key has completely stopped working. Some internet research shows that this problem is not uncommon with this keyboard. Considering the price this keyboard should last more than three months.
5,This is a very well liked model  mouse takes some getting used to but I love the keyboard.
5,Item works perfectly and it arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Thanks!
5,Best keyboard I've ever used. The mouse took a little getting used to but the keyboard is outstanding. The keys feel similar to the keys on a macbook.
5,Excellent! Works well & separate keyboard & number pad easier to place & use. No problem. Does what it is supposed to do & works well. Good product!
5,nice
1,Quality control is horrible. I went through two orders and tested them on different computers running different versions of MS Windows. Only the mouse worked on both occasions. In regards to the first order the keyboard had problems connecting out of the box and eventually died weeks later. As to the re-order the keyboard and number pad would never connect - only the mouse worked. In gist good luck with this keyboard.
5,Great keyboard.
2,Straight out of the box and there’s scratches on the bottom of the mouse like it has been used.... a little disappointing.
5,Greatest keyboard around if you are on one all day
5,great feel nice hand position has nicer keyboard feel than the other microsoft natural keyboards. Short stroke keys quiet looks great on your desk
5,I like it so much . Typing the feeling is very good the sound is very light very light weight feel good You'll love the typing
2,Dissappointed that this now the second replacement has also failed.  This time with the keypad.  Replaced batteries.  The zero and 3 keys do not work anymore.  Sad.
5,Love it!
5,Took a little bit of time to get used to it but now I love it!
5,Love this keyboard!  It is so comfortable and I like having the numerals separate.  Highly recommended for left-handed users but great for right-handed also.
2,I bought two of these.  Both work fine for a year or so and then the keyboard stops working.  Both keyboards.  There is a two year warranty but still . . .
2,Amazingly the numerical pad stopped working properly 4 months after the warranty expired - Microsoft's engineers should get a raise their goals of achieving "planned obsolescence" are working perfectly!
1,Bought this in mid-May today the backspace key stopped working.  I expect other keys may follow suite at some time later.  I called up MS support and a replacement will be sent in 7-10 days.  OK that is fair enough but for $80 keyboard its reliability is rather dismal.  Not sure if it is a quality problem or a design problem but this is not good.
5,Well designed product
5,Took a week to get used to but no more wrist pain!  I'll switch all my keyboards to this.
5,I loved it so much I am going to purchase another one
5,My favorite keyboard and mouse combo.
2,This item was clearly a repackaged return but sold as new.  very disappointing for a 100 dollar keyboard.  Otherwise the keyboard is great but the mouse is pretty mediocre.
5,Just perfect Keyboard to keep my ergonomic in place and really soft the keys. I just love it.
5,Experimented with 3 keyboards/ mouse systems before choosing the Sculpt Ergonomic. More accurate easier to use. Takes up less space portable arrange able I love it!
5,Great great great.. Yes it's little hard to get used to yes the mouse is defenseless against sweaty palms.. Yes its a cool product
5,it is so good .it is far beyond my imagination. I'll come again.t is so good .it is far beyond my imagination. I'll come again.这个东西很不错，确实可以。包装都很好！国内的兄弟可以考虑买下！
1,It arrived without a USB dongle! Pretty useless without it!
5,I rarely say something positive about Microsoft but they did this keyboard perfectly.I wish their software division could figure out Windows 8.  morons.
1,I purchased in Nov. 2018 and now June 2018 and no longer works. You think spending nearly $100 on a keyboard and mouse it would last a lot longer. Will definitely get a similar one but not this one.
3,It doesn't work after 3 months
1,It broke after 2 months. It had issues with it not working all the time it would work for about an hour and then just stop working. You had to unplug and replug the fob. Now after 2 minths it just stop working. What a waste of money.
5,Easy setup. Keyboard has soft touch keys. Mouse has easy hold.
2,The product was in perfect condition except it was missing a "TAB" key...unacceptable.
5,My wrist has never felt better. Perfect angle. Best keyboard I have ever had.
3,Great product.
2,I have had this keyboard/mouse combo for two months and the mouse just quit working.  I changed batteries rebooted tried another usb port.  Nothing helped.  No tech support available and no online suggestions.  Very annoying!!
5,after 30 years of using keyboard and mouse these are my favorites..  the keypad is not good the battery dies quickly.
5,My wife loves it. I think it slants back to much but don't use it that often
3,Great keyboard. Mouse is funk-tastic and doesn't really get any more natural to use over time.
1,It was a great keyboard for one month.  Very comfortable lived up to my expectations.  However exactly 3 days after Amazon's return policy expires (30 days after delivery) and 1 day after I threw out the packaging it died.  The mouse flashes constantly and many of the key combinations no longer work.  So now I'm out $85 and for only one month of use...
5,I've been liking this a lot. I don't use the mouse as it's weird shaped but the rest of the kit is great
1,Microsoft does not have a replacement dongle you can purchase if you lose your dongle or if it is a defect.  You cannot use the keyboard or mouse without this.  Terrible.  And cannot return to Amazon.
3,I really like this keyboard but I wish the number pad was attached.
5,Fantastic keyboard and mouse I really like the feel.  The detached 10 key makes the product ideal.
1,Keyboard is defective. Goes through periods where it works and periods where it doesn't. Even when it is working there is a very long delay in processing what was typed which forces the user to stop and wait either to let it catch up or to realize that nothing was being processed.
5,I'm using right now.  Now complaints.  Works great. Comfortable.  Responsive keys.  I like the mouse and the detached keypad.
2,The USB connector is extremely fragile. It broke in less than 6 months. While the keyboard and mouse are in a pristine condition nothing work anymore. What a complete waste of $80!
5,The product is as described although had to get use to the design of the keyboard now really like the way it functions.
1,If you lose the little wireless transceiver dongle the entire keyboard must be replaced.  The keyboard and the dongle are pre-paired and there is no manual pair ability.I had the Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop set ruined the keyboard with coffee and attempted to replace the keyboard.  The keyboard will not pair with the same dongle used by the mouse that came with the original set.
5,After using this keyboard and mouse it's difficult to go back to the regular keyboard and mouse.  Saves on the wrist strain.
5,Very pleased with product was difficult to find.
5,I enjoy the wireless feature of the keyboard.  It is comfortable to use and lightweight.  the mouse works well also.
5,This is by far my favorite wireless keyboard it's got a great feel.
5,easy to use and the human body engineering desigh looks like good but it need some time to get used to the keyboard layout.
2,Great keyboard and mouse but the mouse wasn't completely new. There were obvious signs of usage even though we paid for a new one.
2,The mouse keeps losing connection.  It will stop working for hours at a time then suddently start working again for no apparent reason.  Batteries are fresh the mouse is close to the transmitter.  It makes no sense.  Seems to be judge a crappy product.
2,Worked awesome for about a week then it connected sometimes now it barely connect at all. Waste of money and no option to return through Amazon
5,Plug and play super simple to begin using right away - no downloading or installing necessary.
1,Worked great for about a month now NOTHING works! I have even went and replaced all of the batteries and nothing. This is very upsetting I loved this keyboard while it worked. I am even past the return date so I'm stuck losing the $$ along with not having a functional keyboard. I've even tried it on several PC's to make sure it wasn't just mine.
1,First the chip went out then my mouse stopped working... it works but I have to click it 4 to 5 times to get it to work.  Past warranty that's what I get for purchasing an expensive combo.  I don't suggest you purchase this unreliable considering my home computer gets very light use.
2,Love the keyboard and mouse but when the dongle goes dead you're out $100.  And I've had 2 dongles on 2 different keyboards/mice go out in under a year.
5,Product received new in the box and is performing as expected.
5,Quality keyboard and works great on the ergo side of things.
3,good feeling when I type the keyboard. but Function key is not good.
1,The keyboard is great but the number pad stopped working I just bought it in February I am trying to figure out how in the heck to contact Amazon because I bought it through them but of course there is no help but the FAQ's. I love the keyboard itself but you need the number paid when you are in office management. Do not buy.
5,Very awesome keyboard and mouse. So far I'm loving my new setup. Everything about this is well built. I don't have any complaints.
5,You really need to be able to handle a true ergo keyboard. If you can you will fall in love with this keyboard.....
1,Had this product for several months. It worked fine until it stopped working.  made several attempts to fix. new batteries. rebooting. reloading the software.  reinstall the drivers.  would work for 10 minutes then stop again.  reboot... would work for 20 minutes then stop...Threw it away.  going for a wired keyboard and mouse. Microsoft still can't build good products.
5,no problem here
5,I have one at work and like it so much I order one for home too.
5,Purchased for my wife she likes the setup especially the number pad.
5,Not inexpensive but works great.  Pleasure to use!
5,Very comfortable.
1,Buyer beware. The USB plug-in (required to recognize mouse/keyboard) is cheep and broke after two weeks of use. Yes I removed the wireless USB a few times but fell apart. And w/ out it you may as well throw the whole setup away as there is no driver to install to get a bluetooth signal to pick up the devices/pair them to your computer.
2,I was very disappointed because the number board stopped working after a couple of weeks and the space bar  doe not work the first time you hit it so I have a lot of errors that I have to go back and fix
5,It takes some getting used but once you get used to is the best
3,It take some getting used to.  Some of the keys stick!
1,I tried using this on a Surface and it was very problematic. The function toggle key would not work in the "function" mode and generates a lot of erroneous keystrokes if an application is open even when I wasn't pressing any keys. I'm not sure if it's the Bluetooth aspect or simply poor workmanship but this product is a failure - buyer beware!
5,This is a great product. Love the feel of the keyboard and how natural it feels to type on it.
5,Definitely ergonomic and like that's it's compact. Cleaner look and more space on the desktop
5,Best typing feel in an ergonomic design. Separated calculator keyboard minimizes desktop presence.
5,Works wonderfully
3,the number pad doesnt work but i dont really use other its great
5,These things have minimized my carpel tunnel systoms
3,Solid. Love the keyboard. Sad the number keypad doesn't last too long. Tried to replace battery reinstall drivers etc. but to no avail. I miss having a separate keypad. Won't buy this combo again but glad to still have the keyboard.
1,Purchased this as a gift for my mom and this wireless set has been nothing but a giant headache.  The Bluetooth connection is very flaky and unreliable.  I've had to fix the signal countless times when it would stop working after a while.  The keys also get stuck sometimes which causes problems trying the use the computer.  Not recommended!
1,Comfortable keyboard great modern design.Worked great for about 3 months until it suddenly stopped working altogether. If I replace the batteries it works for about 60 seconds and then dies again. The 10-key pad and mouse still work fine.Amazon's return/replace button is gone and says "return window closed on ..."
5,It works great
5,Excellent product no complaints.  Will definitely look to buy from seller again!
5,excellent mouse and keyboard
5,Good product for the price
5,I love this keyboard mouse and ten key pad.  It has significantly reduced the strain in my wrists.  Great product!
3,Really takes getting used to but in the end it is good.
1,not worth the money I would return but window is closed to return. Don't waste your money
1,Ba!!ery was comple ely drained when I received. some of he keys are no funcionalBy now you mus have unders ood hat some of  he keys are not functional.POOR product. would like  o hear from the seller.---the replacement has s defective keyboard and it stopped working after 1 week.
1,I had a $79 Microsoft Wireless keyboard and mouse combo.  The USB toggle that communicated with them and the computer broke. Called Microsoft and guess what?  They don't sell the individual part - you have to buy the whole $70 Keyboard and Mouse unit - they wouldn't even discount it for me.  Last time I buy hardware from Microsoft!
1,Worked fine for a day and then wouldn’t power on. Changed out the batteries but that didn’t fix the issue. Ended up returning the keyboard.
1,This is the 2nd Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Wireless keyboard I've had to buy in the past six months! I've had this model before and had no problems with it. Now I've been through two. I think you are making them cheaper.
2,It's very good for typing long documents but when it comes to editing - it fails miserably because of improper placement of the arrow keys
5,This combination of input devices work great for me and I recommend them as comfortable to use and effective in response to the user's actions.
1,The layout and tactile feel is different enough for typing to be slow and tentative.  After six weeks the keyboard space button broke and is past the window to return to Amazon.com.  The mouse is marginal at best and is not in the same league as my Logitech combo I'm replacing after four years.  Not recommended at all.
1,It works great...for a while.  Very soon the keys on the keyboard will rub off and you won't be able to see the letters.  If you contact Microsoft support they will say in a thick accent "please contact the amazon for keyboard".  Of course the Amazon website will tell you it's ineligible for a return.
1,The USB connector will easy break. It broke after two months. Now neither Amazon nor Microsoft is willing to replace this for me. I have had three of these so far since they are ergonomically designed; however I have had a similar issue with them too. I will not buy this again.
5,Works right out of the box
5,Best ergo keyboard on the market.
1,Very disappointing.  The space bar needs to be pounded on to be affective as well as most of the other keys. I really like the more compact size but this does not make up for the that it simply does not work properly.
2,I've had multiple employees get back to me letting me know that it stops working. I would recommend do get a different keyboard. I currently work in our equipment procurement department and we're looking to make a switch to a different keyboard.
5,works great as advertised
2,Worked great for 4 months. After that keyboard stopped working all of a sudden. Mouse still works but pretty much useless if keyboard doesn't work.
5,Awesome keyboard and mouse.
3,Lighted keys would have helped. The design otherwise is excellent.
5,Just as described. Happy with purchase. Would buy from seller again.
2,Great keyboard except the keys stick on the number pad making typing very inconsistent and frustrating. I would no buy again.
3,Its comfortable but the wireless connection is spotty.
5,A good value at a good price!!!
5,Very convenient.  Can move the mouse and numbers anywhere special when calculating your documents.
1,I purchased this item on 11 Feb 2018 and on 24 Jun 2018 it died so I changed all 3 sets of batteries and it still does not work. What a waste of money.....I would not recommend this product.
5,Fantastic.  Shallow chiclet keys take a little getting used to but love them now.
2,I returned the first one because the backspace key didn't work. Now the replacement keyboard won't connect. Changed batteries and tried on three different laptops. Kb and number key pad won't connect. Returning for refund.
5,I love this keyboard...
2,I've had this keyboard for one month and it has stopped working properly. I've replaced the batteries twice and it continues to freeze up.  This is unacceptable.
1,Loved this keyboard until mine suddenly stopped responding at all nothing has helped and I can see its an issue with the keyboard... expected it to last longer for the price
5,It took a day to get use to but I love using this keyboard now and feel that it is really helping.
3,no caps lock num lock or scroll lock lights
1,USB receiver broke less than two months after I got it (it sticks way out from your laptop) and I was told Microsoft wouldn't replace it. 80 bucks for 50 days of use and now it needs to go in the trash.
1,WARNING!!!! If you lose or break the usb receiver you will need to completely replace keyboard and mouse. Yes you read correct. I've used this setup for less than one month and the usb receiver broke. Now I am out more than $80.
1,While the keyboard looks nice and it's great on an ergonomics standpoint the batteries keep getting loose. It might not be an issue if you want a prop in your next highschool play but if you use the keyboard at all beware you'll be pausing to reinsert your batteries.
1,This product was great until the USB device stopped working 11 months after we purchased this. Have called Microsoft to see if they can help only to be passed back and forth between unhelpful departments. Hoping that we can get this product working again. Please help!
5,Excellent product.Layout of keyboard makes it very simple to use.
1,I like the keyboard and mouse themselves the ergonomic aspect and aesthetic etc. But the receiver gave up. I replaced the batteries 3 times thinking it was that then realized it's not. Replacing with a different brand/product.
5,Great product just as described!
1,Various letters stopped workin (like the letter that I tried to type at the end of "workin." Looks ood (please insert seventh letter of the alphabet before the first "o" in "ood") but cheaply made. The layout for the delete button and the arrows makes no sense. Microsoft obviously does not care much about its keyboard business.
2,Enjoyed the keyboard the primary key I use no longer works when trying to Shift+X. Have to hit the CAPs lock key just to get the 'x' to capitalize.Poor product that isn't reliable for the price...
5,Best keyboard I've ever used. Only took me a few days of use to get accustomed to it.
5,This is the perfect replacement to my 20 year old natural keyboard & MS mouse.
5,This is the best keyboard I've used. So Easy on the wrist. I am very pleased
5,Love this product it does take some getting use to.
5,[...]You can change the mouse's window button into forward button.This keyboard and mouse is very good for long computer work.
5,Client loves it. Need to order another.
5,The design is insightful and has helped a great deal. The design is modern sleek and lightweight. The setup took only minutes.
5,Really awesome product. USB Stick is a bit big but it works great.
5,Considering a seconds purchase for my other computer...great product.
1,This keyboard and mouse was great when I bought it but after about 2 months the connectivity to the usb sensor started failing. Now  4 months later it has completely stopped working. Really unfortunate considering this isn't a cheap wireless keyboard.
5,PErfect
5,Very good and ergonomic keyboard.
5,I have never been able to type so fast with so few errors as with this keyboard. Add Bluetooth compatibility to make it perfect.
5,My favorite Keyboard I've owned to date.
5,Bought a second one for a Christmas Present! very nice use it on Windows 10
1,My Bluetooth Dongle is was not working after 45 day of return.I called to Microsoft support they asked me to return the product and i need to take care of the shipping cost  which is so awful why a costumer needs to take care of  shipping cost for a defective Bluetooth Dongle
2,Great keyboard but the USB broke after only a few months
5,Good ergonomic keyboard. Its lightweight. Nice buttons. I like how the number pad is seperate. Allows for better spacing on the desktop.
5,The best accessories you can buy it is comfortable and great for small desks! I would buy it as a gift too!
1,I loved the feel and function of the keyboard and mouse but was extremely dissatisfied to find I cannot purchase a USB replacement.  Hoping I can return since it's <1yr; if not it's completely useless!
5,Easy to set up.  Key spacing is slightly different than wired version but easy to get comfortable with.
2,it only worked for 8 months and then stop working
5,Perfect exactly what I expected.  Easy set up!
1,Terrible keyboard. The receptor doesn’t communicate with the keyboard and therefore I’m unable to use it. I tried all of my USB ports and I tried it on several other computers.
5,Best keyboard I have ever used.
5,Quality of the product is better than I expected. And it works great.
1,The mouse stopped working under a year. Also the first letter had to be typed multiple times. I tray to make MSFT validate the 3 year warranty but good luck trying to find out how to return it
5,I love this keyboard. So comfortable and easy to use. Made working from home wonderful.
1,I just have a negative review to a Microsoft Sculpt keyboard but the review was associated with a Dell Monroe that I had bought at the same time. Amazon needs to get their act and their website together. Don't buy the keyboard! But do but a Dell monitor - they're great!
5,The keyboard and mouse feels very good and comfortable to use. Very ergonomic. Though if it is backlit would be much better
1,But outside the Amazon "product support" window.  In other words touh luck....or rather tough luck because the g key only works every other press if that
1,Item was used and not in working order when we received the box.The box had been opened and the mouse was not working.There were scuff marks on the bottom of the mouse and keyboard.
5,Amazing. Very nice and good to use
5,takes some time to getting used to the shape and style of the keyboard. the mouse is very good as well
1,I've had my keyboard for 4 months it's not working - at all.  Changed the battery - no good.  Now I'm back on the market to purchase a different keyboard.
5,Best keyboard yet. Great looking and well made. Love the mouse; it works fast and no mousepad needed.
5,Best keyboard & mouse there is
5,One of the best keyboards I've ever used.
5,Great combo.  Does take some times to get used to though.
5,Best keyboard out there. Incredible on your joints!
5,Feels great and love both mouse and keyboard on one tiny input device that stores inside the mouse
1,Do not buy this! You lose the little transceiver and it's toast! I left it in the laptop they replaced at work. Microsoft will not replace it!
5,The best one I ever bought!
1,usb port died and there is no way to get a replacement part without purchasing the whole package of keyboard and mouse.  NEVER RECOMMEND buying this product.  Purchased 2 and they both stopped working in less than a year
5,Great for those with petite hands as keys aren't spread too far apart like similar Microsoft keyboards.
2,mouse is not as accurate or responsive as id expect
5,Love the feel of the keys the wireless 10 key and the mouse. Couldn't be happier with this purchase.
5,it is what i have been looking for~comfortable and convenient keyboard.however this mouse is just normal and soso.
1,The left-click mouse button closes tabs whenever I click them and also has trouble with some other clicking I have no idea how to fix this please help.Love the keyboard already used it for years and I think it truly helped reduce strain on my wrists.
2,IT does not last very long.  I am very disappointed.
2,I don't like the mouse & 10-key.  It is hard to control the mouse and the 10-key numbers hard to press. i like the keyboard... it is excellent.
1,Attachment that connects to laptop broke. unit doesn't work anymore. Poor design - sticks out to far - poorly made
5,excellent
5,Coworker thinks this is amazing; good thing because I bought it for them to use!
5,LOVE IT
5,Will never go back to an old flat keyboard.  This one rocks!
1,Loved this till the dongle got bent 3 months after purchase and everything stopped working. Microsoft does NOT offer replacement dongles and this one sticks out pretty far. The only solution according to Microsoft support is to buy another one. No thanks Microsoft. Make a better product!
5,Love this keyboard combo changed they way I type and hands never hurt anymore!
2,The keyboard and mouse were used and contained dead batteries. The keyboard clearly shows signs of wear and tear. Purchase from a different seller than the Prime retailer.
1,I feel like the product was tampered on when I received it. I found scratches on the keyboard. The mouse was working well.
2,it was too hard to get used to after using a traditional keyboard for so many years.  Also the mouse felt to big and bulky to me.
2,Stopped working after 2 months. The fob (dongle) shorted. Would have been great if it came with a longer warranty / return policy.
5,This was my second one - great system...
3,space keyboard.
2,The "F" (function' keys are definitely NOT good. You need to much pression they are like button instead of keyboard keys. These "F" touch are a NO go.
3,Cool
1,Horrible product. The arm / wrist support area wore out after only a couple of WEEKS. I wish I could return this product. The worst.
5,Love it
5,Very comfortable keyboard and mouse. Materials seem high quality. Would buy again
1,The separated small keyboard was broken within 3 days!No any reaction except red light flashing when I press it.It's an absolutely new sets and I am now really worry about the quality and lifetime of the mouse and the another half of keyboard!
5,This thing is balls-to-walls nuts-bared awesome. Can't go wrong with this meaty piece of virile tech. BBBOOOOOOOMMMMMM!
2,The mouse and keyboard both are laggy.
1,Product seems to work well except for the mouse. I requested a replacement. The replacement came to me in an undamaged shipping box but the Microsoft box inside was already opened damaged and the contents were definitely used. Very disappointed. Everything is being returned....
1,I WOULD NEVER BUY THIS PRODUCT EVER!!!!! IT BROKE DOWN IN 6-8 MOS... IT IS THE MOST HORRIBLE INVESTMENT I HAVE EVER MADE. THANK GOODNESS I BOUGHT INSURANCE ON IT OTHERWISE I WOULD BE STUCK.. IF YOU SEE THIS ITEM RUN THE OTHER WAY!!!
2,very bulky and the toggle broke within a week
2,Does not work in my computer but works in another computers but it is impossible get support.
2,I miss the old wireless keyboard and mouse combo in the Microsoft series. This one is already showing signs of wear after 3 months.
2,Crossing over with one hand to the other side of the keyboard is difficult for us hunt and peck typists.Escape key is too small.
5,I'm in love with this keyboard and mouse
5,Good enough to convert the second system also
1,For Home and Work And all of them have lost key's  I give up on this product
1,worked find until the cheap little USB dongle broke when unplugging it  Microsoft does not offer replacement USB dongles so now the entire system is trash.
2,Very good keyboard but the usb dongle broke down in 5 months
5,Mouse and keyboard are both very comfortable to use. I like the keys a lot.
1,I had problems with several of the keys sticking about two years after purchase. MS agreed it had a three-year warranty on the keyboard but said that all warranty service could be done only through Amazon. MS refused to provide any warranty service.
1,Is amazing it helped me a lot the connector got broken and I had to put it in the garbage no one helped me to get it fixed. Not the seller or Microsoft because I'm Chile and I got it in USA. Annoying!!!!
5,I love this keyboard and mouse works great!
5,Great design
5,Best keyboard I've ever used! No more pain in my wrists.
5,Great keyboard and mouse. Very happy with it.
1,The USB lost its cover and now the mouse and keyboard no longer work!  Is there a way to order a new USB?
5,Fantastic keyboard for anyone who spends ALL day on the computer.
5,Absolutely love this set up.
5,I absolutely love this keyboard set I have purchased 2 one for work and one for home!
5,In this article I very love this is a very pleasant shopping delivery protection is very perfect.
1,Mouse pointer jumps around and it is impossible to click on anything. I have tired on many different surfaces and the same result. So disappointed!
5,Great product. High quality. Comes with separate number keyboard and all work wirelessly great.
5,Super cool I really didnt know what to expect. But everything met my expectations I would recommend it.
5,I liked this enough that when I poured tea in it I bought a second one. Oops!
2,The keyboard is excellent but the mouse is used with scratches in  bottom.
5,Well-built and good wireless connectivity through the one USB connection required for the mouse keyboard and 10 key pad together.
1,Dirty and  used with unsealed packaging. Greasy hand prints on back.
5,Happy with my purchase!
5,Awesome for my carpal tunnel.  Wish it had backlights - hard to see at night.
1,the padded part of the keyboard is too wide - it digs into my wristscan't imagine why anyone would give this anything more than a horrible ratingi used it for an hour and my wrists were killing me
2,the key board is not working - purchased in Ocotber 23  2015- not working from April 1 2016
2,Not as good as the natural keyboard. The M key broke after a couple of months. I had to throw it away.
5,Love it!  I have Rheumatoid Arthritis and it helps me to type much better.
2,The keys stopped responding after a few weeks of moderate use. It's a decent enough keyboard for the first few weeks though.
5,Amazing
1,Worked well for less than a year until the usb dongle wore out from plugging it in and out of laptop.  No option to replace only dongle.
5,Awesome! I have had it now for a couple of months and no regrets at all
5,Excellent keyboard.  Not real fond of the mouse but it is growing on me.
1,This product worked for a day. I haven't been able to get it working since. I had an earlier model and it worked for years.  The mouse movement is inconsistent and does not flow or work properly. Bummed.
1,I have bought two of these products and withon the first three months of use they stop working intermittently. new batteries only fix the problem for about two minutes. clearly a flaw in quality.
5,Love love love the ensemble!
1,Besides being too complicated to use mine just stopped working. Better quality better value alternatives out there.
1,Can't leave a decent review. The USB dongle was not shipped with my item and therefore nothing worked. On top of that the Microsoft box appeared DOA and was re-taped with standard packing tape. Very disappointed.
1,It was very hard to use.  I'd tried but put it back in the box since it's hard to use.
2,broke after 1 month
1,The usb  port also stopped functioning within a year
5,Excellent product. Simple to install on Windows 7. Feels great. Easy to use.
5,Great product and price.  Shipped super quick.
1,Same problem multiple people have had worked fine for about a year. Now it's a paperweight. Changed batteries and location of receiver nothing works.  If you just want a keyboard for a year this will work.
5,Very comfortable and work beautifully. Nice sturdy but lightweight set.
5,Very comfortable and easy to setup.
1,I tried getting used to this keyboard.  Its too big and bulky.  Doesn't always connect.  Its passed the exchange time.
5,Design is excelent
5,so nive
1,Was not like new missing correct pieces will not work
1,Worked only for 1.5 weeks then the keyboard stopped responding.  Save yourself the time of dealing with MS tech support only to have your hopes dashed.  Neat looking but total POS.
1,although it looks really cool it is really a masterful pain in my ass.  I can't adjust the settings because their own software doesn't work on their operating system so everything is jerky and spastic.
5,Amazingly great keyboard for people with any orthopedic problems.
5,Best wireless natural keyboard ms currently makes.
5,Love this. I use it at home and bought myself one for work too.
5,It is taking getting used to but this is the best keyboard I have ever used.
1,Worked well for about 12 months. Now the mouse doesn't click unless you press quite hard.
5,Ergonomic and comfortable.
5,I LOVE my keyboard and mouse set!!  Unique ergonomic and sleek.
1,Loved the mouse and keyboard while it lasted which was 4 months to the day. Not cool
1,This keyboard chews batteries like a set a week. Seems that some of the keys stick occasionally as well it stops doing it after I press another key. I wish I could return it.
5,Love my new keyboard
1,3 months after my purchase (outside of return window) the USB stopped working!  Left with an expensive mouse and keyboard that doesn't work!
1,junk died on me. Thank goodness for amazon seller was awesome and reimbursed full amount. dont buy this.Also usb port is HUGE and flimsy not good for any kind of mobile device.
5,Love this keyboard.  Much quieter than my last one but works like a charm!!
1,Received this item on May 4th as of June 6 it no longer functions.  This is the second unit we purchased that failed within six months.  Buyer beware.
1,Product worked for 5 months and stopped working-have tech contact MS for replacement as it exceed 30 day return via Amazon
5,Great product great timing.
5,My love for typing only grew with this keyboard set.
1,Some keys stop working after 8 months; and the light in middle of two space bars flashes red even if I put brand new batteries in this convinces me it's a product failure.
5,Keyboard has an excellent ergonomic design. Love it.
1,Letters don’t line up where they should. Trashed
1,USB keeps breaking. I've owned two of these and both of them had the USB break. Very frustrating and there's no replacement for this part other than ordering a new keyboard.
5,Just what I wanted!
5,this was a gift for my son he loves it.
1,Replaced the same model that failed before. This one worked for 6 weeks and died just like the other. The mouse and keypad from both still work fine. Both keyboards just failed!
2,How I wish it could be a mechanical keyboard while life is tough...
1,Do not buy this. If you lose the receiver it cannot be replaced
2,it's functional but there is an appearance defect on the mouse I recieved.
5,Works great and helps with my wrists
5,Perfect so far. =)
1,This keyboard is the WORST!The number key is always lacking.If I type too fast it doesn't log everything I key inTHE WORST!
1,The USB dongle for this keyboard is extremely cheap. Mine broke wihtin 2 days of having it after it got caught while trying to put my laptop into my bag.
5,Awesome keyboard!!
1,Worthless piece of junk.  Worked for about two weeks and then broke down couldn't get replacement or any help. Don't waste your money like I did.
1,I loved this keyboard until it died on me. Simply will not work. Very frustrating for an expensive keyboard. (Plus the 10-key has goofy top keys.)
5,Perfect!!! Now i dont have any problem in my hands hahaha
1,I love the keyboard but I have to change batteries weekly.  It is way to often.  I don't know if mine is defective or it eats batteries.
5,Very comfortable!
5,AWESOME
5,Comfortable to use. Supports the wrists. Very pleased.
1,The left click on the mouse stopped working after 14 months.
5,Lightweight quiet comfortable.  You can easily make all your co-workers jealous!
1,Totally crapped out on me.  Keys stopped working after a month then it started to trigger bing search repeatedly.  2 supplied batteries died within 2 months.
5,Excellent keyboard and mouse setup just as described couldn't be more happier!
5,Keeps my wrists happy!
5,This is a nice keyboard my wife just loves it
1,This product worked great and I loved it. But after 5 months non of the pieces work.

5,Absolutely love this product.

1,After six months several of the letters quit working making the keyboard unusable.
5,Great product for Ergonomic needs and it was at good price too.
1,Changed the batteries. Several chats with Microsoft couldn't identify the problem.
1,I have loved this product and have had it for approximately 5 months and all of the sudden one of the keys has stopped working.
5,Like it very much going to buy another one for girlfriend！
5,now I can use my laptop with out wrist pains.
1,I received a used mouse with this keyboard as you can see in the pictures the base and the buttons are in bad condition
5,excellent but lost the USB receiver. you sell it separately?
5,Excellent
1,I lost the usb transceiver and called MS customer service they told me they can do nothing to help.
1,The function keys were getting stuck so I had to return this. Replaced with a mechanical keyboard KUL87 and could not be happier.
1,I did not receive the USB with it to connect the items. Please reach out to me to resolve this.BestChad
5,I should have purchased it much earlier.
1,Pretty much the usb dongle broke after 5-10 uses.
1,Doesn't work. It worked one time for about a half an hour and then quit.
1,Arrived missing the required USB non working device.  Looked like careless packing to me.  Dead on arrival.  Pain in the....
1,lose or break the transceiver and you have to buy a whole new unit for what amounts to a 25 cent part.
5,good
1,Received late and it is missing USB key .. useless and I am very disappointed returning it back.
1,The wireless receiver stopped working a few days after it arrived. Awaiting a replacement from MS but it is on back order.

5,Love it!
5,Great if you type alot
1,Only worked for two months then half the keyboard conveniently stopped working right after the return window closed. Look else where.
1,This product worked for about 2 weeks with my MacBook Air and then just stopped. Was so disappointed.
5,Makes it effortless to type
5,I love it
1,I arrived damaged and Microsoft does not take the guarantee in my country because I bought on Amazon from USA.
1,sucks. clumsy. gave it away. gave it 3 weeks. couldn't assimilate. i'm very dexterous. perhaps different strokes for different folks.
1,would have been awesome if it didn't break after 3 months of ownership with no return eligibility past 30 days.
5,Comfortable easy to set up. Long battery life!
5,I now own two of these. Great keyboard and mouse.

4,I work as a developer so I spend all of my time in front of a computer using both a keyboard and mouse. Its important to me to go home at the end of the day without shoulder neck back or wrist pain above all else. This purchase is getting me one step closer to that goal and even after two days of use I'm starting to feel more relaxed during the day.I can type around 95-100 WPM on a regular keyboard. The last time I checked this value was on a Logitech G710+ which is a mechanical keyboard with smooth cherry MX keys. While I do notice a difference in the feel of this keyboard I don't miss the mechanical switches as the difference in feel is completely outweighed by the comfort and flexibility that this keyboard allows me. I haven't yet gotten accustomed to the keyboard completely (I have always typed the "b" key with my right hand and can no longer do that) I'm able to type just as fast as I was with a traditional layout. I can perform better in web games like zt.ype and was in the 90WPM range on the first day of using the keyboard. I feel that once I get used to it I'll be able to surpass my previous scores. My fingers feel like they have a better flow to the keys they are trying to press. I believe this is due to the variable size of the keys. With a regular keybaord most keys are exactly the same size and fit within a specific grid. With this keyboard the keys are sized and positioned based on their relative position to your hand in the home row. The wave build keeps my hands wrists and arms in a relaxed position.One of my favorite things about this keyboard is that it sits comfortably in my lap. Instead of having to be concerned about where my body is positioned when sitting upright to have my hands on the keyboard my hands can sit where they naturally would in my lap and I can relax into my chair.The major downside of this keyboard and the reason I knocked off a star is due to the fn/f-key switch. While I understand that most of the time the f-keys are not used by the general public I don't think this was the most elegant solution to the problem. I need to be able to hit certain f-keys and I also want to lower or raise my music volume without having to check the position of a switch. Its important to be able to do this quickly at work as I sometimes wear headphones and need to turn down the volume while coding when someone walks in to my office.The mouse will take a little while to get used to but it immediately feels more comfortable than my (quite expensive) Logitech MX Master. The improved position of the thumb rest immediately helps my hand feel more relaxed. Having to turn my hand to the horizontal in order to use most mouses eventually causes me to feel strain in my wrist. Allowing my hand to sit as it naturally would if I had my hand on my arm rest removes the strain that builds throughout the day for me.I don't feel that the keys are too easy to activate or too hard to activate. I think they sit right in a good sweet spot. However I have trained my fingers to have a light touch as it improves speed and reduces strain over time. Not everyone has taken the time to do this and not everyone knows how to type without looking at the keyboard.

4,This is my favorite keyboard of all time but sadly cannot give it 5 stars because of a few problems.THE GOOD1. The keys feel great having the perfect snap to them!2. The battery life is incredible. I've been using mine for months now and running on only two AAA batteries I have yet to change them!3. Key locations of the keys I use most are perfect: Arrow Keys Letter Keys Tab Shift Control Alt Enter Backspace.4. Ergonomically fantastic. Lightweight. Wireless. High Quality. Fits on my lap perfectly as I type or play games!5. Separate Numeric Keypad is very handy. Often I use it exactly as I would use a calculator. Also handy for 2-player gaming!6. The magnetic battery cover on the back of the keyboard feels like magic. It is lots of fun to pull it off and let it snap back into place. Weird!THE BAD1. Windows 7 issues. I had extreme problems installing Windows 7 with this keyboard attached and for months had no idea that the keyboard was the culprit. Once I figured it out simply removing the keyboard dongle during installation solve the problem. Yet I still have Windows 7 issues especially with Internet Explorer and I suspect the keyboard is still causing issues because my computer ran flawlessly until I added this keyboard. Having said that I love this keyboard so much that I am willing to put up with quite a few problems in order to keep using it. I find it very strange that a Microsoft Keyboard would have issues in a Microsoft OS. This problem is why I cannot give this keyboard 5 stars.2. The Left Shift Key. On my keyboard the Left Shift Key snaps like normal but does not always give me my capital letters like it should. I have to be extra firm in pressing it to ensure I get a capital letter. I find myself having to correct capitalization mistakes quite a bit because of it. (For some reason when I learned to type I became trained to never use the Right Shift Key so a wonky Left Shift Key is a big deal to me). I have no idea if all of these keyboards have this issue or just the particular one I bought.THE TRADEOFFS1. In order to reduce the size of the keyboard the right side of the keyboard has been rearranged meaning the Insert/Delete Home/End and PgUp/PgDn keys are in different positions than I'm used to. I do not use these a whole lot so it generally doesn't matter to me but at those moments when I do want to use them it becomes more of a chore than it used to be.2. Also to reduce keyboard size the Escape key is now too small. Although it is still easy to find because of it's position I often find myself hitting the ~ key instead whenever I reach for it. I have never used the ~ key in my entire life (except now to write this review) so I think that key should have been made smaller to allow for a larger ESC key.3. I could not find this keyboard without the included mouse. The mouse is perfectly fine but I just didn't need it because I already had one that I really like. On the other hand I've actually found a couple of uses for having a second mouse attached. First when helping my son learn how to use programs on the computer it is handy to have my own mouse so I can take over the pointer when I want to. Second when my other mouse's battery dies it is handy to be able to simply grab this other one instead of having to plug my other mouse in immediately.
5,awesome
5,so nice@@!!
5,great
4,I've used Microsoft ergonomic keyboards in the past and believe that they do help with pain. Long ago I was having wrist pain and used the first generation of this configuration and my pain went away. That could be coincidence but there is some logic to the design.This new setup is a very nice package. The keyboard has the split wave configuration that takes some getting used to but after you do it is a very natural way to type. I almost feel like it could be even more split for me but even as it is I feel less fatigue in my wrists and even less cramping in my shoulders. The keyboard can be used with or without a magnetic part that raises the front of the keyboard so it tilts backwards. I am mixed on that. I can see why it makes sense but it is slowing down my typing. I've only had it for three weeks and it is getting more comfortable but when I have a lot to type I take off the plastic part and type with it flat. I'll give it some more time because I'd like to use it as I can see the arch of my wrist is better with it on. It just puts your forearms in a higher position which is odd.Functionally the keys are nice (soft and silent) but not a very deep throw. This has its own USB dongle and is not Bluetooth. It works very well (no skips or drops) but will use a USB port and a small thing will remain sticking out if you use this on a laptop.I like the separate number pad. This was sort of an throwaway but it turns out to have its benefits. It has a button to bring up the calculator so you press this button and you have a calculator with a calculator keypad. It sounds trivial but it makes it much easier to use in this format so it is a pretty good plus if you do many calculations on the fly.The mouse is another story. I must admit that I typically use my mouse with my left hand at work and with my right at home. (I am left handed but my family computers are set up for right handers.) The mouse is very big. It is like moving a puck about. I appreciate the position they want your hand in (on its side almost like a handshake) but my hand doesn't want to do that. The left-click is sort of centered and the right click on the side. It is OK but I find myself using it as a regular mouse and not in the ergonomic position so I sometimes miss-click.There are two buttons by your thumb. One is to bring up the start screen (which is of little help in Windows 7). I never remember shortcuts on mouse buttons. Two buttons is enough for me. The other mouse button which is pressed horizontally towards your palm takes you back in a browser. The problem though is that you can't press this button without also right-clicking (remember that button is moved far to the right). On my mouse the right-click is softer than this button so there is really no convenient way to press this button. Perhaps a natural right-hander would benefit more from the mouse but I think some of the flaws (its size its dramatic new position and the difficulty with the extra buttons) make the mouse a little disappointing.Overall I think it is a well-made and nice product with may good features. If you are worried about hand position and joint pain I think there are merits to this configuration and you might want to give it a try. The keyboard at least is worth it and you may have better luck with the mouse especially if you are naturally right-handed.
4,I have been using ergonomic keyboards since Microsoft's first Natural Keyboard in 1995. Until the Sculpt came along my standard for the last several years was the Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000.I still like the 4000 but it's big. Typical keyboard drawers cannot accommodate both the 4000 keyboard and a mouse pad. That's been an annoyance since I got my last desk about four years ago.The Sculpt keyboard is as nice to use as the 4000 though you do have to get used to a new arrangement of Insert Delete Home End PgUp PgDn. But I find I do like the new arrangement a bit better as it makes Delete bigger and that's the key out of that group I use the most.The Sculpt also fixes my biggest annoyance with the 4000 which is the default usage of the function keys to Help Undo etc. I use Visual Studio a lot and function keys are essential to get any work done with it. I've long since learned to go to the settings and fix things to stick on regular function keys but it's not very intuitive to do it. The Sculpt has a toggle switch right on the keyboard in the upper right. Easy as pie and easy to switch for the occasional times I need the alternate usage of those keys.The function keys are smaller and not as well separated from other keys as with the 4000. This is probably my biggest complaint with the Sculpt. I'd like to see a 1/4 inch or so separation from the row of keys for numbers/symbols to reduce accidental presses on them when going for function keys.The other things make up for that. The ability to position the number pad anywhere for example means its out of the way until I need it. The number pad also has a slightly better layout with the backspace key more conveniently placed and bigger.I don't like the Sculpt mouse as well as my old Ergonomic 6000 mouse which is not made anymore. It's as good as any other ergonomic mouse made these days though so I'm OK with it.I like the feel even though it has less throw on the keys than the 4000.Bottom line is that there's no need to throw away your 4000 unless you have the same space problem that I have. In that case the Sculpt will give you just about everything you like about the 4000 with some improvements and a couple of minor drawbacks.*** Update 19 Dec 2016 ***I have to take back my positive comments about the Sculpt Mouse. As I said above I did not like it as well as other ergonomic mice but not long after that review I started using that machine more for routine web browsing and noticed a big issue. The Back button is placed right where the tip of the thumb should be and it is way too easy to click. I found myself regularly hitting it while just moving the mouse thus losing my page. This was so annoying that I replaced it with another wired ergonomic mouse I originally bought for gaming. One star off for this design flaw in the mouse.
2,Work bought this for me during work from home of Covid. I loved the keyboard and mouse ergonomics for that I give 5 Stars. However the dongle itself broke on me and unfortunately you cannot buy a replacement dongle like you can with the Logitech devices.So for the reason that a single damaged dongle would make the entire set useless is why this only gets 2 stars. Microsoft needs to find a way for a universal dongle that can be programmed like Logitech.
5,While Microsoft didn't get Windows 8 right I'm almost tempted to say that they are the Apple Computer of ergonomic keyboards. A prime example is this keyboard. Shortly after purchasing my   Fellowes Microban Split Design Keyboard Black (98915)         I stumble across the Microsoft Sculpt. I was very turned off by the price but then discovered that I could buy it for less without the mouse (which most people complain about) by ordering version known as   Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard for Business (5KV-00001)        . So here I am today typing this review with it. Here are my impressions:THE GOOD:It absolutely has a better feel than any keyboard I've every used. The Fellowes which intend to keep as a backup was excellent and I still highly recommend it. But I like the short-travel chiclet style this one offers. It allows me to type faster and more accurately particularly as it gets toward the end of the day when I'm running out of gas.Ergonomically off the scale. I'm typing on it right now using the "riser" that lifts the front so that it's slanted downward from from to back. This seemingly non-intuitive angle actually places your hands at angle that keeps your wrists straight. It is the perfect angle for the way in which my elbows are resting on my armrests.Ease of setup. I just removed the little tags from the battery compartment as viola I was underway after plugging it on and rebooting. Plus there were no drivers that I had to manually install. Another review complained about the drivers but I know not what he refereth too.No Weird Awkward Mouse. Many reviewers complained about having to pay considerably more for mouse they didn't want and didn't need. I'm glad I found this version...  Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard for Business (5KV-00001)        Separate Numerical Keyboard. I don't use the numerical keys that often so it's nice to have more space on my desk. One nifty thing is that because the center of the keyboard is elevated above the surface it rests on you can actually slide your numerical keyboard under it.You Can Hold the Numerical Keyboard in Your Hand Like a Calculator. Might seem redundant but yesterday when I picked up the numerical keys in my left and tapped in some numbers with my right...it was pretty magical.The Infamous Riser That Has Surprising Benefits. As mentioned the keyboard has a riser that you can attach to raise the front of the keyboard. Initially this may be awkward for most people but once you try it and adjust the height of your chair...you might understand the rationale of this. For me as stated be at least one other reviewer it not only puts my wrist and elbows in a more natural position but it makes me sit up straight in my chair. That's quite an accomplishment given that I'm probably the king of all slouchers.Function keys. Many reviewers have stated that the Function Keys are more like buttons. I agree that that they're smaller than function keys on other keyboards but I have not found that that the keypress feel or reach differs from that of other keyboards I've used. In other words it works fine for me and is a non-issue.You can place this keyboard on top of a laptop keyboard without trigger errant keystrokes. Because this has a concave bottom I am able to place this on top of my top keyboard without triggering the keys.THE BADNon-standard battery for numerical keypad. Did they really have to use a non-standard watch battery for the numerical keyboard?Can't test before buying. Before buying I checked the usual places like BestBuy but could not find any stores that carry it so that I can try it. Consequently I had to Google many more reviews than I normally like to before I felt confident about ordering from Amazon. Fortunately things worked out.A FEW OTHER THINGS: It's quiet. Looks like work of art particularly next to my   Kensington Slimblade Trackball USB 2.0 for PC and Mac K72327US        .TWO WEEK UPDATE: After some negative reviews that followed mine I decided to report back for those who are still interested in trying this keyboard. Overall as long as it holds together I have nothing to change about what I have written above. I have no qualms about changing my review to the negative if issues pointed out by other reviewers such as "sticking function keys" "key's falling off" "laggy response" etc start happening to me. But so far it continues to be great.
4,Let me first recommend that you read the Cornell Ergonomics page on keyboards.  Google Cornell ergonomics go to “Guides and Information” and then “Computer Keyboard Design.”  It’s not a pretty web page but there is a good overview of ergonomic keyboards.  I’ll also point you to the Wirecutter review which is worth reading too (this keyboard is their #1 recommendation).I’ll start by saying that this is not a perfect ergonomic keyboard but I believe it is the best one out there.  In the end of the day if you are a business professional who needs a keyboard that is comfortable and natural for all day typing then this is your product.  It really doesn’t travel well though.  You may notice that many of the cons I list are about how this works well as a desktop keyboard but has it’s problems for a laptop setupI’ve attached a bunch of pictures and compare this product to my existing setup which is an old Apple wireless keyboard (pre lightning charging) and Logitech Wireless Anywhere Mouse MX.My personal laptop is an Apple my work machine is a Windows this product works equally well one both.THE GOOD:  - The keys are chiclet style (like laptop keys rather than the long-travel keys on conventional desktop setups) with longer travel than most.  Some people are disappointed by this like the Wirecutter guys but I prefer it.  It may be for this reason that this keyboard was designed with a longer travel (deeper press) than most chiclet keyboards.  Personally I would prefer a shorter travel akin to an apple product but I don’t overly mind.  If you are dead set on more traditional keys they Microsoft has an older version of this that may fit you needs.  - I love the detached number pad.  I think this would be worth purchasing on its own.  Attached number pads mean that I have to put my mouse either too far to my right or too close to myself either way is uncomfortable.  Number pads are invaluable for number inputting and so detached really is the way to go.  - The mouse is also nice although it is my least favorite of the three parts.  It is for right handed people only (which I am) and is a nice middle ground between a conventional and vertical mouse.  It feels a bit cheaper than the rest but works well enough.  I find that the laser tracks better on a variety of surfaces than the average laser mouse but not as well as my logitech darkfield.  There is a version of this keyboard sold without the mouse (look for “for business”) but for the small amount of money you would save just get the mouse it’s worth it.  - Others have said it but it’s worth repeating: the magnetic battery covers are super fun.  The keyboard and mouse have this the number pad doesn’t.  They are snappy clicky and fun.  They are unnecessarily well designed in a delightful way.  - I like the negative tilt option on the keyboard.  This is useful for lower desks.  I wish this was done with the little flip-out-feet that are often used to give the option of a positive tilt on cheap keyboard.  As it is the attachable bar is one more thing to tote around and keep track of.THE BAD:  - The USB receiver is too big!  If you just leave it plugged into a laptop it will snap off.  Logitech has solved this with its unifying receiver which Microsoft has already copied on some of its other products.  Why doesn’t this have that?  For a desktop setup this won’t matter but I’m a laptop person and I find this needlessly under-designed.  They should have saved the design time on the magnetic battery covers and made this a priority.  This is why I knocked off the star that I did.  I have attached a picture to demonstrate this.  - While I’m complaining about the receiver I should also say that it is impossible to know which way to plug it in.  You will see in one of the pictures that I’ve drawn a silver sharpie dot so that I know which way is up.  The logitech receivers come with a red dot so that you know.  - The top row of keys aren’t keys.  They are buttons with more the feel of a phone power button then a key.  This feels like unnecessary cost-cutting.  Also when my keyboard arrive one of this keys was stuck as shown in one of the pictures.  This was easily fixed but still a sign of poor design.  - No one is really thinking of using this for gaming but I’ll go ahead and state the obvious: the split design doesn’t work well for gaming.  I don’t blame the keyboard at all but it is worth noting.  - I love the power switch on my Logitech mouse.  It’s large enough to operate quickly with my thumb without looking and protects the delicate optics in transport.  This ergonomic mouse has a bit of a finicky on/off switch.  Not a huge deal but worth noting.I feel it is important to point out the imperfections but I really do like this keyboard.  It saves a lot of stress on my hands and has made my days more pleasant.  I’m very happy with this purchase.If you found this helpful please click the “Yes” next to “was this review helpful to you?”  Many thanks!
4,I spend a lot of time on my MacBook Pro daily. I love the keyboard on the device but it's not very ergonomically friendly. The only offerings from Apple are the same. The trackpad is also AMAZING on all Apple laptops but it's kind of hard to use all the time in my line of work to me. This keyboard is stupid quick to setup and feels great!I will say the devices take some getting used to if you're not used to ergonomic keyboards. Even just typing the word keyboard I tried to used my left hand to type the letter Y and my right hand to type the letter B which were both across the gap in the middle of the keyboard. The result was Ketnoard. However I'm learning. It's just a bad habit I've probably picked up across the years. The mouse is nice and has a total of 7 buttons. I was really hesitant to order this mouse I mean look at it. Sure enough it feels great to use though.The only thing I was a little disappointed in: It's not bluetooth. That's why I give it 4-stars. Maybe most PC style wireless keyboards and mice are usb and I'm just ignorant but it would be nice if it was bluetooth.Overall: greatFOR MAC USERS: After some experimenting and research I've been able to make this set VERY mac friendly.1. Switching the Alt and Windows keys. By default the Alt key on the keyboard is where the command key usually is and the windows key is where the Alt key usually is on a mac keyboard. This can easily be swapped in System Preferences as long as you can remember you've made the swap and don't rely on looking at the key names.Go to System Preferences ->  Keyboard -> Modifier Keys -> Microsoft® 2.4Ghz Transceiver v9.0 (from the drop down)Change the Option Key to Command in the drop down then change the Command Key to Option in the drop down. Click Ok.2. Using the mouse buttons with the mouse. This is where it gets tricky as Apple doesn't want to play as nice. Look on the internet for a tool called BetterTouchTool. Using this tool you 'rewire' the mouse buttons. You'll have to read how to use this tool since it would be a little much for me to explain here but trust me: if you want to use the mouse buttons download that FREE program.
4,As others have mentioned the durability of the padding a rubber on these isn't terrific. As far as comfort I do really like the keyboard. The throw on the keys is short but comfortable. The mouse is ok I do find it bulky and I prefer an old intellimouse 3 or my logitech  G500.None of the pieces has any lights to indicate num/scroll lock or connectivity which is a little annoying.The absolute worst piece of this set though is the separate keypad. It seems like it was designed by a completely different team. It has no ergonomics. It's just a flat pad. The battery compartment of the keyboard and mouse are both magnetically attached panels and use AA or AAA batteries. The keypad needs a coin not a screwdriver because the groove is too narrow a COIN.  And the panel must then be pried off. And it uses a CR2430 battery. Who the hell has that?
5,Excelente calidar y confort para el uso diario.
5,This desktop is amazing. I was a fan of the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Desktop 7000 (and before that the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 which is the wired version of the keyboard). This blows the old design away. Where the previous keyboard was huge and bulky the biggest keyboard I've ever used this is the smallest full-sized keyboard I've used. That's because they streamlined it and split the number pad from the keyboard. To streamline the keyboard they got rid of some of the bells and whistles you don't need like the home key and programmable silver keys at the top which I thought I liked until I found out how much better it is not having them on the keyboard taking up desk space. Microsoft also combined the media keys with the F keys. The center zoom switch which I thought I liked and the browser back and forward keys which I never used are gone too and good riddance. When I first viewed the picture of the product I thought the empty space between the two sides of the keyboard was Microsoft skimping on the zoom key but it as actually a smaller lighter cleaner design. The zoom key was redundant anyway.  Now I understand why Steve Jobs didn't like Apple's addition of keys to their keyboards when he left the company. This keyboard is just cleaner than the previous design and leaves a smaller footprint. The keys are now electronic and not mechanical which means you don't have to press them as hard. They give your fingers great clicky feedback too. The split space bar is far more comfortable for your thumbs than the space bar on the previous design. The keys are slightly indented to fit your fingers. It is extremely comfortable to type on this keyboard. On the bottom of the keyboard gone are the fragile front lifts which kill the ergonomics anyway and now the ergonomic back lift attaches with magnets instead of plastic catches. The magnets work great and make it easier to attach and remove the lift. The lids for the battery compartments on the keyboard and mouse are also done with magnets which also work excellently. As for the new mouse it is just as comfortable as the old mouse but far more responsive with the newer BlueTrack Technology. I have a shiny wooden desk and had to use a mouse pad with the older ergonomic mouse but not with this one. This mouse tracks perfectly. Unlike the previous version which had two extra programmable keys this has one extra programmable key (the back key) and a non-programmable Windows key (which does the same thing as the one on the keyboard). The number pad is small but the number keys are full size and there is a calculator button to pop up your calculator program. It is so much better that it is not attached to the keyboard. You can put it anywhere or put it away when you are not using it. The only thing I'm slightly disappointed in is the dongle. Though it is much smaller and better than the previous version and though there is a nice compartment for it in your mouse when you are not using your desktop it still sticks out from the USB port when in use and it can break. You shouldn't keep it in your laptop when you are mobile. For years Logitech has been making a dongle so small that it hardly sticks out from your USB port and would be very difficult to break. You can keep it in your laptop and forget about it when you're mobile. I was hoping for something more like that. Just be careful with the dongle especially after your desktop is out of warranty because I don't think they sell the dongle separately.  As for the manufactures warranty Microsoft has an excellent three-year warranty on all keyboards mouses and desktops and their customer service is amazing. Not only does this desktop work great it also looks great on your desk.
1,After buying this keyboard and using it briefly I had to move. During the move I lost the dongle and now the keyboard is useless -- and Microsoft doesn't have any option to replace it. As everyone else said heed the warnings and get another brand that allows you to replace that small receiver in the case it's lost/broken.
4,I've been an ergonomic keyboard guy for a long time.  Since I have to type for a living anything that makes my fingers and life better is a good thing.  I saw this and was immediately taken by the style of the keyboard.  Plus the fact that the keys are soft touch keys.  So I raced out to buy it.Right out of the box setup on Windows 7 could not have been easier.  Take the USB key out of the GIGANTIC mouse insert into computer and presto!The USB key is big.  We've gone back a step with this one.  Logitech's Nano Receivers are tiny.  This is a step back in time to the larger USB receivers.  I.e. You won't leave the USB key in your laptop while traveling or it will snap off.The keyboard has a soft touch which I am really enjoying.  It's taken a little bit of time adjusting to the keyboard from   Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 for Business        .  The biggest difference for me is the fact that the number keys are no longer where I expect them.  The Home Insert & Delete keys are no slightly smaller.  I was used to cruising around with the arrow keys and it's taking me a little time to get adjusted to the new placement.  It's not a huge problem but it's a change if you're coming off of a full-sized Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard.The number keys being off to the side have not really presented me with much of an issue.  I haven't really used the dedicated number key pad as I usually use the number keys on the keyboard itself.The mouse is not my friend.  After a while I found my hand getting tired.  Basically for me it's too large.  I prefer my   Logitech Wireless Anywhere Mouse MX for PC and Mac (910-003040)         which works quite well.  With this mouse I feel like I'm moving a boulder.  Come to think of it my last batch of Microsoft Keyboard/Mice combo's have all ended up with the mouse in a drawer.  I'm not a fan.Overall I'm happy.  My typing speed has started to improve the more and more that I use this and it feels comfortable.  The mouse won't ever get much use and the number pad will sit off to the side for the few times that I need it.  It's pretty and makes a nice statement.  I think it's up to you to determine if it's worth the price.
5,I've been using this keyboard and mouse for several years now.  Once upon a time I was using the older style black ergonomic MS keyboard and loved the functionality.  But the keys were getting sticky after nearly a decade of service.  I love the layout feel of the keys on the Sculpt and I type waaaay faster with this chick-let style keyboard.  The hand position is great and the wrist pad is comfy.  I use the magnetic riser for a very neutral wrist position. I don't use the extra function keys on the keyboard.  You have to flip a function switch and it just isn't as intuitive as a couple of mouse clicks to do the same things.  Besides you can program your mouse to do some of that anyway.  My one beef with the Sculpt keyboard is the lack of indicator lights - there are none at all.  I'm using a little program just to tell me if Capslock or Numlock are enabled!  Seriously a small LED would have been easy to implement.The keypad off to the side is a good and bad thing.  I like that I can move it wherever I want and it minimizes the keyboards footprint but it's not "right there" when I go to use it.  Even after a couple of years with this set up I still have to think about using it.  Both the keypad and the keyboard have a calculator key built in which is very handy.  My biggest beefs with the keypad have to do with the battery enclosure.  On the keyboard and mouse they utilized magnets to keep the lids in place.  But on the keypad it's a weird snap lock thing.  Secondly they use a CR2430 coin battery that you will not find in any "normal" stores and they are expensive if you go to a battery shop.  Order a set from Amazon while you're here! https://www.amazon.com/Energizer-CR2430-Lithium-Button-battery/dp/B00MWA01EQ/ref=sr_1_3?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1516200346&sr=1-3&keywords=cr2430+batteryThe mouse is comfy and replaced a Logitech Marble Mouse.  I still have the Marble Mouse but I was doing a lot of repetitive mouse work for a while and my wrist was getting tweaked.  That went away with the Sculpt mouse .  The thumb cut out really does help to position your wrist in a more neutral position.  It has your standard left/right buttons and a scroll wheel.  The scroll wheel is a third button and it has the ability to click down left and right.  There is a Windows button that brings up the Windows menu and a fifth button in the thumb cutout under the Windows button.  All of these are programmable for nearly every typical task you could imagine.Overall this was a great purchase.  If you like ergonomic keyboards you'll love this one.  If you aren't sure once you get over the funkiness of the arc and split keys you will fall in love.
4,Nicely executed wireless keyboard/mouse set (there are some negatives keep reading).Unpacking was a little bothersome - it's adequately protected but packaged very tightly as you often find with these type of electronics.  I'm one of those that like to carefully preserve original packaging in the event of need for return.  With this package there was an overwhelming desire/need to finally quit trying to fish it out and just start ripping open.Setup was a snap.  Quick start instructions are under the keyboard.  Pretty much installs itself.  User will need to plug the antenna into a USB port on their computer.Batteries included.  Looking ahead (assuming I continue to use this) I was disappointed the one of the 3 components the flat numerical pad uses an uncommon 3 volt battery that will be a slight hassle to match up and replace.Performance and design:  Works great (of course) but I'm an old guy and this product is not one that I would recommend for a keyboard duffer such as I.  I am a 3 or 4 finger typist not formally trained but can hack my way along fairly well.  But the ergonomically designed split keyboard on the Microsoft Sculpt just does not work for me (and I assume other people in my age/skill group).  It really messes up my self-taught routine.  I'll commit to one more month of trying to adapt but at this point am expecting that I'll go back to my old conventional setup.  Other components . . . the mouse feels funky.  I thought the original that came with my computer WAS well-designed and totally comfortable and friendly.  I don't like having to re-learn when there is really no benefit.  The little flat separate wireless numerical pad looks cool and is great in concept (notwithstanding my battery complaint) BUT in my application which is a working desk with a perpetual shuffle of notes papers and reference material -- the numi-pad keeps getting pushed aside and buried.  It would be better off tethered somehow to the keyboard.My summary:  Nice product.  For a young or very competent speed typist with a clean desk this is a suggested product.  For an old resistant-to-change amateur like myself maybe not such a good idea.  Nicely done but it's not for everyone.
3,I've been using the original Microsoft Natural keyboard since the 90s going to eBay once one breaks so I'm no stranger to ergo keyboards.  At home I'm a MacBook guy but at work I need something which won't strain the wrists.  This time though I decided to splurge for Microsoft's current offering for those of us on Windows 7 and decided to try their mouse too since at $20 it was just as good as buying another cheap Logitech.First off some stuff that you probably already know from other reviews:  the keys are chiclet keys and the number pad is separate.  The mouse is huge.  All three have a mix of a disc battery and AA & AAA batteries (all included).  The layout is non-standard when you get to the right side of the keyboard.  Now let's talk about the experience of daily use.The mouse.  This is the most frivolous part of the review since you can buy the same keyboard without the mouse and are probaby considering doing so.  Like every other review here I will advise that you do so.  The mouse is large and if you're sitting at an ergonomically correct angle comfortable--kind of.  It's the sort of mouse that you're supposed to rest your hand on not actively manipulate with just your fingers.  If you have to do this while standing above a desk it will quickly become apparent that you won't like doing so.  Even sitting down though the mouse sits so high that frequently I'll move my hand from the keyboard back to the mouse only to have misjudged the clearance and whacked the mouse off the keyboard tray across the room.  It's a tall mouse and you can do much better just about anywhere else particularly if you're the kind of person who just uses their fingers to move a mouse while keeping your wrist stationary.  All of that said the buttons are nice and firm and the Start key is useless but not in your way.The keyboard.  I really like this keyboard save for a couple of caveats that quickly grew annoying and if I had to use it all day (I only use it about 2 hours a day) would make me get rid of it.  Let's begin with the good:  The keys are nice and the "hump" is perfect.  If you like Mac keyboards you'll like this keyboard.  The magnetically attached front riser is amazing and I love it.  The bad though is bad.-The function row is just garbage and if you use the funciton keys routinely they are absolutely not up for the task.  Let me be clear: this is a dealbreaker if you need function keys.-Next up the separate number pad.  Some people want one and I understand why and if you do then this doesn't apply to you.  However if you're like me and use the number pad while typing well get used to that being terrible.  If you use the riser then the number pad will be at a different angle which isn't great.  It's also never exactly where you left it because it's light and moves easily so you're always looking down for it.  Lastly I've found that I really want to know that the corner of the keyboard is the Enter key especially with the weird right-side layout of the keyboard.  The Enter key isn't really that big and it's easy to lose with that oversized Delete key drawing my attention.  Only the bottom right isn't Enter it's the bottom right of the number pad which may or may not be where I left it.  It's a daily frustration.So that's it.  It's a decent keyboard with some really frustrating compromises.  If and when it breaks I have no doubt I'll replace it with an eBay'd 25 year old Microsoft Natural.
3,I would be a fan of the Ergonomic Desktop if only the wireless connectivity were reliable.  Sadly it simply has not been reliable on my set and I've used it both on my home computer and on my work laptop at the office.  In both places several times a day the connectivity would become very erratic with the mouse updating its position perhaps twice a second and the keyboard regularly missing keys or occasionally inserting duplicates.  This makes it both difficult to click on things and nearly impossible to write anything extended particularly passwords.  After a week and a half of ownership I've come to the conclusion that it's time to return them within the 30-day return period as I can't have a mouse and keyboard that aren't reliable at their core tasks.I've used Logitech wireless mice and keyboards and the   Gigabyte FORCE M9 ICE Performance Wireless Laser Mouse (GM-FORCE M9 ICE)         in both of these environments without issue so I know they aren't overloaded with wireless signals to the point of being impossible to have a wireless mouse/keyboard work reliably.Other than that however I largely liked them particularly the mouse.  The mouse is quite tall but that forces me to keep my wrist off the mousepad/desk which has already had a positive impact for me.  The angle of the hand is also not as horizontal relative to the desk as it is for most mice.  On the downside I wish it were slightly longer (front-to-back) as I have fairly large hands but over the past week I've grown used to its size and it is not too small.  The left/right scrolling on the mouse wheel is also rather nice although for traditional up/down scrolling I haven't found the mouse to be ergonomically unusual in terms of stress on the fingers in either a positive or negative way.The keyboard does have the split layout for more natural hand positioning and fairly little key carry without as much force required to type as on my   Microsoft Wired Keyboard 600 (Black)         or the   Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000         which is my regular keyboard at work.  It also requires less desk space than either particularly the Natural 4000 due to its separate Num Pad.  However I find the palmrest on the Natural 4000 to be more comfortable and I also miss the dedicated media keys of the 4000/Wired 600.  This keyboard instead has them on a toggle switch with the function keys.  As I use both with some frequency particularly F5 and the volume up/down keys this means having to toggle frequently or as I've started doing more reaching for the knob on my speakers.  Not as convenient as having dedicated keys.  The Escape key is also pretty far out on the upper-left and not easy to find by touch as it is on the Natural 4000 and Wired 600.  Lastly the arrow keys and Home/Page Up/Page Down/End are on the far right and thus not really conveniently/ergonomically positioned if you use them often as I do; they've better positioned to regular use on the Natural 4000 and arguably on the Wired 600 as well.I would certainly give the mouse another go if it had a wired version and may take my chances on a second wireless one.  Even if not however it's taught me that I need to make sure I'm not dragging my wrist across the desk all day and I've already started doing that on the taller of my traditional mice when I've switched to them out of frustration with not being able to click on things when the wireless was acting up on the Sculpt.I'm heavily favoring getting a second Natural 4000 instead of another Sculpt Keyboard however.  Other than perhaps less key force/distance and less overall desk space I struggled to find areas where I would choose it over the 4000.Thus in all I'd give 2 stars for the keyboard where the issues are if anything more annoying than the mouse 4 for the mouse (since in spite of its issues it did prove to be ergonomically beneficial) for 3 average.  Were it not for wireless issues or if there were a wired version it would be an easy 5 for the mouse probably 4 for the keyboard and a solid 4+ overall.
4,Microsoft was the first to break out with the ergonomic keyboard that was actually useful and their first mouse commonly referred to as the Dove bar was awesome.  This keyboard combo would be right up there with their best innovations but for a few minor details.1.  There is no way to know if you have the caps key on or off and the same with the num locks key.  Just have to start typing and hope you got it right.2.  The top row of keys are half sized.  This should make it easier to tell that you are on the top row but I find that I end up hitting two keys are once or getting a key on the row below it.3.  The right button on the mouse is entirely too sensitive and is prone to be activated when you least expect it to like when you go to move the mouse.4.  I like the shape of the keyboard and the mouse has a decent feel to it.5.  It is taking some getting used to the separate number keypad but not terribly inconvenient.6.  Finally and this is a problem with nearly all of Microsoft's wireless devices there is no way to turn them off to conserve the batteries.Overall it is what it is and I will use it daily until it dies on me like all keyboards and mice eventually do.
2,I just purchased my third iteration of this keyboard. I broke my first one but the second one started acting up in my home office after three years. I would start typing and nothing would happen. Then after ten seconds it might work again. But then five of the same letter would come out but none of some others I had typed. I stopped using it for a while but the replacement (the Surface ergo) is bluetooth and cannot support more than one connection so I had to manually re-pair every time I switched between devices (several times per weekday). I finally broke down and replaced the keyboard again and it lasted a week before this issue started happening again! I am furious with this device but it's the nicest thing I've typed on and I don't want to have to adjust my writsts/hands to another layout and position. So I'm slowly troubleshooting yet again.
3,In the past 6 years I've purchased the Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic keyboard & mouse set THREE times. It's the best-looking and most comfortable wireless ergonomic set I can find but it does not have longevity (although some of this is admittedly user error - see Cons below).Pros:+ Ergonomic: I get wrist pain typing on laptop keyboards and using normal 'flat' mouse but never had any problems using this keyboard/mouse set for ~6 years. Mouse is gigantic and takes some getting used to but it's fun to see other people struggle with it when they want to show you something on your computer.+ Design: Aesthetically I love this set particularly the keyboard. It is sleek & simple (I only use for basic computing no need for customizing keys etc). I love that the 9 key number pad is detached as well. This makes it so you can use your mouse closer to your keyboard (number pad not in the way)+ Keyboard: The keys are shallow easily pressed and quiet/pleasant-sounding. I miss this. The keyboard I use now (wired Microsoft ergo keyboard) requires more forceful key-pressing and is super loud and people often say I sound like I'm typing very angrily and are you ok??+ Only takes up 1 USB port for keyboard & mouseCons:+ If you lose the USB dongle this set is rendered useless. If you lose the mouse you have to buy a new set or a new mouse taking up an extra USB slot.+ In one of the sets the 9 key number pad stopped working within 6 months+ Shows wear & tear on 'soft' parts of mouse/keyboard within a year+ If you drop the mouse the magnetic closure flies off & batteries are violently expelled (not a horrible problem but certainly annoying and kind of embarrassing if you accidentally drop during a meeting or while walking through a quiet office)I've decided to move to cheaper replacements now (wired Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard and ergonomic Jelly Comb mouse) as I can't justify buying this set for a 4th time. However if you're more careful with your belongings & don't lose/drop things as easily as me this could be perfect for you :)
4,It is a strange animal and I hope I'll get used to it.The key positions do feel strange especially since I've been used with a certain type of layout for so long. As I'm typing this I find it hard to use the "y" and the "h" keys. Since I'm a writer I'm already a fast typist and I don't appreciate that I need to relearn the layout of the keyboard. I do hope it will grow on me though as most people say it will.It also works fine on Mac. With some third party software you can even get the function keys to work properly. It takes some configuring but there's nothing like this on the market for Apple products.Will I keep it? I don't know. It feels nice there's good travel and feedback and the wrist palm is very comfortable. It feels definitely better than my MacBook Air keyboard. Yet it's a bit hard to overcome over a decade of muscle memory on normal keyboards. I guess I'll try and see. So far I'm not impressed about my experience with it but it is definitely a well made product.PS: The mouse though is too strange. I prefer to use a normal shaped one.
4,I do love the shape and feel of the keyboard.  The soft touch keys are a huge plus.  I hate stiff loud clicking keys so this has a very nice feel to it.  However there are a few quirks I'm not fond of. I actually don't like that the number pad is separate. Because it's not attached there is a tendency for it to move into awkward positions and it's always in the way of the natural position for the mouse. If they had just kept the number pad attached it would have gotten 4.5 stars. Another issue I find awkward is that the function keys are a lower profile than the rest of the keys so I find I have to look for them to use them.  They are not simple to just reach for and use.  It's a shame really since the keyboard itself is shaped perfectly and the laptop feel of the keys is very nice. And for some stupid reason Microsoft decided that the delete key needed to be larger than normal and re-positioned so I constantly hit it by mistake. I'm still using it but I am continuously annoyed a the number pad being in the way of the mouse.
4,I write a lot of multi-page reports so keyboard comfort is my first prerequisite. I Initially bought this to use with my Macbook pro as I am a tall guy and laptop keyboards are just way too cramped for me and I prefer to raise my screen when possible. It works quite well with the Macbook and with a few slight key adjustments mimics the Mac's layout and functionality pretty well. The chiclet style keyboard is responsive and took little time to orient myself to. Having had the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard wireless version as my PC keyboard for years I was pleased to find this update a little less of a desktop real estate hog. I have a damaged wrist and the ergonomics of this keyboard work well for me the wrist/palm rest has just enough padding and is just deep enough to accommodate my hand size. I like it so much I am ordering another one for my PC.The mouse is accurate but Microsoft have compromised the ergonomics by having the resting position halfway in between a standard mouse and the great if heavy  Natural series.Pros:Nice keyboard layout and actionLight portable and works well with Macs and PCNot perfect but good ergonomicsAttractive construction* and feels pretty solidCons:Chews through the 2 "AAA" batteries - a set a week so far (should have an off switch like the mouse)No fast forward or rewind AV keys only play/pauseMouse is not as good as the "Natural 6/7000" models (less of a side rest position)*Glossy finish on keyboard is looks cool but is easily marked even with microfibre cloth resulting in hazing and fine scratches. Shows gunk well
2,As I write this my receiver is ls than a foot from my keyboard. None the less I had to switch to a similar wired version of the same keyboard just to type this out. Over the past month the connection fails on me multiple times a day significantly impeding my work. I'm in tech work heavily in writing/communication and data and can't use a keyboard that just stops registering. Such a waste as I really like it overall and haven't had any other issues up until recently. I don't even feel comfortable selling it to anyone due to the issues I'm experiencing will likely end up in the trash. Was my favorite keyboard until this started happening and now there's nothing I can use it for.
4,The keyboard and mouse are a change to get used to for someone who used the standard keyboard or even the curved keyboard.  It has alleviated a lot of my issues with my tendinitis though.The only issue I have is that the function keys stick and as a programmer I use them a lot and it can get annoying.  It really only sticks if you hit it too hard but as one of those "loud" typers I tend to do this.I would still recommend the product if you have issues with your wrist or fingers it is helpful and works good.  Just make sure that you learn home row because I can never hit the B key as it was always on the wrong side.  It's not. I am just bad at Home Row. :)Update 8/18 -My battery needed changing on my keyboard and/or mouse.  The indicator light is hard to see and the only thing that told me is part of my mouse stopped working I was unable to click anything.  I changed the mouse batteries and still had issues with my mouse.  I restarted my computer took it off the docking station and it was still not working.  I took the batteries out of the keyboard and now it looked to be working fine.  I now changed the keyboard batteries and everything started working.  The mouse must connect through the keyboard primarily unless it is turned off.  This was annoying and the indicator light was not showing that it was dying.  It disrupted my work as I tried figuring out what was wrong in the meantime.I hope they better improve the indicator that it is out or not by turning it red or flashing.  I normally do not see the light and found it frustrating that I could not figure out what was wrong with my mouse easily.
4,Third MS natural keyboard I've used the one at work I've had for over 8 years and take with me when I switch companies.This one they clearly tried to ramp up the aesthetics.  It's all piano black and the base keyboard I feel is very elegant and excels in form as much as function.  I know other's have indicated that some functions are difficult but I've found most ergonomic keyboards take a little bit of getting use to because everyone is use to the straight layouts and there is no single best ergonomic style.  After getting use to it for 20 mins I find it very easy to type and I very much like the feel of the keys.  They stand is very interesting as well it's not the typical propped up leg it's kind of a wave that sits in the base and easily detached.The 9 key-keypad I don't like it for 2 reasons.  Since it's separated it requires an additional battery (making it 3 for the set if you couldn't deduce that it's not powered wirelessly ;)) and since it's smaller it does move once in a while.  Most don't use it so I'm assuming the intent is you can't chuck it if you aren't an accountant.The mouse well it's stupid.  As much as I like the actual keyboard the mouse is ridiculous.  It's a big honking ball and feels like I'm using one of those old magic 8 balls.  The kind with the mystery blue water in it that solves the world's most pressing issues by asking it yes/no questions.  The back button is very awkward to use and after trying for 5 mins I still can't use it comfortably.Its seems like whoever designed the keyboard left the project before the mouse was designed.  Oh yeah and on top of it being awkward ugly and difficult to use it's weighs about as much as an iPhone which for a plastic mouse is rather heavy and cumbersome.
4,I've been using this for a couple of years.The ergonomics are good. It solved the wrist/nerve issues I was having. I really like the detached keypad and how small the keyboard is with out it. I just pull the keypad over when I use it (which for me is not too often) and position it for comfort. The mouse is ok no real issues.The soft padded area on the keyboard will start to discolor rapidly. It is functional but the cosmetics go fast. The letters have worn off of several of the keys.There don't see to be alot of split keyboards out there. It is possible I will buy another one to replace it when it fails. I don't see anything similar out there. It is good and functional but could be a bit better. I don;t think I have replaced the batteries in the keypad or keyboard yet. they last a long time. I use this at work so many hours a day on it. The mouse batteries seem to last about a year for me. I may opt for a different mouse when the time comes.
4,The good:Very stylish sexy design.Chiclet keys for near-silent typing.Split ergonomic keyboard layout - very good if you're used to it; if not IMO it's worth getting used to if you're not too set in your ways.Separate number pad.Wireless USB dongle just works. No fuss no "connect" buttons to press just make sure to download the latest driver for it first.Mouse is well designed and ergonomic - slightly more vertical hold than normal ones though not quite as pleasant for my big hand as my   Evoluent VerticalMouse 4 "Regular Size" Right Hand (model # VM4R) - USB Wired        .Cool magnetic battery latches on the keyboard and mouse and on the keyboard raiser.The mediocre:Arrows/home/end/pgup/pgdwn layout differs from all previous MS ergonomic keyboards and will take getting used to (unless you're in the habit of turning off num-lock and using the number pad for these.)Mouse USB refresh rate is only the standard 125 Hertz - which is actually not bad for a wireless mouse but nowhere near today's gaming mice which can all do 500-1000 Hz.The bad:The escape key is delegated to being a half-sized barely-moving shallow button rather than an actual key as are the F1-F12 function keys.Alternate function keys (the usual 'multimedia' shortcut buttons for volume play/pause etc.) only function after sliding a switch which completely disables the function keys. Which means if you have any use for the F1-F12 function keys whatsoever you'll never ever get to use the alternate functions.All in all it's got the sexy look and enough advantages (near silent typing!) that I recently changed out my   Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000         for this - but mouse wise I'll never be able to go back to anything less than the buttery smooth 1000 Hz of my gaming mouse.Note that the keyboard and mouse are available separately (or will be very soon after this review was written) for less than the entire kit.
4,I purchased the Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop about 10 days ago.  I like it.  However I have found a problem with the software compatibility with this keyboard.  In Microsoft Word if you want to change the formatting of the Table of Contents in a document  you press ALT-F9 to switch from the TOC to the underlying codes which govern formatting.  With these codes on the screen you can do things like suppress the page numbers in one level of your TOC.  It's a function that doesn't come up very much but when it does  you need it to work.The Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard will not trigger the change between text and codes.  Microsoft appears to be using a non-standard set of key codes for at least this function key.  When I unplug the Sculpt and plug my old keyboard in it works.  When I switch back it doesn't.A minor flaw but there may be other incompatibilities that I haven't found yet.  I would think this is something that can easily be fixed with an update to the driver.  I just tried to do that at Microsoft but my computer informed me that I have the latest driver.UPDATE:  After adapting to the problem discussed above I discovered that none of the function keys act as I expect them to.  This seemed unbelievable so I looked around the keyboard and found a small switch in the upper right corner labeled "Fn" that has two positions - blue and gray.  Switching it to the gray setting makes the function keys do what they are supposed to.I think the Sculpt Ergonomic desk set is excellent but would prefer better documentation.  The sheet that comes with it is pictorial and obviously I didn't understand what the switch was for.
4,I am a heavy keyboard user. In the past 8 years I broke 3 Microsoft Ergonomic 4000 keyboards. To compare this keyboard with 4000 a few things:1. detached Numpad is the No.1 reason I switch to this keyboard. Those who don't see the point of having numpad detached you can stop reading. It saves a lot of arm movement for guys like me who need to constantly switch between keyboard and mouse.2. key travel distance is much shorter than 4000. It takes time to get used to. But in the end it works out pretty well. Now when I type on 4000 my fingers get tired pretty quickly.3. keyboard layout is tighter. It also takes time to get used to.After 10 months I noticed my first Sculpt keyboard started missing key strokes. New battery didn't help. After a few minutes of talking to Microsoft custom service they gave me a new replacement. I needed to send the broken keyboard back at my expense. Shortly after I got the new one I found it still missed key strokes. Then I realize it might be a signal or interference issue. I moved the USB receiver from under the table to the monitor. It seems to fix the problem. But I don't know why the signal was OK for the first 10 months. At the same time my Logitech M570 trackball has no signal problem whatsoever with the USB receiver under the table.
4,I really love this keyboard ... ergonomically speaking. It took a little getting used to but the relief on my wrists and general posture is incredible. I say this as an ex dental hygienist and chronic sufferer of carpal tunnel and pinched nerves in both shoulders who is now a photographer and graphic designer who spends 75% of my waking hours in front of the computer.That said I have had this keyboard for about a year and I can tell you that it eats batteries like crazy. I was using re-chargables for a while and maybe that was my first mistake. Sometimes I would change the batteries eve 2nd or 3rd day. So I switched to traditional batteries and the only last about a week before half of my keystrokes stop registering.I'm hoping they will come up with some sort of rechargeable solution like my Logitech mouse which I occasionally plug in to the computer w/ USB to recharge. I will definitely patiently wait for Microsoft to (yet again) come up to speed with better technologies. Because hands down (pun intended) this is the best ergonomic keyboard.
4,I'm on a computer all day long and a good Keyboard and mouse matter to me.  I'll start with summing up the review rather than having you wait all the way to the end.  In short the keyboard is great.  The mouse is ok; it's a bit small and needs a back AND forward button.Keyboard:The keyboard is a great.  They keys have a nice bounce to to them and the key travel is short (i.e. the keys respond quickly you don't have to push down too far.)  The keypresses are quiet; a lot quieter than the ergonomic keyboard 4000 I had prior to the sculpt.  Keep in mind that the number pad is separate from the alpha keys.  I actually like this because I have an ergonomic drawer that my keyboard sits on.  Having extra room is nice - escpecially since i'm not punching in numbers all day long.I was a bit worried about the keyboard feeling flimsy because of the "hole" in the middle but it actually feels pretty solid.Pleasant surprise: the battery door on the keyboard AND mouse are both magnetic.  They're very easy to open and close; I really like that.The MouseI'm not sold on the mouse.  I'd like a forward AND back button for one.  Also the mouse feels a bit too small.  It  tracks well and I had no issues getting it connected but it just doesn't feel as good as a nice full sized logitech mouse.
3,I have been using this keyboard / number-pad / mouse combo for several hours today so far and these are my initial thoughts.They keyboard: First If you love mechanical keyboards then this is not for you. With that being said here is the good:Good: The keys definitely have a more satisfying click then any of the standard keyboards i have been using lately such as the basic dell. The keys have a slightly longer stroke and are slightly stiffer then the apple keyboard (which to me is the closet key feeling I have used to this) but i like it as I find I am having fewer accidental key presses or double entries. As only an ok touch typist (I cheat half the time) I am definitely finding this keyboard is challenging my skills but in a good way and feel I will be a better more accurate typer for it. None of the specialty keys seem to work on my windows 7 machine but that might have to do with my companies install of windows and not the keyboard all of the function keys work in that mode and I don't mind the toggle switch to change function instead of a FN buttonBad: Changing the layout of the PgUp/home buttons is a big no no for a power user that has their key commands memorized I have no idea why they did this and arrows being awkwardly cramped at the edge are less the ideal for navigating a spread sheet. Though the biggest issue I have is the lack of a caps lock / insert/ numberlock lights. This is big and I cant understand they don't have them. Other wireless keyboards do see apple. There is also no back lighting of they keys which isn't an issue for me but will be to some and at this price point you expect it.Keypad:This just isn't ergonomic at all. I was better off with the POS keyboards number pad that came with the computer as it at least had some rake to it. as a big excel user this is a huge let down and if I keep they keyboard I will probably be looking for a replacement. with that being said the inclusion of a delete button on it and a hot button for the calc app is convenientMouse:one word... Garbage.  Its awkward at best.  There is just enough sculpting of it to leave you wanting more.  your hand just doesnt feel at home on this thing and I find myself constantly looking for new ways to rest my hand and fingers on it.Final thoughts:This isn't a gaming keyboard why do I need a special higher speed dongle?  The lack of Bluetooth is a big omission here and a waste of a USB port which for some are a precious commodity.  The use of three different battery types (one for each of the devices) is a huge head ache in the near future and just bad planning on Microsoft's part (read stupid).  The lack of a caps lock inidicator is really pissing me off  the keypad could only be less ergonomic if it had spikes on it and I have stopped using the mouse.  With all of that being said for 70 bucks I really like the feel of keyboard and that it might help to relieve some of the strain on my wrists I feel by the end of a long day and I think I am going to keep it.  If you can find it cheaper with out the mouse (I would only find it 5 dollars cheaper) go with that option.
4,Very comfortable keyboard bought this specifically because the keypad was detached which allows for less movement of my bad arm/shoulder between keyboard and mouse. Keys are quiet and easy to press. However 5 months later the wireless receiver broke which rendered keyboard number pad and mouse useless. The receiver can't be replaced you have to replace the whole set. Called Microsoft directly they said the warranty didn't cover the receiver (even though the box clearly states that all hardware is covered for 3 years) but that they would give me a one-time exemption and they would replace the unit after I mailed the broken one back at my own expense with original proof of purchase. I mailed it back and received the replacement in about a week. Lesson learned - do not touch the wireless receiver and if you need to move the laptop at all then remove the receiver gently before you move the laptop. Great keyboard outside of this incident.
5,I have used ergonomic keyboards for years. They are usually loud and very bulky. I went back to school and last semester was a nightmare trying to use the keyboard on my laptop so I decided to get a new keyboard that would be more comfortable therefore making paper writing more efficient. The keys are easy to press although I can be heavy handed when it comes to typing. I love the neutral tilt it has my hands lay very comfortably. I do have severe carpal tunnel in both wrists. I have already had surgery on my right and will have surgery done on the left this year so for me to feel no pain as I sit and type for long periods of time really says something. If you are hesitant because of the price it is worth it. Buy it and try it and if you don't love it return it. You will love it though.Some people mention the mouse and say it is bulky I can see where they are coming from if they don't have an ergonomic mouse pad or something to elevate their hand. For me I think it is comfortable and it responds well.I would definitely recommend this keyboard to anyone who deals with carpal tunnel and still has to spend a lot of time on the computer.
3,If you don't mind a keyboard that shows your dead skin cells where your wrists rest and a few missing keystrokes nowand then again then this keyboard may still not be for you.Sadly the material Microsoft approved for use in this keyboard is terrible for use where your skin may touch where dust may settle or simply get rubbed wrong.  Keep a wet cloth handy to remove blemishes andmarks that seem to get all over the wrist rest magically during the day.Missing keystrokesare common especially space bar which is used often but the occasional misspellings are par for many anyway so this may not be a big issue to those that don't care.  I'm thinking this issue is due to the wireless dongle you have to install.  Wired for a keyboard works best and because Sculpt is wireless keep spare batteries handy for the keyboardmouse and keypad.Functionbuttons require flipping a switch to access.  The odd key layout takes some getting use to if you've ever had a regular Microsoft keyboard before.  Frankly theMicrosoft Natural Ergonomic 4000 is better suited to someone who uses a keyboard on a daily basis especially work related needs. The Sculpt is more for show and it is pretty when you don't use it.The gi-normous mouse may be apt to getting knocked off the desk if you aren't prepared for the almost double-sized height of the Sculpt Mouse. Buttons are easily pressed so hold your hand up high toavoid accidental clicks and drags.Sculpt mouse is also not very accurate so if you use the mouse a lot todraw or select words it's not like the old Microsoft laser mouse.  In my case neither the keyboard nor mouse were properly detectedso I had to manually update Windows. Sadly the default setting for the mouse after update was to scroll more than one page so I had to manually set the mouse back to the setting I've used for years.  For whatever reason Microsoft wantedme to do other than what I wanted with the scroll wheel.The magnetic base is interesting but not really much value. I would say you either useit or don't so why make it easily removable since whenyou pickup the keyboard to clean the base falls off.The only thing I really like about this keyboard is the portable 10-key pad but even then it sits lower than the keyboard so tends to creep under the keyboard during thecourse of a week.I plan to switch back to my old 4000 keyboard soon along with the 8000 laser mouse.  I've spent the last two months giving Microsoft a chance to proveSculpt is better - it is NOT.
3,I'm a huge fan of Microsoft keyboards. Never been much of a fan of their office productivity software but when it comes to keyboards Microsoft fits my needs to a T. I'm using the Microsoft Digital Media Pro keyboard which (I believe) was discontinued years ago. A shame since it has so many useful features.But out with the old and in with the new. I tried and did not care for the previous generation of ergonomic split keyboards from Microsoft. At first glance the Sculpt looked to be a better design. The divide between the two sets of keys did not appear to be as pronounced and my hands seemed to fit the keyboard very well. Love the feel of the pad on the wrist rest area!Installation was straightforward although getting the items out of the box was a challenge. I was happy to see that the necessary batteries were included - nothing worse than having to go hunt for batteries before you can start to use a new device.The keyboard feel strongly reminded me of a laptop. For some that may be a good feature. For me it is not. The flat keys and shorter throw makes typing feel "unnatural." I know that sounds vague but it's the best way I can describe it.This odd feel translated itself into a much slower typing speed - cut my throughput by about half. Since I write reports for a living that's a rather big issue.I also could not come to grips with the function key placement size and meager supply of ancillary keys. That's a feature I love with my current Media Pro keyboard in that I can map pretty much any of the ample number of multimedia keys to any function I choose or even a URL. For example to start SPSS Excel and WP I press one key. Another single keypress also opens my browser and my Amazon cart URL (and yes the lettering on that particular key is pretty much worn completely off from use).Still if I was forced to I could live with the keyboard. I could not under any circumstances live with the mouse in this set. Feels poor lacks refinement and far less versatile than my Logitech M500. I tried my best to get used to the Sculpt mouse but just grew to hate it the longer I used it.Now my opinions are certainly affected by my current choices in keyboards and mice since I've been using them for years and years. I've changed PCs at least three times but have retained the same keyboard and mouse since they have worked so well. If you have less keyboard/mouse "muscle memory" perhaps the Sculpt will fit the bill. The build quality seems decent and if they are as reliable as other Microsoft keyboards it will continue to work for some time. But for me I just can't move the approval meter past "meh" for the keyboard and "dud" for the mouse. Three stars.
4,I bought this keyboard because I need something that wouldn't wear thin on my fingers and wrist. I came from a mechanical keyboard which is wonderful but during long typing sessions my hands felt weird. I didn't like the feeling much.Getting used to an ergonomic keyboard has been a re-learning process but I think the time invested is worth it -- no finger pain no wrist pain even during thousands upon thousands of word typing sessions.A big plus for me is that this set up is wireless. I am weary of dealing with wires.The mouse is surprising accurate and comfortable. The blue center button caters to windows 8 by bringing up the start metro menu --  if you're into that.I don't much fancy the peripheral num pad I hardly use it. But that brings me to my next point: when you push the keys in the num pad the whole thing jiggles as if not on an even surface (it is).The same thing with the keyboard. But if you distribute the weight of your wrists just right you can get away from the jiggling.
4,This is a very nicely built keyboard (physically). I like that the number pad is floating and allows me to have a comfortable right hand mouse grip. For attached numberpads my right arm has to extend out a lot more and is not convenient.The reason why I took out one star is the life of the keyboard. It works great at the start. However after about 8-10 months of use it starts to malfunction. Here are the problems I'm facing:1. Keyboard doesn't work unless batteries are very solid in their voltage. If it drops from 1.5v to 1.35v it stops working. The mouse is much better.2. Shift + v does not work. I have to use CAPS lock to get a capital v.3. 'e' has become much more sensitive and types itself twice even with a mild press.I have never seen such problems in any keyboard before. This seems to be a trend with microsoft products. They are not really good at making solid durable hardware. In the past I have seen even a simple wireless mouse malfunction after about 6 to 8 months of use.I love the concept and the construction. Wish a more reliable company made such a keyboard. If anyone knows of similar construction by a "good HW company" please let me know.
4,This replaced a Natural 4000 and Logitech TrackMan Marble FX Trackball which was my primary setup for over a decade. I've been using this for over a month now and here are a few of the initial takeaways:Pros:-Comfortable & ergonomic layout-New chiclet keys with scissor switches (reminds me of the new ThinkPad)-Efficient design connects via one USB dongle and is great for setups with limited Office Space-Separate Numpad (finally an ergo keyboard with a separate numpad other than the overpriced "goldtouch")Cons:-No bluetooth-No backlight (or any lights for that matter other than initial startup & sync w/ dongle)-Media controls are placed as alternate FN keys and "toggled" by a switch-Might develop love/hate relationship with mouseOverall:-Excellent design and enough improvements upon its legendary predecessor make this fantastic keyboard a worthy upgrade for existing Natural 4000 users or for people in the market for a new ergo setup.-Mouse takes some getting used to and may not be for everyone.Conclusion:-Smooth transition from Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000-Steep learning curve for those not coming from split keyboard design-Competitive pricing for a desktop combo-Mouse could be a potential deal breaker/makerCool feature: magnetic battery covers for mouse (holds usb dongle) keyboard and wristpad although numpad uses screwNot so cool feature: each of the three units use different size batteries (AA for mouse AAA for keyboard CR2430 3V for numpad)
3,I had the desktop set and loved it for the ergonomic design.  I bought three of them over 18 months because it was such a help with my 'mouse shoulder' since it has no built in number pad.Now they will NOT stay functioning.  If you quit using the mouse to read or think for 30 seconds it's likely to lose its connection.  If you remove and reinsert the dongle it might work again on the first try...  or the tenth... or not.I don't know if a Windows upgrade caused the issue or not.  It is a MS product so you'd hope MS Windows would be backward compatible with it but don't assume that for a large corporation.It is tremendously difficult to actually get MS help for this problem.  I've tried all of the applicable internet suggestions.  And I work on a computer all day every work day and have an IT helpdesk at my disposal.  Still no resolution.And as others have mentioned if the dongle gets damaged or lost your set is landfill material.If you have significant ergonomic issues it might be worth the environmental and financial risk.  If you don't I would recommend opting for something less fussy.
3,I love this keyboard - the flat keys allow you to type quickly and its hard to find ergonomic keyboards with flat keys.  The mouse is also very comfortable and responsive.However this keyboard has a couple horrendous flaws that force me to lower the score.  First the dongle on this keyboard is completely ridiculous.  It is very long and very cheaply built which is a terrible combination that causes breaks easily.  If you have a setup where you have to keep removing the dongle or pulling a laptop in and out of a carrying bag it will break for sure.  I am on my third keyboard because of build quality issues which is a testament to how much I like it but also horribly aggravating.Also the keys are very hard to pry up and reattach if something gets stuck below them.  The mechanism underneath breaks very easily and then the keyboard is lost.What's weird is that the keyboard and mouse overall have a pretty sturdy feel to them and are very comfortable and sit nicely on a desk.  I like that the keypad is optional since I never use it which makes the keyboard take up less space.  Not sure why the dongle is garbage.The batteries in the mouse also seem to die somewhat frequently but this is a minor issue.So basically if you're using this set at a fairly stationary desk setup it's the best around.  If you need to go mobile a lot with it and it needs to take some wear do not buy this.
1,I am reviewing after 2 years of use with 2 different sets of this same keyboard + mouse + numberpad combo (that's right - I bought this thing TWICE). My first and second set aged poorly (see pictures from other reviews) and I am a meticulously clean person and both of my sets of this have aged the exact same way. My first set broke as the USB connector snapped when I walked past a wall holding the keyboard. The USB sticks out that far. It's quite large compared to others in the market (see: Logitech). This makes it really easy to accidentally snap it into pieces. Then my second set of this keyboard combo had the mouse break. I'm sad because I have learned to love this mouse shape and split keyboard but alas I cannot afford to shell out a 3rd $100 for this set. Ergonomically I have found it quite comfortable.TLDR: USB is massive and you will snap it into pieces the set ages poorly and looks like you ran it through  a dishwasher by the end and the mouse breaks easily. The clicky part. The best part.
1,I really wanted to love this keyboard. In fact I have purchased three of them over the past 18 months. If it weren't for the fact that two of them simply stopped working altogether with the steady red LED problem along with complete lack of function I would probably have given this deice a 5 star review and that is all of the variants that exist of this keyboard. When it works it is a wonderful device. The problem is there are clearly some major quality issues.First off what is it about this keyboard that is so fantastic that makes it so popular if it has so many problems? Answer it feels wonderful and when it works it's a dream. It is the right shape and size even for practically all typically sized hands. Maybe even for some of the more tiny-handed men out there. Microsoft has perfected the bezel curve of the ergonomic keyboard in the Sculpt and the amount of travel it gives each key is perfect. The feedback of the keys (as in the feel) is perfect as well. The apparently physical quality of the device seems well made (if though it clearly has some design flaws). Even the amount of "clack" that the keyboard makes is satisfying without being obnoxious.So what's the problem? Aside form the things people have talked about ad nauseam (broken keys losing that tiny transceiver means the keyboard is useless etc.. being the seemingly biggest issues) so along with practically all of Microsoft's consumer-grade products support is nowhere to be found. While MS offers comprehensive support plans for their corporate products you are on your own with accessories even if they are expensive bluetooth accessories.  They don't even host proper forums for their accessories (there is no category for this on their official forum) and any information elsewhere on the internet about the Sculpt is strangely scant so trying to find out what the steady red LED means is definitely a no-go. Anything I find is either for another model or simply doesn't map to this condition. Therefore I can't even find out what the red LED light even means let alone attempt to resolve the problem. Their phone and chat support offers no meaningful help as they are unfamiliar with the device. Since I have a Mac they balk and say the device isn't supported on a Mac even though I have been using it for 9 months beforehand without incident. Also the red LED turns on immediately after the new batteries go in so it's probably nothing to do with signal and a failure of the device itself. This seems further evident since the bottom of the keyboard that is underneath the light actually gets warm to the touch so I should assume the keyboard is fried. This would be the second Sculpt keyboard that this has happened to in less than a year so this is not an outlier. I don't do anything to my keyboards that would kill them like this. My old Logitech Wave that I keep having to go back to keeps on ticking.Also note that apparently USB 3 interferes with the wireless signal between the USB dongle and the keyboard a problem I have personally experienced when my keyboard strangely stopped receiving input temporarily for a few seconds and then resume. I thought I solved the problem by using an old USB 2 hub to get the dongle physically closer to the keyboard as I thought it was a reception issue that is so common with Bluetooth devices. (I am not even sure if this even uses Bluetooth and it might just be some proprietary RF signal.) But in fact I later learned that it was the use of a USB 2 port that was far away from my USB 3 ports!Sadly as tantalizing as this device may be I would steer clear of it. It's nothing but trouble.
4,After using the keyboard for almost an year I am pretty happy with it. The keys have a good feedback and typing is effortless. It works well on linux too.Things I don't like:1. The function keys have a different size than the rest of the keys and are difficult to use why touch typing.2. The dongle requires a line of sight with the keyboard most of the times otherwise it leads to missed keys.3. I also wish the arrow keys were in traditional format and not mixed in with other keys.
4,This keyboard with separate numbers pad is great most of my ergonomic clients.  The biggest problem is that after a while weeks months some of the keys start to not function properly.  After throwing out several because Microsoft would not stand behind the product I found a review that figured out what the problem was and offered a solution.  It seems the function keys get stuck periodically and cause other keys to misbehave. Now when this happens we tap all the function keys to make sure they are no longer sticking and we have been able to save the keyboards.  If you are using a document holder in front of the keyboard this can be one of the reasons the function keys get stuck.  It does take a bit of time to get used to the location of some of the keys but this is a very comfortable keyboard set up.
5,Didn't get it off Amazon but I had to write a review. This thing is great!1) It has a separate number pad so you can have the mouse closer to the center for reduced arm strain.2) Ergonomic feature is good but there are others that have similar characteristics (although none look as good)3) This was the ultimate reason I got this: Although sitting down it is decent it really really shines when using it on a standing/treadmill desk! I was able to comfortably place my hands on the keyboard when standing or walking (my SO says that he could easily use it sitting down as well!)4) Although the mouse tends to have mixed reviews it too shines when standing up/walking! This was the only mouse that didn't place my hand in an uncomfortable position when standing/walking! We discovered this when we had gone to the Microsoft store to try them out before buying it since I wanted to make sure. I had initially sat down at the bench and played around with it. We had left the store since we weren't convinced due to the mouse. However my SO remembered we didn't try it standing up. So we walked back tried it out and it was perfect!If you are considering a standing/treadmill desk I highly recommend this (my husband highly recommends it for sitting down as well!). However it really does pay off to go to the store and check it out in person to make sure it is a good fit!Microsoft should definitely try and advertise it for standing desks as well since it is the best one!UPDATEI bought the combo used Late 2014. It failed 2 months ago (very spotty mouse tracking and unresponsive keyboard). This was roughly ~1.5years of continuous use (through grad school so a LOT of writing). This is just a testimonial to the quality of this product! No device will last forever and a USED item lasted 1.5 years for me through intensive use. It will last much longer for you!--Update 9/19/2016--I tried different ergonomic keyboards and mice and none have held their weight against this one. Thus I just ordered another one of these through Amazon this time around! Super excited!
4,This ergonomic keyboard takes awhile to get used to. I have wrist pain problems from working on a computer all day. This setup (the keyboard and mouse) definitely help with that. I got used to the mouse quicker than the keyboard.The mouse is very comfortable after a little while. It really helps with pain in my right wrist that I sometimes get with a regular mouse (I also use a wrist rest for my mouse wrist). It has some useful features as well with the buttons for the start menu and going back. The mouse is 5 stars.The keyboard is comfortable as well but I'm having trouble getting back up to my usual typing speed. I'm sure I will after some more use it just takes some time and feels very awkward and first. The wrist wrest is comfortable though. I had no trouble installing the keyboard or mouse it was very easy. The drivers installed right away and I haven't had any issues with wireless connectivity or battery life in either.The desktop looks very stylish; the black with blue details is nice. It looks sleek and modern. The current price isn't actually that expensive in my opinion for the quality of the products and compared to other desktops.I would definitely recommend it if you are on a computer a lot!
3,I still have the original Microsoft Natural Keyboard Pro from somewhere back in the 90's and to this day it still works.  I forget the actual year it was made but it was back they were making keyboards in Mexico instead of China.  Since they've gone to China I've had bad experiences with their keyboards.  I had a "Wireless Laser Desktop 6000" keyboard that simply didn't work and even with the receiver pointed straight at me it would skip keys I typed.  Apparently the "laser" didn't have enough pew-pew.  I then tried to get a wired Microsoft Natural 4000 and the space bar kept sticking so I gave up on Microsoft and went to Logitech instead.Still I missed that awesome split-keyboard shape and I'm glad Microsoft has once again brought it back.  The keyboard is light with keys that are not as tall as your standard keyboard.  My best guess is halfway between the size of standard keyboards and laptop keyboards.  It types great not as good as mechanical keyboards but as nice as you will get out of membrane keyboards.  You will have an adjustment period if you are used to typing on standard keyboards but your wrists will soon thank you when you are able to separate them instead of squishing them next to one another for typing.The keyboard is not as wide as regular keyboards because they've made the interesting decision to separate the 10-key.  That works out nicely since most deskmakers are stuck in the last century with keyboard trays that barely fit modern-day keyboards much less a mouse pad.  With this you can manipulate both the keyboard and the mouse from the the keyboard tray and lower your arms to a more reasonable level (and avoid the shoulder pain).  In order to accomplish this Microsoft needed to make some changes to the DEL-INS-HOME-END-PGUP-PGDN keys.  The ever popular delete key is given a large key the size of your backspace and rests directly next to the backspace while the rest of the keys line up vertically next to it.  Gamers need not worry as the popular arrow keys are still in the 1 above/3 below configuration instead of the awful plus sign Microsoft was using for a while.  Finally there is a small "function" switch on the top-right of the keyboard that allows you to quickly switch your F-keys into popular commands like media and sound volume adjustments a search button and others.  Unfortunately I cannot access them due to problems I will explain later.As for the mouse this is a wonderful example of form over function.  A big round ball shaped mouse that fits horribly in the hand and is uncomfortable to use.  The palm of your hand falls off the end and you'll find yourself mousing inaccurately with your palm instead of your hand.  Oh and for buttons?  The only button you have is the most useless of all buttons the windows "interrupt anything you're currently doing" key and they won't let you reprogram it.  Just looking at it makes me mad.  This things is so useless that I was not going to recommend this product at all but I found that I can shut the mouse off and use the keyboard side by side with a competing mouse.  So far I have run into no issues or conflicts.And now the drivers how do I hate thee?  All I can say is your experience might vary but I absolutely cannot install these drivers without being greeted with a "software has crashed" error message upon every reboot.  Sometimes I can actually get the software working even while it gives me crash errors.  So I can't evaluate the drivers at all because I absolutely cannot get them to work even though I've taken pains to remove all previous keyboard and mouse software from my computer before installing these.  Fortunately I can get the keyboard to work using "standard" keyboard drivers but don't expect any features assuming there were any in the first place.  Nice job Microsoft.The keyboard uses 2-AAA batteries the mouse uses 2-AA batteries and the 10-key uses a CR2430 watch battery.  The battery covers are easily removed thanks to a slightly magnetic cover that easily pops off.  A nice improvement over standard battery covers.  For some reason they didn't do this to the 10-key. You'll need a flathead screwdriver to remove the cover on it.  In the month I've used the keyboard I haven't had to replace the batteries.  Unfortunately there is no indicator telling me when they will soon need to be changed.To summarize nice keyboard. Horrible everything else. Decide for yourself whether the price is worth it.  Personally I'd skip the desktop and get just the   Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard for Business (5KV-00001)         instead.  Meanwhile I'll wait for the day when Microsoft releases a mechanical keyboard in this split-keyboard shape along with some drivers that work.
4,Ordered this keyboard for work. I have had it for about 2 weeks now.  I love it for the most part types smooth quite ergonomic. I have noticed a huge difference in how my wrists and elbows feel after a days work.  I would prefer that the 10key portion be attached. For this model it is separate and does not have the option to tilt like the keyboard. I couldn't find one that was attached. For someone who uses the whole keyboard and 10key all day long this would be beneficial.
4,Soft touch!!! This is the only keyboard designed for desktops computers that feels like a laptop only better because it is ergonomic. It is fast and responsive. The travel distance from touch to contact is about 1/8 inch. By comparison every other keyboard feels like a manual typewriter. I have arthritis and yet I type 140 works per minute so I need a keyboard that doesn't beat my hands up. I also like the ergonomic pattern. It took a little getting-used-to but it is excellent. This keyboard is the BEST! Had the they provided a way to attach the freestanding number pad I would have given it five stars. Since it moves around I had to tape it to my desk to develop the kinesthetic awareness needed to find the numbers without looking down for the pad.This is an excellent keyboard for anyone who uses a computer for volume production - authors legal secretaries bookkeepers and accountants.
3,I was excited to try this set: I am on my computer a lot and have issues with my wrists at times as well as my right hand in general (I broke my thumb a few years ago and it still flares up). So I was eager to see if I could get some relief.The short answer: yes and no. On the ergonomic front I LOVE the keyboard. I find it extremely comfortable and the split design is extremely comfortable. The keys themselves are extremely short-throw - much like some laptop keyboards I've used and the combination of that the slight raise in the middle and the wrist pad make this thing incredibly comfortable for long stints at the keyboard.On the downside I do NOT like the switchable function keys - I want to be able to use for example F5 without having to flick a switch that disables the media controls. And on THAT topic not only are there no skip forward/skip back keys there's no way to bind those functions to keys that I don't use like volume up and down (I have a separate audio interface with volume control). So that stuff is a drag. Thankfully there's a dedicated calculator key (tow actually one on the keyboard and one on the number pad) but no shutdown or sleep keys and again no way to program a macro for those functions.Still though despite missing those functions I find the comfort alone is enough to carry the day for me. The keyboard isn't perfect but it feels so good I'm still using it.The separated number pad is a wash: I like the compact size on the main keyboard but I don't like reaching for the number pad when I need it and keeping it parked next to the keyboard can leave it in the way of the mouse. It looks cool though so that's (a small) something.For me it's the mouse that's the big letdown here. I was happy to give it a shot despite it looking HUGE but it never got comfortable for me. Part of that is because the the design rotates your hand a bit outward - nice in theory since your hand naturally does that but in use it places the weight of my hand and arm directly and exclusively on a the large carpal at the bottom-outside edge of my palm right above the wrist crease. I found the pressure irritating after a short time and retired the mouse after a week or two of hanging in there hoping for improvement.So for me it's a fail on ergonomics - what about functionality? Well the mouse has two main buttons and a wheel on top plus the Windows button (in blue) and a thumb button. The wheel scrolls up/down and right/left plus is clickable. But programming choices are limited; in fact the blue Windows one has none at all: it opens the start menu in Windows 7 and goes to the desktop in Windows 8. Not good enough at this level sorry.As for wireless connectivity this brings up what I think is a huge missed opportunity: it's not Bluetooth. So right off the bat you're forced to use a (thankfully) low-profile dongle to connect - absurd in a world of Bluetooth-enabled laptops.Worse though it still suffers from the same shortcoming as every wireless desktop set I've ever tested: lag and dropouts. I still run into issues where the mouse is dead for a second before jumping around or the keypad doesn't recognize a button press (a BIG drag when you're using a calculator to add columns of numbers and it misses a digit-press). The only good news here is that when things get laggy a quick unplug/replug of the dongle cures it. But it shouldn't happen at all. Again not good enough Microsoft.So in the end there's a great keyboard on my desk that looks beautiful and feels quite nice. It has some issues and the mouse is useless to me - but the comfort of the thing means I'm still not going back to either of my other two main keyboards (a top of the line Logitech and an older mechanical key MS). Yet.
4,I've used a wide array of keyboards for decades now.  I wanted this one for its narrow profile (lack of numpad) despite it's mangled Ins/Del/PgUp/PgDn which is a pet peeve of mine and ungrouped F-keys.While many keyboards are just a matter of getting used to (indeed typing on it now) the one surprise I didn't expect was the toggle switch between F-keys and media/special.  It's pretty miserable using F1-F12 most of the time but needing to toggle Vol Up/Down then toggle back to avoid some random key when I try to use F1-F12 again.  I can see value in the toggle since some people use only one or the other but doing it in hardware seems an awful idea for those who use both sets.
3,I like the keyboard shape. However I bought the set with the mouse and the mouse is awful. It is a bad shape and it skips and can be hard to land a a specific spot on the screen (essential qualities in a mouse). Also if one breaks the whole thing need to be replaced. I'd buy the keyboard alone instead. Then buy a better mouse.
4,[edit below]I'm on day five with the keyboard after many years with the Natural Elite. Most of the reviews so far are spot on. I wanted to add:- The USB dongle is a bit bigger than I would have liked. It's about 2 cm long compared to 1/2 cm for most others I've seen.- Function keys are too small- I miss the full stroke of the Elite keys but I'm getting used to the new ones- It's MUCH more quite which is welcome. That was a big minus to the Elites.- Black color and wireless both welcome.I'm not going to comment on the mouse as I don't think I'm going to use it except as a backup. I bought a bunch of Explorer 3.0 years ago and have yet to see any mouse that feels as comfortable. The Wireless 4000 is my choice when I'm away from my desk.Purely coincidental that they are both MS products; they just happen to be what I've come to like in the last few years.Edit: Three months in and I really like the keyboard.One major concern is that the function keys tend to stick. This has meant battery drain if I'm away from the office for a while.
4,There are things to like and dislike in this latest evolution of the keyboard. The 'natural' keyboard has been around for quite a while now and while there is a little bit of adjustment in getting used to the layout of the keypads it isn't an overly daunting task.Likes- quiet keys- light weight compact keyboard (the numberpad is a separate included wireless device)- detachable keyboard support (I know it defeats that 'natural' position but I prefer the keyboard to lay flat rather than tilted)- decent range on wireless connection (I do not use a desk I HDMI my computer through the TV and drag the keyboard and mouse to my viewing position ~5-6 feet away)Dislikes- the mouse it's like holding a baseball sure it's usable and I may even get used to it but for now I find it huge and cumbersome when I'm used to devices like   Logitech Wireless Anywhere Mouse MX for PC and Mac (910-003040)        - function key switch rather than 'shift' key effectively disables one or the other use of these keys from casual useUltimately the dislikes are not annoying or detrimental enough to keep me from using the device in light of the keyboard's good features. P-)
3,I use one at home and have no issues and I use one at work and it has horrible connectivity problems. I think there is interference with other wireless keyboard / mice in the area or something like that. This means that I drop one or two letters per sentence. I really would prefer if this just had a wire. You have to plug in a USB doggle to use this so it's not like you are saving yourself any trouble with the wireless connection. The battery life is generally good but you still have to replace them a couple times a year. Overall the wireless "feature" is just pure hassle and no upside.A lot of people also mention the lack of 'fn' key that is a pain but it's relatively minor.All that said I love the layout and it feels much better than most ergo keyboards. I'll probably stick with it but if they released a wired version I'd buy it instantly.
4,I got this keyboard after I tried and returned the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic KeyboardThe pros:The keyboard is very comfortableThe keyboard is far quieter than most other keyboards I have usedThe space bar is divided into two keys which means that it takes the same amount of force and is the same volume as the other keys (the Microsoft Natural didn't have this and the space bar was hard to press and echoed through a quiet house)The cons:Not great for those who need to look at the keys when they typeThere can be a lag.  Most of the time it's fine but sometimes you have to hit the keys twice.The mouse is uncomfortable to use--I switched back to my old one.
3,Mac user and professional web developer here. I couldn't abide the flat wrist-destroying Mac keyboards anymore so I looked into more ergonomic solutions. I have used this keyboard/mouse for about 2 months on a mid-2014 MBP running Mac OS X 10.11.4.THE KEYBOARD:+ Nice looking+ Works just like a Mac keyboard if used with remapped keys (I use the free app Karabiner)+ Quiet and reasonably comfortable- Probably not an extreme enough solution if you actually want to preserve the health of your wristsThe main issue is that the curve of this keyboard comes up to only about one inch off the table at its highest point so it is still mostly flat. Typing doesn't feel all that different from using my old flat Mac keyboard and I'm not confident this will have any real benefits in the long term.THE MOUSE:+ Very comfortable natural wrist position+ Thumb buttons are responsive but firm enough that I rarely click them by accident- Even if I did click them by accident the thumb buttons are not mapped to anything on Mac. I have not explored a remapping option BECAUSE:- The mouse is laggy/choppy about 50% of the time and is damn near unusableThis very well could be an OS-related problem but I can't say for sure. I've tried several things including all the USB ports in my Macbook and all the ports in the monitor wired to my Macbook via USB. I've also tried turning off WiFi and bluetooth in an attempt to reduce channel interference but the mouse simply WILL NOT WORK for me unless it's literally inches away from the dongle. Maybe I have a faulty one or maybe it's an OS problem. It's a shame because from a strictly ergonomic standpoint the mouse is much more of an achievement than the keyboard.To be fair to Microsoft: The mouse's documentation only mentions support for OS 10.7-10.9 so I have no right to expect it to work on 10.11.4.That said I would suggest avoiding this mouse if you're a Mac user.I have this Anker vertical mouse at home that is cheap even more comfortable and works flawlessly:  Anker 2.4G Wireless Vertical Ergonomic Optical Mouse 800 / 1200 /1600DPI 5 Buttons - Black
4,Keyboard: 5 starsThis is by far the best keyboard I have ever used. It's a pleasure to type on. It's quiet and lets me type fast. The wrist rest is very comfortable and has a nice texture I have not seen in other keyboards. It's really nice to be able to remove the number keypad because it lets me center the keyboard in front of me without having to position the mouse way too far right.Mouse: 3 starsI'm just not a fan of heavy mouse and this one is a bit heavy for me. Most standard size wireless mice are heavy like this. Some mice allow you to remove one of two batteries in parallel to reduce the weight but this one requires two batteries in serial. I was hoping the new shape would make a positive difference but so far I'm not seeing it. I will try to get used to it a bit more but I will likely be going back to my trusty old Microsoft Intellimouse (not the Explorer version). I've tried several wireless mice from Microsoft and Logitech in the past two years but I keep coming back to the Intellimouse. If anyone knows of suitable wireless replacement please let me know!
1,There are a ton of pros with this keyboard so I'll just list the cons. A surprising amount of complaints about the keyboard were true but the ones that bothered me the most is that the palm rest did make my hands smell a bit after use (I do sweat a good amount). To combat this I bought a wrist pad I put over the built in wrist pad. Unfortunately this prevents me from using the magnetic piece that lifts the keyboard. The way the function keys have an alternate use and you activate them based on a switch is pretty horrible but I don't use them anyway. I don't like the way some of the keys are laid out but you'll get used to them eventually. Those are my only real complaints. I'm a long time MS ergonomic keyboard user and this is a big step from the previous model. I love the small footprint although I'd trade it any day for the older key layout. The keyboard is almost flawless I just need some time getting used to the layout.EDIT: My "W" key has been falling out for a while now. It finally stopped clicking back in. I'll be trying to return this to microsoft asap.EDIT 8/12/2019: I called MS support multiple times. I keep getting disconnected. I finally got someone to escalate my issue but the other people I spoke to told me that a key popping out is either wear and tear or I somehow damaged my keyboard by pushing on the key too hard or something. Either way they did NOT want to help me at all or take my case number to further the conversation. I'm very disappointed so far. I've dropped the rating to one star if a key popping out after a year of use is considered acceptable.EDIT: 8/19/2019: No help from MS...which I'm not horribly angry about. What I think is horrible is that their supplemental support told me that the key falling off my keyboard before a years time is acceptable wear and tear. A real shame. I guess I'm back to my old MS ergonomic keyboard. This will most likely be my last MS keyboard ever.EDIT: 7/4/2020 I've jury rigged a fix for my previous broken key with a small piece of metal and a ton of work. My W key still feels weird but now my D key started having the same problem months ago and has now suffered the same fate as my W key.
4,Great mouse and keyboard combo. I bought this for work and everyone thought it was a neat little keyboard. I always got compliments on it. But here in the past month of so the mouse has just been stuttering. I don't know why but changing the batteries didn't help at all. I am now using the Microsoft Wireless Comfort 5000 which I don't like as much but is a good alternative. Changing to this I do not have the stuttering problem that's why I think it has to do with the mouse itself.Other than that fault it has been wonderful. Once I got used to typing on it I could fly. I really love the separated number pad as I use it often and it feels really comfortable having it by itself.I'll probably try to go back to the set here in the future but if I have the same problem I will stick with the comfort.
5,I work on a variety of keyboards from the simplest straight layouts to laptops to ergonomic designs. Visits to clients have me used to making quick adjustments. For my own use I have focused on a number of the Microsoft ergonomic keyboards. The same for varied designs of mice. And I'm pleased to report the Microsoft Sculpt Desktop is the best experience I've had to date.The key response is gentle quiet and responsive. The travels are shorter than previous MS Ergonomic keyboards I've used but have the usual comfortable spacing between keys. The layout is slightly different so I am adapting to the location of the delete key home end and pageup and down keys. I see no trouble becoming used to the new layout.I have no particular feeling about the 10-key numeric keypad being separate. It works fine just as the joined layouts have worked for me in the past.I especially like the split keyboard angled for straight wrist positions and arcing upward towards the center. The layout feels so natural. This is my favorite attribute for the sculpt desktop. I do a lot of typing and I can't imagine this being better.At first I was concerned about the mouse being a little exotic with the buttons being shifted too far to the right (I am right-handed) but after a couple days it actually feels more natural than the mice with the buttons more to the left. I don't think it would work well for a left-hander. In the past I have had trouble with accidental pressing of thumb buttons on some wireless Microsoft mice but this isn't a problem with the Sculpt.I am pleased to report that although the keyboard specifies and came with 1.5V AAA alkalines and the mouse uses 1.5 AA alkalines 1.2V NiMH rechargeables work without difficulty. I thought the higher voltage might be needed if one was going to work at unusual distances from the included 2.4 GHz USB wireless transceiver but in both a normal desktop arrangement and working 15-20 feet from the transceiver it all worked fine. This is a big plus. Who doesn't hate buying new alkaline batteries just to the throw them away after one use.Summary: Excellent ergonomics wireless convenience and 1.2V rechargeable battery compatibility.
5,This is hands down the best keyboard and mouse combination I've ever used.  I've got several keyboards including an aluminum mac pro keyboard a 20 year old Silicon Graphics spring loaded keyboard that is similar to the classic metal IBM PC keyboard a wireless Apple keyboard and a few logitech keyboards.  I've also used the older Microsoft Natural keyboard and this keyboard is simply the easiest to type on.  Due to the minimal travel between keys and keystroke depths I can type faster and for longer periods without any pain in my hands (I'm a programmer so I spend most of my day in front of a computer terminal).  The only complaints I have about the keyboard are minor:  The function keys are really spongy buttons and you have to flip a switch to access the F# function keys.  I have one application that still uses a lot of function keys so that can be a bit annoying in just that application.  I still think the 6 key could have fit on the right hand but you get used to it being on the left hand quickly.  The detached 10-key to me is a wonderful thing as when I need to do a lot of numeric coding it's far more convenient to place the 10-key where I'd normally use my mouse without having the entire keyboard in the way.  Speaking of the mouse it is flawless.  It's very responsive and it fits my hand like a glove so again I no longer get any pain from using the mouse or keyboard over extended periods.  The battery life is quite good.  The mouse can last several months and I've had this keyboard for over a year and I've yet to replace the batteries in the keyboard or the 10-key.  If you spend hours a day typing this is the keyboard and mouse combination to get regardless of whether you use a Mac or a PC.
4,I've been using ergonomic keyboards for years and once you get used to them they are so much more comfortable than regular ones.Microsoft used to make a cheap white model -- the Elite -- which is still my favorite -- due to the east with which the keys depressed.  This is another update on that basic style:split middlesides that slope gently away from centerbig rest for the base of your hands etc.The black doesn't get as dirty as the white did which is nice.  But this is completely wireless and like all wireless devices has its disadvantages (slower less reliable needs batteries) and pluses (no wires to get in the way frees up ports).I like this keyboard a lot but still prefer a wired mouse and I much preferred the Elite which was half the price.However since that model is no longer available I'd say that on the whole this is still worth the price if you want to save your shoulders some tension and avoid carpal tunnel.
4,This keyboard and mouse are very comfortable and make my work day a lot better! Not super easy to clean but otherwise perfect. I just had one issue one day wearing a bracelet on my right hand and it started hurting with that mouse. So would recommend avoiding jewelry!
4,The keyboard uses Chiclet keys and works as expected.  The keys don't feel as mechanical as the Microsoft Ergonomic 4000 (membrane keys) but it is much quieter and has a good response.  It does lack some of the programmability features that the 4000 and 7000 have.  For the most part moving from the 4000 is seamless but people who use the home end page up/down keys will notice.  The mouse thus far has been a godsend.  I work at a desk all day long and the ergonomic mouse instantly feels better on my hand and wrist.I did see some reviews about the difficulty of changing the batteries because it uses screws and uncommon sizes.  My unit has magnetic battery plates so keep it away from children but it is very easy and convenient.My only complaint is the sacrifice of function for design by moving the home keys and detaching the number pad but I'm sure I'll get used to it with more time.
5,I'm using this desktop with Windows Vista. The product was clearly intended for Windows 7 and especially Windows 8 but works well enough with Vista.The keyboard is dome-shaped and very slim. It is split in the center with the two halves pitched toward each other so that when you place your hands on the keys they can be in a more natural position turned slightly toward each other with wrists rotated downward toward the outside. There is a built in wrist rest which is smooth and has just the right amount of cushioning to be comfortable but supportive. The space-bar is split as well. The keys have a sculpted slightly convex surface to accommodate your fingertips. They have a nice amount of smooth travel and excellent "clickiness."The keyboard comes with a riser which fits on its wrist side. This gives it a downward tilt--exactly the opposite of most other keyboards which have fold-out feet to give an upward tilt. Its use is optional. I couldn't get used to it and don't use it.The function keys have alternate uses controlled by a slide switch on the extreme top-right of the keyboard. Most of these alternates uses are for Windows 8 functions and do nothing in Vista. There is a calculator hot key which does work in Vista.The Number Pad is a separate unit. I like this because I seldom use it and can put it out of the way and then center the keyboard more easily in front of my monitor.The mouse is significantly larger than any other mouse I've ever used. To me it feels like holding a baseball. I think that Microsoft has done this so that they could put the thumb rest higher up on the side of the mouse than usual which in turn forces you to rotate your wrist slightly when mousing. It takes a bit of getting used to but after a while begins to feel very comfortable and natural. It is a wheel mouse and features tilt-wheel functionality in addition to the standard features.If you have Windows 7 or 8 you can download the "Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center" which will allow you to customize your new Desktop set. If you are running Vista or earlier you'll have to use 3rd party software to do this. X-Mouse is a good choice and it's free.
4,Love It! Absolutely love it. Only problem: removing the actual key covers and putting them back on is impossible. I had to buy a new one because I removed the backspace button and couldn't get it back on.
5,My main concern was compatibility with Chrome OS so after using the Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop with my Samsung Chromebook I decided to write a review highlighting just that.Keyboard:This is the most comfortable keyboard I've tried but you probably already knew that. Here are the functions keys which work with my Chromebook:The volume keys adjusts the volume no issues here.The tab selector (not sure if that's what it's called but it's the F10 key) switches between tabs just like holding ctrl+tab on the Chromebook.The PrtScn takes a screenshot just like holding ctrl+overview on the Chromebook.And for the surprise: the calculator button toggles immersive mode (i.e. full screen).As you can see there is no refresh back/forward overview or brightness adjustment on the keyboard. However the mouse can replace two of these functions.Mouse:This is a very smooth working mouse and I don't even use a mouse pad.  The back button well makes the screen go back one page so that works just fine. The Windows button however launches the 'Search/Apps' menu from the bottom left corner. Not bad!Overall I'm very glad I bought this set. I was not expecting the mouse function keys to work at all with Chrome OS but I am glad that it does. If there was one thing I could change it would be the USB adapter. To give you a reference point it sticks out about 3 times as much as the Logitech unifying receiver. I have dropped a laptop in the past where a USB adapter was sticking out and it bent right away so having a small USB adapter like the Logitech one is pretty convenient. I've uploaded a picture for comparison so make sure you check that out!
3,Very comfortable long battery life convenient single USB dongle for all three mouse keyboard and separate numpad... oh wait just one USB dongle and it's permanently paired... Lost or broke the dongle? Your whole $140 set is now bricked. Apparently there is no way around this. I contacted support walked into the Microsoft store searched the internet... it's hopeless.One day I left the dongle attached to my laptop and put it in my back pack. The next morning the dongle was dingled and no longer worked. Now all three components are apparently as good as garbage. Although I'll do my best to responsibly dispose of them. God knows we need more Microsoft products in the landfill.
2,I bought this for my birthday from Staples.  I'm taking this back to Staples.Initial store thoughts were:  The mouse feels great.  The keys are responsive.  This is finally the keyboard for me.After taking it home it showed its true colors.The left side of the keyboard feels flawless to type on ergonomically.  My hand is lifted up and the key striking feels natural.  The right side is a problem.  It's lifted up yes but where your hand has to move to strike keys to the right your fingers stretch out and become strained.  Almost more strained than if I were typing on a regular keyboard.And that's just the 'ergonomic' problem I have.  This keyboard should be Bluetooth.  That or wired with USB slots like the Mac keyboard in turn for taking a USB slot on my computer.  I like the ability to change between the FN keys and the keyboard's Microsoft special keys of volume control etc.  The volume control surprisingly works in Mac but misses a huge mark in not having a PLAY/PAUSE FORWARD and BACKWARD button.  The FN keys are also 'buttons' rather than keys.  Highly annoying when you're typing and the flow is disrupted by you having to click a button rather than press a key lightning fast.  Also the separate keypad is a plus and minus in itself..  It's good to have it loose and out of the way if you want to store it that way but on the other hand I use the ENTER button on it often and when the keyboard is together as one unit it's too large and takes up my mouse area.The 'suede' palm rest is another problem.  It should've been thicker.  It's only millimeters thick.  It also should not have been connected to the keyboard but a separate piece.  I do video editing and have my left hand always on the keyboard whilst the right hand mans the mouse.  The keyboard will rise up on the upper right because of the force on the left hand side.  Back to the thickness of the suede rest after twenty minutes that millimeter thick starts to creep into the uncomfortable category.  I could only imagine after months time this keyboard wouldn't be usable.  Now if it had a separate replaceable palm rest.......TO THE MOUSE.  Felt great in the store.  When I got home I noticed two problems:  where your index meets your thumb area of uncomfortableness and pinky finger location.  I have big hands so initially the mouse fits well.  There are not too many big hand mouses available.  After setting it up I noticed a pinching under my thumb where your index finger runs into your palm.  This is a mouse flaw design; they didn't continue the contouring design of the thumb area enough.  But the bigger issue is the pinky finger.  Because this is an 'ergonomic' mouse they turn your hand to the right instead of having your hand flat like most mouses.  Microsoft failed because the mouse is too small and didn't take into account your pinky forced off the mouse into to the table and run WITH PRESSURE on the table when you're moving the mouse.  On the birthday I asked my mom to check if her pinky touched the table when gripping the mouse.  Hers did.  So it doesn't matter if your hand is small or large you're screwed.  Microsoft should've tested this and raised the mouse higher.Also these guys run on batteries.  The keyboard takes AA's the mouse AA's and the keypad a watch battery.  Microsoft failed to include power switches on the keyboard and keypad.  So much for saving battery life.  Even the solar powered 750 I owned had an off switch.  It didn't need it but it had it.  Shame on you Microsoft.This was a great product as a pitch but fails to be spectacular in every way but my left hand.PROS- Keys have a nice responsive feel to them- Left hand is ergonomically flawless- Separate keypad- Only one dongle to tie these three togetherCONS- FN row aren't keys they're buttons forcing you to break your typing flow- Right hand typing is a mess- Separate keypad- Suede palm rest should be separate thicker- Left hand solo use (video editing) forces keyboard to rise on the right side- These should be Bluetooth it's 2014 (made in 2013)- Mouse is uncomfortable in two ways- Battery powered without ways to turn off devices and save life
2,As a long-term user of Microsoft Ergonomic Natural 4000 – I used it so long that keys have worn out and anybody else who tried to use the keyboard couldn't work out where Z was for instance – I was very excited to replace it with the Sculpt. Let's face it Sculpt looks fabulous just like Kim Kardashian at a gala but similarly to Kim Sculpt has its problems.Sculpt is a wireless keyboard. But unlike say Apple's keyboards it is not Bluetooth it comes with a tiny USB receiver which means that despite being wireless it still uses a USB slot. Alright I thought no worries. I plugged the receiver in the back of my computer and started using the keyboard. Some keys seemed harder to press. I figured out I had to hit them harder but 1) that was uncomfortable and 2) didn't actually seem to help much. So I thought I'd move the receiver to another slot from USB3 to USB2 and give that a shot. It worked for about five minutes then I encountered the problem again: keystrokes wouldn't register. Fortunately my computer stands on the desk and has USB slots on the front right part so I stuck the receiver there. At this point the distance between keyboard and receiver was about 80 cm. What do you know? IT STILL MISSED KEYSTROKES.In despair I put an old external drive that had a USB hub on top of a speaker (yes I know that's not an ideal spot for a hard drive) and stuck the receiver in one of the slots. The distance was about 50 cm (20 inches) and... Sculpt started to work. Except I don't really want to have an external USB drive constantly on so that I can use a keyboard. So I ended up buying an extension cable to place the receiver closer to the keyboard. I'll let this sink in for a moment. I bought a cable for my wireless keyboard. Yes. And now that the receiver is about 30 cm from the keyboard it works perfectly well. Except......for some reason today the Alt+S combo stopped working. I type in Polish and Alt+S is the internationally used combination to type a Polish character "ś" so this was pissing me off no end. I thought it was a software issue. I switched off all programs one by one. I rebooted twice. Then I went to a keyboard tester website and checked and everything but the ś worked perfectly. In the process I noticed F1 or F2 were... a bit stuck. When I hit them they got unstuck and all of a sudden Alt+S works again!At this point I am close to giving up and going back to my worn out Natural Ergonomic 4000 even though it takes enormous amount of space on my desk (the numerical pad of Sculpt is a separate entity which I immediately threw on a shelf with other things I don't use therefore Sculpt is tiny in comparison). The laptop-like keys of Sculpt and the... buttons that pass for function keys coupled with the fact I have a wireless keyboard with a cable make me really quite upset. This was supposed to make my life cooler not more frustrating.Pros:– it's damn sexy– small footprint– separate numeric padCons:– the receiver/keyboard connection is atrocious– stuck keys– I'd welcome a cable version to spare money on batteries since I need a cable anyway
5,I started using computers on a daily basis in 1979 and PC's in 1984. I went through a period of carpal tunnel syndrome which was mostly solved with the introduction of Microsoft's Natural keyboards in 1995. I've often preferred Logitech's keyboards. I tend to wear off some of the letters and smooth down the spacebar within 2 years. I'm hard on keyboards. I bought this Sculpt keyboard and mouse and have been using it about a week. I am a software engineer and type between 65 and 75 wpm. I use keyboard shortcuts for almost everything. Using a keyboard is my life.Positive Points: It is hands-down the fastest typing keyboard that I've ever used! I love the short stroke keys as opposed to the larger full stroke keys that were in the old Natural keyboard. The curve of the keys is correct for my hands and I like the long wrist pad on the front of the keyboard. I love the small function keys too.Negative Points: The new Insert Delete Home PgDn and PgUp layout is difficult to get used to though I can't think of an alternate layout that wouldn't increase the size of the keyboard. In a rare case of trusting Microsoft's engineering efforts I figure they've studied the heck out of it and concluded that this layout is the best compromise. Since I love the rest of the keyboard I'm willing to give the layout an honest try. I've almost learned to hit the large Delete key without looking but I still have to look for the others that are in a column on the extreme right side. I hope to find a touch-typing program that is customized for this layout to help me learn to touch-type those keys.Opinions on the Mouse: It takes about 2 days to get used to but then it is fine. I wish the scroll wheel would spin instead of notching through steps and I wish the Back key above the thumb was easier to get to but the rest of it is fine. It is a usable comfortable mouse and I have no problems with it. It works well and the wrist position feels right.
1,Update - Dropped to 1 star.In the 3 weeks i've been testing this keyboard I've discovered numerous issues.  The worst is the lag and skipped characters as mentioned below but then it got even worse.We use Skype for Business as our communication platform it work.  In Skype when typing an instant message to someone it would skip the first letter or maybe 2 then work like it was supposed to for the first week or so.  into the 2nd week it was missing numerous letters throughout the message.  I thought it was a fluke keyboard so i sent that one back for RMA and opened another one.  Same issues with it replaced the batteries with new and there was no change.  Thinking it may something on my system as it also started happening in Outlook 2016 i backed up my system and reloaded windows.  still has the lag and skipping characters after that.  I then disconnected the receiver and put my Logitech Unifying receiver in that USB port.  I can type in skype without any lag or missed characters whatsoever same with outlook.  For fun I switched back to the MS Sculpt and the lag and skipping letters returned instantly.  I also gave a brand new keyboard to my co-worker to test; he had the exact same issues.Purchasing dept. is returning all of the keyboards we orderedI ordered a few of these to test through my company.  I gave it 3 stars as it has a few quirks.Pros -Ergonomic.  It's a very comfy keyboard to use i like it better than the wired ergonomic keyboard from MS.Function key switch is a great idea.  I never can remember on other keyboards which way i have the function keys toggled until i hit one and go "woops i wanted F5 to refresh my screen not open search".  Now i can visibly see which function on the function keys are active.It's quiet!!  With the wired ergo keyboard from MS (and some of the logitech models) I can hear my co-workers in their cubicles around me typing away and the spacebar going clack clack clack.  With these Sculpt keyboards unless they're really pounding on the keys i can't hear them at all.It's compact i like that it's smaller i have more room on my desk now.Soft keys - they touch of the keys are soft takes less pressure than the wired ergo keyboard to use.CONS -it's wireless and unlike some of the logitech keyboards I've tested there can be a delay with this MS keyboard.  If the keyboard hasn't been used for a while and i go to open say MS Word to type sometimes it will miss the first few letters until the keyboard "wakes up" but then it will perform normally.Mouse - I totally hate the mouse.  Movement is smooth and precise but the feel of the mouse in my hand i just plain don't like.  It's too round and just feels weird I don't know how else to explain it. However it does make a cool looking paperweight.  So there's a good thing about it i guess.10 key pad "bugs" - I mentioned I like that i can move the 10 key pad around and save desk space.  They 10 key pad lag is even worse than the occasional keyboard lag i described above.  I have tried moving it to different positions on my desk so it's been closer or farther to the USB receiver but that didn't change anything.  I have to type a few numbers in the the 10 key then wait and if i'm lucky i'll get 1 of those numbers displayed on the screen then type a few more and use backspace to erase everything as it's all messed up then it will start working and i can punch in the number I need.  But as i use the 10 key pad it will skip a number here or there.  Typically we use 6 digit project numbers here and 5 digit barcode numbers. I'll finally get a 6 digit number typed in and maybe 3 or 4 sets later it will skip one of the numbers i type in from the set so i'll get like 13589 instead of 133589.  It's almost to the point of being unusable.  Just typing those 2 sets of number here in this review was a chore.  I had to type the 5 twice to get it to display in the first set and the 3's 5 or 6 times to get the 33 to show in the second set.What i do like about the 10 key pad (maybe the only thing other than it being not attached but that's also it's downfall) is the backspace key on the pad itself.  In the week and half I've been using this keyboard i'm surprised you can read the "backspace" letters on the key.
4,I purchased this keyboard to replace my Microsoft 4000.  While the keyboard is great the 10 key is the LEAST ergonomic thing I have ever used.  My wrist KILLS me when I spend any time at all using it.
4,Purchased this keyboard replacing a logitech that was not ergo.  Tendonitis and carpal tunnel made this purchase a must.  Really like the elevated wrist board (not the extra one that attaches with magnets; I move the keyboard around too much for this to be practical).  Love the separated 10-key.  Keep it close by for my line of work but you don't have to.  (Be careful when working with the battery in the back of the 10-key.  Do not overtighten the screw or the battery will not "connect")  Keys are easy touch and make only a "little click."  Appears to have reduced strain and pain!!HATE the mouse.  I require precise control for typing within templates and this mouse gave no control with or without a mouse pad.  Had to get an ergo logitech mouse.
4,With carpel tunnel problems the mouse is great for me .  With the software I use in my job about 60% is using the mouse and 20%entering numbers.  I find it awkward to constantly have to  locate the separate key pad and then find an arrow key with the other hand for entering a list of transactions.  Excel key combinations like “end – down” etc are harder to locate since the directional keys are not set by themselves and are not easy to locate by feel.I’m happy with it but if you are a heavy excel user you may be frustrated.  I’ve only had it for a few weeks so take my opinions knowing that I haven’t used it for  very long.
1,This was my favorite keyboard until I had all 3 of mine die a little after a year.  I used to own 3 sets 2 for home and 1 for work..The first failure was from the mouse the left button failed due to a tiny piece of plastic that holds the button that broke.  After that the button stuck and didn't have the rebound so failure.  Then about a month after that the keyboard left ctrl button started sticking.  I thought it might be a liquid that dried or something under the button.  Again it was an even more tiny plastic piece that holds the metal piece on the button.  Then other buttons started doing the same.  Tossed into trash...The 2nd keyboard on a different PC failed a little bit after the 1st one.  Both this and the other set failed just a hair after 1 year so no warranty...  The 2nd set mouse was fine but the buttons on the keyboard failed.  The ctrl button on the left hand side plastic piece broke.  Same issue different keyboard and albeit I'm still using this (and my work below) losing the left ctrl is extremely annoying...I have a 3rd set I got for work (well work got it for me).  The ctrl button is dead AGAIN... 3 times both my personals and now the work failed.  When the work one failed I felt compelled to write this review.  This excellent keyboard has quality issues BIG TIME... Needless to say I'm going back to my Ergo 4000 keyboard that is 6 years old and buying 2 more to replace the crappy Skulpts...EDIT: The OTHER ctrl button is now stuck this keyboard just keeps getting worse and worse....  In the trash bin...For how expensive these keyboards are I'd expect much much much better reliability... The fact ALL 3 have had failures just a few weeks to a month AFTER the warranty expired I have to say these are not very good keyboards and I highly recommend you do not purchase this set.  Also I didn't realize how important that left ctrl is I use it so much more than I thought... So now all 3 keyboards are crap...
4,compact keyboard and mouse - much smaller than I thought it would be...  great buy...
5,Wow !!!  Amazing materials and quality.  I am using this on a Macbook Pro and honestly i plugged the adapter in pulled out the free battery strips on everything and they just worked no driver stuff no nonsense.  The funciton keys on the top work for audio and etc...Pictures attached are how i use this keyboard on top of my Macbook Pro 2014 15" almost daily.  The mac is a nice keyboard but i have big hands and need ergonomic...  If you add the base clip and align it with the lowest point on the keyboard it does NOT touch the mouse pad and gives you an ergonomic keyboard for long sessions.  I carry the keyboard around in the laptop sleeve in the picture.  Laptop in laptop slot keyboard in its case and mouse in the side pocket no problems.  Just remember to take the battery out with is crazy easy with the magnetic cover and your all set.Keyboard is very nice quality a finish.  Magnets everywhere for all the caps and wrist base.  surprisingly also the keyboard with or without the stand fits on top of my Macbook 15.  I lay this on top and code away in comfort!!!!Only complaint......  CAN YOU PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE ONLY MAKE LED BACKLIGHTS ON YOUR KEYBOARDS FROM NOW ON !!!!!!!  A lot of people work at night or in dim light and it it's honestly frustraiting checking for keys when you need them in the dark.I know that is for all bluetooth keyboards and please dont give me the battery life issue LEDs will do the job of keeping the battery usage down.  :)  But besides that love it!!!!
4,I work from home as a legal secretary and have developed carpal tunnel syndrome from the repetitive typing.  I'm used to using a standard keyboard with a wrist rest but based on my painful wrists and numb and tingling fingers it's not working for me.  Since using this ergonomic keyboard is supposed to place your wrists in a more natural position I picked this up hoping I would see a difference and would be able to work pain-free.  It's definitely different and the odd wave-like shape will take some getting used to.  However if using this will relieve some of my pain it will be worth it in the long run.  I'm giving this a test drive to see how I like using it and will update my review in two weeks. I do like the separate number pad and the mouse is pretty cool.
3,I enjoy using that curvy egg of a mouse although I pressed the left mouse button too hard early on and may have broken an internal part. It still works several months after that and it slides across my polished wooden table. Unfortunately my sweat salts often stick to its glossy upper shell so it needs wiping down often. Battery life runs into a handful of weeks if not more.The numpad is comfortable to type on and can be put aside when I am not using it saving my desktop space. I do not like the feel of the num lock calculator and backspace buttons at its top though.Keyboard is elegantly shaped and ergonomic to me and my parents at least. It leaves my hands far apart just enough. It also has an almost laptop-like footprint great to put in front of a 15-inch laptop. However that means that the 6 function keys Home End Insert Delete and Pages Up and Down are crammed down the right flank so it can be quite a pain navigating Google Chrome and XnView with them. Also the 12 upper function/macro keys are quite small and are do not feel right them being built like the upper 3 keys of the numpad. The wrist cushions are comfortable to rest my wrists on but after about 6 months of daily use they have worn some till the hard plastic beneath can be felt.Num Caps Scroll and Fn toggle keys work normally - usually. Except for the mechanical Fn toggle there is often a slight delay between the on and off toggle states and there are no indicator LED for them - all of them appear as little icons on screen and sometimes they do not even appear! When that happens I have to press a key to know whether Num or Caps Lock is on or off!I am not satisfied with its battery life. On Energizer Alkaline and IKEA Alkalisk the top 2 best performing batteries on this keyboard the keyboard lasted 7 to 9 days before going kaput but even 5 days in not long before the red low energy indicator light comes on the keys to letters 'E' 'R' and 'T' and number 3 become irritatingly unresponsive. Typing becomes a chore as I have to hold down those keys for up to 12 seconds just waiting for them to come up on-screen while every other key is still working.This is a wireless ergonomic membrane switch keyboard-and-mouse combo with a separated numpad. If you are suspicious about buying this try looking for an older Microsoft Natural Keyboard 4000 or earlier.
5,I am an IT professional and my wife works in a customer service center for a large financial firm. Between us we own four of these desktop sets one for work and one for home for each of us. Three of the sets include the mouse with my home set being keyboard only as I have a separate mouse I prefer for gaming. My wife also used her first set at work for many months and liked it so well she insisted on a second set to use on her home workstation.I've been using mine at work for well over a year eight to ten hours a day with absolutely no issues with the keyboard mouse. The numeric keypad started giving me a bit of trouble several months back but it turned out that the battery wasn't making good contact. I ended up putting a small bit of folded post-it note paper on the battery under the cover. This was just enough added thickness to insure the battery couldn't wiggle loose and fixed the problem completely. I'm also an avid PC gamer and have put in many hours on the keyboard I have at home. I really like the sculpt mouse for work as it fits my hand well and never causes fatigue even on long days.I've used Microsoft "natural" keyboards since they brought out the Natural Keyboard in 1994 and have owned every one or more of Microsoft's ergonomic models over the years. The last two iterations of the product the 4000 and 7000 seemed to lower product quality comfort and features however the Sculpt desktop set revitalizes their line. I heartily recommend this product.
3,Worked well for about 5 months then the mouse’s left click Button started failing needs to be pressed very hard defeating the purpose of buying an ergonomic mouse
3,Ive had this for about 4-6 weeks. I was really excited to use this combo. The mouse takes some getting use to but feels great.  I love the sound of the keyboard nice and light. This has worked great until recently. If I dont use the number pad i have to reconnect it. Sometimes it works sometime not. The keys are starting to stick. Its random. Its getting annoying and now I have to look for another keyboard.  Not worth the money.
2,I expected to really like this keyboard but the quality is unacceptable particularly at this price.I've used a Microsoft Natural Ergonomic 4000 keyboard for a long time and wanted to switch to a wireless model.  At first glance this one seemed like a great choice.  It's attractive has a nice palm rest and has a comfortable angle for typing.  The magnetic battery covers and stand are a nice touch.  Best of all the keys have a nice feel for a non-mechanical keyboard and require less pressure than my old 4000 ...Well most of the keys.On my first try I found that the slash key and the tab key sometimes didn't register unless I pushed all the way down (as if I wanted to repeat the keystroke).  I returned this keyboard and exchanged it for another (both purchased at BB not Amazon).  This time the slash and backspace keys were just fine but the single quote key had the problem.  I'm not trying a third time.  Done.Some other issues:1. Why is the escape key sooooo tiny?  I'm a programmer and I use vi all the time which means I use the escape key all the time.  Not good but would not have been a dealbreaker.2. No LED to indicate the caps lock is on.  Are you kidding me?!  Am I the only one that occasionally hits the caps lock instead of the shift key?  Solved with a $.99 app from the Apple store but annoying nonetheless.3. The mouse is not very comfortable despite it's billing as "ergonomic".  It's too big too glossy/slippery and despite trying various grips doesn't seem to have a sweet spot.  I would not have continued using it.The design (of the keyboard not the mouse) is good enough to earn 2 stars despite the quality issue.  If you use the keyboard sporadically it might be fine for you.  I would give it 4 stars when and if MS solves the quality issues.
1,I do not recommend this product. Shame on Microsoft!  If your Dongle (the little metal/plastic piece that you put into the side of the computer to connect your wireless keyboard to your computer) gets damaged or lost you can NOT replace it. You are out $80-$100 and then have the task of how to "properly" get rid of it.  I am disgusted and feel ripped off. I will never buy another Microsoft product.
1,I purchased this set for my work laptop and I have had it for 6 months.  My receiver malfunctioned and the whole set is now useless because you can't order a replacement receiver.  All 3 items work on one receiver so I now have 3 paper weights handy. This one issue has turned what could have been a 5 star rating to a 2 star rating.  As for the set I have described each of the pieces belowKeyboardI love the split keyboard.  I went from a standard flat keyboard to the split design and I have never looked back. It is easy to use and relieves the stress that typing all day can have on your hands and wrists. It uses AAA batteries which I always have on hand.10-Key PadI like how the 10-key pad is movable and I can access the computer calculator with a push of the button.  However it didn't live up to my expectations because it does not have a Tab key.  This would be a perfect if MS would put a tab key on the pad itself so that you can push the keyboard aside when you are typing a large amount of numbers in a spreadsheet.  As it is I have to keep the keyboard close by my left hand so I can 10-Key with my right hand and then press the tab key with my left to go from cell to cell and this is a PAIN.  Seriously if you are going to have a separate 10-Key pad put a Tab/Enter button on it.  It also uses a watch battery which I DONT have handy and I have to make a special trip to the store when the battery dies.  So batteries and no Tab/Enter button is a big negative on this.MouseThe mouse is OK.  It does fit my hand pretty well and I love that there is a place to rest my forefinger.  The responsiveness of the mouse leaves something to be desired.  There are times when I have to click twice where normally I would only click once.  It is as if the mouse didn't recognize the first click.  This wasn't the way it was when I first bought the set but has slowly gotten worse as time goes by.So from a user standpoint the set is pretty good especially for ergonomic aspects of the keyboard and mouse.  However from a consumer standpoint this set doesn't make any sense to purchase again.  I have looked around and I am going to be purchasing a Logitech wireless keyboard and mouse that I have already confirmed has a replacement receiver available if needed.  MS has really missed the customer satisfaction and repeat business with this set.  I am very careful with my equipment and the receiver going out was not through neglect or abuse so I can't recommend this product to anyone.  If you want to invest in a quality wireless keyboard and mouse for the long term look elsewhere.
3,I've been a great fan of Microsoft's "Natural" line since the beginning. I've just switched from the "4000" model in which the only real flaws were integrated numeric pad (I used it extensively but it was not ergonomic at all) and perennial problems with Alt keys (the right one is commonly used to type in Polish-specific letters; I managed to avoid frequent problems with the space bar though.)The general concept and quality of the keyboard seem great but some absurd design decisions made this one pretty much unusable for me. I could even accept narrow and misplaced function keys how ever nonsensical it is (they saved what 0.3"?) and that they behave more like buttons than keys. I could do without multimedia buttons (they are integrated into F1-F12 now but it makes them completely impractical particularly now when they have to be switched on by a switch not a standard key). What makes this keyboard pretty much unusable for me is lack of cushioning on the very edge of it (which to make things worse is far from flat) combined with slightly narrowed wrist pad compared to it's predecessor (again for what 0.25"?). The thing is one of my carpal bones lies directly on that edge if I stop typing for a moment.So if this keyboard was just a few milimetres wider (vertically) and had the same amount of padding the "4000" model has it would be the best keyboard ever made. Now it seems to be quite the opposite. And believe me my fingers are not that long at all I've got pretty much standard man's hand.The mouse could be bigger as well since my carpal bone touches the desk with the same force it does when I use Logitech's Performance MX mouse so the main supposed (?) advantage is gone. Again I really don't have big hands. I also noticed the Start button doesn't work if pressed lightly on it's edge (it clicks but nothing happens.)Update: I crafted some sort of solution: carefully cut oval-shaped pieces of black foam from a mouse pad which I'm going to attach to the wrist pad. It won't even look that bad after all. Anyway unsuitability for even medium-sized hands and the simple fact that it's a step back from the predecessor in this respect combined with the apparent motivation from the designers (and the ridiculously small amount of space they saved by narrowing the pad and the Fn keys for some questionable aesthetic reasons) still don't let me give it more than three stars. As I said: for small hands (or medium ones after some alterations to the wrist pad) and typing only (provided one doesn't use Fn keys extensively in text editing for example in Word.)
5,I've been a fan of ergonomic keyboards ever since Microsoft introduced their first one--despite the weird looks I got from practically everyone who looked at it. Worse yet their reaction to actually using it on rare occasions was one of villification of me like I cheated them out of two minutes of their life that were gone forever and unretrievable.Like everything else in life the novelty of the layout required a brief adjustment period; once mastered though I've never looked back! In fact I liked it so much that I ran out and bought the next generation for my office at work. To date with rare exception I've had one at work and at home. If you purchase one (I endorse the Sculpt model shown here) and allow yourself the necessary adjustment period you'll never go back. The level of comfort (to say nothing about the lack of carpal tunnel pain) is astounding!About six months ago my coffee mug (full of course) tried to type something and made it down into the circuitry of the keyboard frying it. My wife and I decided to use the keyboard that came with the computer. Yesterday I flipped out enraged at the standard keyboard. I calmly removed the wire from the computer stood up approached and opened the window for the 2nd story room. I then mustered every ounce of strength that I could and threw the keyboard as hard as I could onto the sidewalk below thus shattering it! My wife after seeing it fly through the air applauded my decision and subsequent result as she was as fed up with the standard as I was. That's funny because when we got our first one she complained to anyone who would listen--including the dogs--about the terrible decision I made in purchasing that first ergonomic keyboard! After we settled down from the excitement of the demolition she promptly handed me a crisp $100 bill and asked me to get the newest Microsoft ergonomic keyboard Staples had in their inventory (this one); she even said what she thought its name was--the "Sculpture".
3,These were great one I got used to the ergonomic shape. Unfortunately the wireless USB plug keeps falling apart and losing signal. I have to change it to a new USB port multiple times a day when my keyboard & mouse stop working. I've now lost signal completely. It's great for personal use maybe but did not last at my office. Super disappointed. Will look into hopefully getting a new USB connector since the keyboard and mouse are still in good condition but no idea if that's even possible.
3,I love this keyboard. And I’m on here buying my 2nd one. The biggest drawback is the stupid dongle. You cannot but a replacement if it gets lost or broken. So beware. Great product otherwise!
3,I'm late to the game here but thought I'd weigh in. I absolutely LOVE this keyboard. Used it for about a year with OSX and experienced no issues whatsoever but then I broke the USB dongle. The fact that the entire keyboard (and mouse if you have it) must be replaced because the (relatively flimsy) USB dongle stopped working is ASININE. Talk about a waste of money and materials. Thanks yet again Microsoft for ruining a potentially wonderful product.
4,This Microsoft ergonomic set is all about comfort and I have to say that the keyboard is indeed excellent especially with the separate number pad not to mention that I could not feel any delay at all when operating any of the three components. Also worth mentioning is that the material is a glossy piano black plastic and seems to attract dust rather easily. All in all I would definitely recommend the keyboard for purchase whereas I would hold off buying the mouse and opt for a better one with more functions.Review I used before buying this keyboard set - http://www.emeraldvolt.com/microsoft-sculpt-ergonomic-keyboard-and-mouse/
3,I used (and loved) the MS ergonomic keyboard of the mid-to-late 1990s. In the store where I purchased this the display model felt similar so I bought the Sculpt. (And paid more than I needed to now that I see Amazon's price.)I love the mouse. It's a little large for my hands but I love the ease of using this mouse.I love the number pad. The keys feel right. I'm not sure how to put that into words besides saying this "feels right" but... yes I love the number pad.The keyboard itself... I don't know who designed and tested this but they must have had much larger hands than mine. Or they didn't mind having to look down at the keyboard to hit things like "Backspace."The regular letter keys are fine. Within a couple of hours of using this I was accustomed to the basic keyboard. (Well mostly. I'm still making enough typing errors to be a little frustrated.)However I'm getting a cramp in my right wrist from the stretch to reach the backspace key. Another reviewer -- who left a one-star review -- had the same problem: This keyboard seemed to be designed for someone with a far greater reach. If I leave my right index finger on the J key I can just barely stretch my fingers to reach the backspace key.The "bridge" of my hand (across the top of the knuckles) measures about three inches or slightly more. When I buy gloves (kitchen or winter gloves) I nearly always need them in size Large or L/XL. So I don't think my hands are especially small for a woman.I may return this keyboard to the store. I'll use it one more day and see if the wrist issue improves or if I become less annoyed at having to stop and look at the keyboard when I pick up my hand to reach the backspace key. Until now I've never had this kind of discomfort in my wrist even with a traditional flat keyboard. It's enough to make me stop using this unless I can break the habit of reaching for the backspace key with my little finger... expecting to find a key that isn't anywhere close.Other than that the packaging was a little difficult to open but not awful. The installation (via Windows 7) was a breeze even without following the instructions. (The wireless USB hardware is easily removed from just inside the mouse and works best on the front of the computer not the back.) I miss the lights that tell me if I have caps lock or numbers lock on but I can get used to that.The reach required to use this keyboard comfortably...?  I'm not optimistic.I think this keyboard could be great if it came in a couple of sizes. In my opinion this keyboard is not a "one size fits all" design.
5,I purchased this keyboard/mouse combo in 2015 locally at a retailer here in Kansas City MicroCenter. They price match Amazon and I needed the item quickly. I've been happily typing clicking and navigating for over 3 years on this seriously *SLICK*   Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Wireless Desktop Keyboard and Mouse        . It is the most comfortable keyboard and mouse I have ever used due to its unique elevated wrist rest which allows the user to rest their hands downward while they type. This extremely helpful for me at work as my wrists do tend to hurt about half-way through the work day. I've been in IT 20 years.$81.99 currently here on Amazon (7/24/2018)... I recommend you not even waste your time with the now tragically cheap Logitech wireless combo "solutions." See my review of their two products I bought and tested before finding the right solution by Microsoft:My dissatisfied review of the   Logitech MK710 Wireless Keyboard and Mouse Combo        https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38NIDQF2UL42C/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0036E8V08
3,This set works great while it works.  The mouse left button starts to have issues after about 2 years.  You would have to click on it multiple times for it to register.  Microsoft support is great and they replaced the mouse twice already over a span of 5 years.  They really need to fix the mouse button issue.  I gave it a 3 stars instead of 2 because of Microsoft's warranty.
5,I was provided this keyboard Package at no cost to test few months ago. Here are my thoughts on this beast after two months of use:The Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard and Mouse Set L5V-00001 is a very comfortable to use addition to a computer workspace. The separate number pad allows for greater flexibility for placement although it takes some time to get used to it. It’s made for Windows 8 but tested with windows 7 and all new windows 10 Beta version. Works fine on all three with no driver compatibility issue.The whole set is dependent on USB dongle (included) and requires some downloaded software to function and allow customization. Nevertheless the USB dongle is surprisingly easy to break (if you got kid in the home) and is coded to work only with that one keyboard and mouse. So if it breaks the keyboard and mouse becomes useless. You would have to buy another set to be able to use it again. That is why I wish it also had Bluetooth capability.░░░░░PRO'S░░░░░❖ Easy to set up❖ Extremely Comfortable Design❖ Long Battery Life❖ Windows 8 Navigation Features❖ Separate Number Pad - I LOVE this feature.░░░░░CONS░░░░░❖ USB Dongle is Fragile and no replaceable░░░░░BOTTOM-LINE░░░░░I will recommend this as an excellent keyboard and mouse.

3,comfortable key are great but at least once i week it goes rogue and starts ghost writing....well it's like a key gets stuck and i have to shut down my whole laptop to make it stop.  Once it started deleting emails.  Very strange.  Googled it faulty keyboard.  that being said i'm probably going to get another one as it really helps with wrist strain.
3,The shape and aesthetic of the keyboard and mouse both are pretty great. The space between the two halves of the keyboard is great to speed up typing and improve accuracy. I really want to like this set but only about a week in the rubber grip for the mouse began to rub off. Now the separate number pad intermittently cuts out and replacing the battery does not fix the issue. The number pad is kind of the last straw so I am going to have to replace this after only a few months of use.
3,This second attempt at this product and some of the keys produce incorrect text.a few examples:an apostrophe is :the at symbol (shift 2) is "the equal symbol is ^who do I contact for issues like these?
3,Comfortable keyboard till an year later the backspace key started malfunctioning and deleting bunch of emails at random times as well as words you just typed. Changing the batteries didn't help.  I'll probably just have to buy another one since it's quite comfortable and small and looks slick.
5,Most comfortable and compact without being miniature. Good wrist support with cushion. The best board !Works with mac book OS 10.15.5. I learnt this after trying this out of curiosity and it worked with the mac os. The reviews said that it won't work with newer OS releases which is incorrect !So one can keep this same 'best' mouse for win and mac
4,I had been using my previous keyboard for more than 10 years and I was looking for a new one. My son found it for me. I am not a tech person at all but it is fairly easy to set it up and use it. I did not think that I needed a “fancy” keyboard but I have gradually grown to appreciate the design and soft touch keyboard. I am still not used to using a separate numerical pad so that is a little bit challenging for me.
3,By way of disclosure I received a sample of the Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop for evaluation purposes.  I have endeavored to keep that fact from interfering with my review of this product.The desktop includes four pieces: 1) a wireless keyboard; 2) an optical wireless mouse; 3) a wireless numeric keypad; and 4) a USB dongle receiver.I am using this product with a computer I built myself a few years ago.  It's based on an AMD Phenom II x4 965BE processor and runs Windows 7 Professional 64 Bit.  I have been using the product for about a month now in an office environment.I have used various keyboards over the years principally from Microsoft and Logitech including mechanical switch keyboards gaming keyboards the Microsoft Natural keyboard and the Logitech Illuminated keyboard.  I learned to touch type in high school and type documents on a regular basis in my work.My initial impression was that this Microsoft set is a bit pricey for what it is.  The keyboard itself is a split ergonomic design.  The keys vary in size as you get close to the center of the keyboard with the N key being quite massive.  It has an integrated wrist rest that feels like fine suede but which is probably composed of rubber with some kind of foam underlayer.  The wrist rest is not detachable.  I find that it has become quite discolored after only about a month of use -- in an office environment it isn't easy to wash the wrist rest and it appears to be collecting sweat and dead skin (gross!).  That said the wrist rest is comfortable.  I do not know how long it will last however.  It would be nice if it were removable.Speaking of removable the keyboard has no adjustable legs in the back making it unlike most keyboards I've ever used.  Instead it has a big piece of plastic that magnetically fastens under the FRONT of the keyboard elevating it and putting your hands and arms into greater alignment easy the strain on your wrists and possibly helping to avoid posture that fosters carpal tunnel syndrome.  In all I find the keyboard quite comfortable to type on; however even after a month of regular use I have not become fully accustomed to the odd key spacing or locations of some of the keys that usually are configured differently at the right side of the keyboard.  In other words I find that the layout of this keyboard presents significant accuracy issues for my typing.The key feel is adequate similar to many laptop keyboards.  The keys aren't tall and strokes are relatively short compared to those on more traditional keyboards.  When I type quickly I do not encounter ghosting problems.I found the function keys and escape keys annoying.  They are tiny and do not feel well constructed. They feel like they will pop off.  They do not have the same soft touch as the rest of the keyboard.  What is more there is no dedicated "Function" or "Fn" key to permit you to use the second function for the function keys (e.g. adjusting volume via the F3 and F4 keys).  You have to throw a flimsy mechanical switch at the top right of the board to the "Fn" position.  This is a chintzy design feature that was not well thought out.The mouse is comfortable to use and tracks well for office use though I wouldn't ever try to use it for gaming.  It has the usual right and left M1 and M2 buttons.  It has two additional buttons.  One is the blue Window button on the top of the mouse away from any place where you would likely press it accidentally.  By default it calls up the START menu in Windows 7.  The other button is a "browser back" button on the left side of the mouse in the rubberized and sculpted thumb recess.  It is under the rubber but you can feel where it is without any issues.  The mouse is easy to grip in light of its rounded shape and rubberized thumb rest.  However there is a materials issue here again.  After only one month of use the rubberized thumb rest is wearing out and getting slick and shiny where the "browser back" button is located.  It is much less pleasant feeling now.  I don't know how much longer this non-removable rubber will last before it wears through or ruptures.  You can replace the AA cells in the mouse by removing the magnetically connected gliding ring on the bottom of the mouse and you can switch the mouse off with a mechanical throw switch on the bottom of the mouse.The numeric keypad is unremarkable.  It's nice to be able to put it aside when you don't need it.  However the supplied coin battery in my evaluation unit has died in less than one month.  That seems atypical and I wonder whether there was a problem with the battery or a key sticking down on the keypad that caused a significant power drain.I have had no problems with the connection between the keyboard mouse or keypad and the computer.  The basic software Microsoft offers to allow you to change the function of the mouse buttons is adequate and unremarkable.In all this desktop is comfortable to use.  There are some design quibbles I have with the keyboard especially the lack of a Fn key and the odd placement of the various keys on the right side of the board.  I also question the materials Microsoft used which do not seem durable at all.  For the price I would expect something that would appear to offer a greater useful product life.
4,I use these at work for many of my staff take a while to get used to but then its excellent the separate mouse pad is great as i rarly use it though finance finds it less useful as it floats off with constant number entry.The negatives are that we have had one sticking key in 4 months and broken 2 radio transmitters - they are quite flimsey- i don't yet know if we can get replacement transmitters on their own.But its still a good keyboard and i'd spend my own money on it...
3,For daily typing it works fine. I don't really like how shallow the key push is but it's probably better for your hands. Why it's only getting 3 stars is due to the fact that the 10-key is horrible! It will constantly miss numbers even when already typing so I don't think it's a sleep/wake issue. It just doesn't seem to catch all the type keys. I think it would be easier if it were also attached to the keyboard. I have another ergonomic keyboard that has the 10-key attached and it works fine when it comes to the design. It isn't however a cordless like this one.
1,I find the home finger position of this keyboard to be a major PITA.  I am constantly mistyping due to the key positions.  SUCKS.  Getting rid of it.
2,The keyboard feels awesome and I love the additional prop to adjust the angle.  The keys are also very smooth and these are features I would keep for the next iteration.However the mouse is a different story.  I have petite hands and the mouse is simply too big to let my fingers naturally rest and reach the "buttons".  In order to get to that position I have to change the angle of my hand such that my wrist is bent at an even greater angle than a traditional mouse.  Ouch!  I had the worst pain in my thumb and forearm after one day's use.  It was horrible.  To me it appears this mouse was designed for a user with an average medium-to large sized hand and I'm sure it works great for those users because I see such wonderful reviews!Connectivity was also a problem.  I had many lags where the keyboard would not type then suddenly it would connect again mid sentence.  Quite frustrating and not functional for my typing needs.I know Microsoft values designing products to enable all people to achieve more; I really hope to see an ergonomic mouse design for those with petite hands soon!
3,Stuff you should know (not necessarily cons just different):* This keyboard will not tip up (there are no pop out tabs in the back and the optional support lifts the front not the back). I found this to unnatural for me.* The mouse seems to be angled to the right so your thumb is actually quite high up on the left. I'd prefer it to be a little more level.* The mouse does have a back button in addition to a windows key (I didn't see that at first). I'm glad it does.* The 10 key number pad uses a watch battery instead of AAs like the keyboard and mouse... Not a problem until it finally dies and you don't have a spare.* They did away with the Fn lock button and have an Fn switch this is great if you want to know what mode it's in and don't like software switching it.* The transmitter is stored under a plate on the bottom of the mouse. This plate is held on with a magnet. Both sides of the plate look like they could be the bottom but the magnet won't engage unless you put it on the right way. It too me way to long to figure this out.CONS:- I've used a lot of MS comfort curve and natural ergonomic keyboards but this one seems to make the backspace key a fraction too far for me to reach while touch typing... and I make way too many mistakes for that.- This wireless setup won't let me Windows 8 machine go to sleep the screens turn off and then they pop right back up. It's like the mouse is always shaking... When I switch out the keyboard and mouse the system goes to sleep fine. I'm sure there's some patch or software that will fix this (at least I hope so) but this is a MS kit and MS Windows... they should just work out of the box together.PROS:+ The ergonomics of the rest of the keyboard (other than the backspace and other Home/Ins/Delete/Etc. support keys) are quite good and the chick-let style keys are an improvement for both noise and accuracy.+ The separated number pad is really useful since it can be stored/used further to the right than the keyboard... This allows for rapid two handed input of numbers with one hand on the arrow keys and one entering numbers at comfortable distances from each other.Overall if you're already used to the Microsoft split keyboard and if you have larger hands (mine are smallish guy hands) so that the backspace isn't too far away then this keyboard is perfectly usable perhaps even more enjoyable due to the new keys detachable keypad and FN switch. But for me there are so many small discomforts like the lack of a rear lift option the strong mouse angle the distant backspace key and the less than perfect integration with my PC that I feel like the ergonomic benefits are greatly diminished.
3,This is a very comfortable keyboard and looks really nice as well.I love everything about this keyboard with the exception of dropped keys. Often when starting to type the first key I press will be ignored. Less occasionally random keystrokes will also not come through.I thought that it may have been a bad batch so I returned the keyboard and got another one. The new one still drops keys.
2,I borrowed a friend's sculpt ergo set and used it exclusively for a week. I've owned the previous 2 models of microsoft ergo keyboards and LOVED them but I definitely didn't "love" this one. I'd summarize my experience by saying that on the surface it's good even very good being the only split keyboard design I could find that also had the lovely short-throw chiclet-style keys apple users have come to know and love. However there are too many dealbreakers for me to recommend. Fingers crossed this split/chiclet combo catches on because it's the right direction imho.So here are my hopefully impartial pros and cons from my week in microsoft land:Pros:1. The split keyboard experience while awkward at first is a really pleasant one once you get the hang of it. In my experience and in the opinions of many it reduces wrist strain which is really important if it really does for you. Your Mileage May Vary on this but it's definitely worth a try if you haven't before.2. The action on the chiclet-style keys (flatter laptop-ish style) is very nice. Mac users all can relate - it's just less strain on the wrist and faster. This microsoft keyboard was at least on par with the apple keyboards in this respect which is saying a lot.3. The materials feel high-quality and are really nice to touch all day for hours on end. The use of magnets for attaching the battery cover etc was a very nice touch.Cons:1. Dealbreaker - the delete/enter/shift/arrow keys are almost impossible to find if your hand isn't already on the keyboard without stopping what you're doing and looking down to find them. I honestly never realized how important that was before this week or what it was that even allowed me to find those keys so easily before but I know now! All other keyboards I've used had those critical keys at the right edge of key groupings making them almost automatic to find without looking just by feel. With the sculpt ergo keyboard there's two columns of keys between the edge of the keyboard and the enter key which made it almost impossible for me to consistently find it without looking if my hand wasn't already on the keyboard to begin with. Instead every time I had my hand on the mouse and needed to hit enter I'd either have to try doing it blindly and pressing randomly (and usually miss) or failing that would have to stop what I was doing look down find the key look back up find what I was looking at press the key then move on. If you're not a touch typist then you're accustomed to doing this all the time anyways so this won't be a dealbreaker for you. But if you are a touch typist well this is just unacceptable a total fail and a surprising one at that since Microsoft has historically nailed button placement on past keyboards I've used.2. Almost a dealbreaker - The function keys are awful. Starting from the left this includes Escape and then several keys that Mac people make extensive use of - expose/dashboard/volumne etc (note: yes I was using this on a mac as well as a pc!). I found consistently pressing any function key to be a pain because frequently they wouldn't register. I think the main reason is because I'm a touch typist and have learned how hard to press keys and so having different keys that take more force is really disruptive. Specifically these keys are made of a different material than the rest of the keys they're smaller they're lower and worst of all they're harder to harder press (and when you do press them they make a gross-sounding plasticy "click" sound instead of having a normal key-press action like the rest of the keys). So all this to say - if you make extensive use of these keys you will notice this very quickly and it will probably irritate you. I suppose having all these differences about these keys helps prevent you from pressing them by mistake and if that were the only goal with these keys then huge mission accomplished! But accidental function key presses has never been a problem for me and I press those buttons with great frequency so having them behave differently not register half the time and feel like garbage well that's just no bueno.3. The mouse - I found the optional mouse to be ... unpleasant. It somehow felt too big and yet at the same time too small. I guess just the wrong shape for my tastes. By the end of the week I was putting my thumb and palm in extremely unorthodox positions just to try to squeeze some more accuracy out of what was otherwise an experience akin to precisely moving a cursor using a softball. I'll take my logitech m705 every time over this - free-spinning mouse wheel momentum and proper hand ergonomics for the win!So that's my take on it. I encourage anyone interested to try it and make up your own mind. Who knows you may find the pros are even better than you expected and the cons don't factor in at all. The bottom line is that broken-layout keyboards do reduce wrist strain so if this keyboard works for you I encourage you to go for it. Sadly I'll be waiting for the next one to come along.
5,I work as a developer and use my keyboard all day long. I've tried many different styles of keyboard but this was the first time I tried using a split keyboard. After a couple of days using it I became very fast at typing. Most of the buttons are exactly where I want them to be I'm still surprised by how little I need to move my fingers while typing. It's also helped push me to use more keyboard shortcuts because moving you hand over to the mouse takes a few seconds to reset in the right position compared to a standard keyboard.The design is great its soft in the right places and smooth everywhere else. It's appropriately small but my hands feel like they have much more room than my previous keyboard. I've experienced a few times where the keyboard connection lags but I believe its related by system settings and USB power timeout.I typically use the keypad but since this one is detached I've grown used to using the keys on the actual keyboard and I use an Anker vertical mouse at my workstation so i did not purchase this with the mouse included.
5,Important Tip: Install the usb dongle when the computer is turned off. I ended up with a completely unresponsive mouse and keyboard by making that error and ended up having to manually shut down my machine. Works great now though!My uncle sent this to my mother as a birthday gift and the rest of us loved it so much we all added it to our wishlists. I've had it on my computer for about two days and so far I absolutely love this thing. It's not easy to find a decent ergonomic keyboard and add in the wireless requirement and well yeah it tends to be tough. The mouse is surprisingly comfy to use - I honestly didn't think it would be so nice based on the visual appearance but it's the best feeling mouse I've ever used - feels incredibly natural. This keyboard is replacing another ergonomic keyboard (wired) with a similar layout but those small differences seem to be making a difference. I haven't yet done a marathon day (+12 hours) so I haven't yet put it through full paces but so far I'm really liking this.
3,The typing experience and ergonomics are superb. Here are the reasons why I am giving it 3 stars:- It requires the following batteries: two AAA two AA and a watch-style battery.- Whenever any of those batteries expire work is halted and there is no alternative power connection even though a dozen USB ports are available nearby. To me this is inexcusable at its original price point.- There is no FN key for quick access to the volume controls in the Function keys only a toggle switch designed for tiny fingers.
3,This keyboard I agree is a fabulous thin LIGHT updated version of the original split keyboard... having used my own original split keyboard and lugging it around from computer to computer for many years until it met its demise with orange juice - I've been mournfully looking for a replacement ever since... but didn't want the bulk (that thing could have been a weapon).So... now typing on the revamped version which I agree... is even more comfortable... and I can even type with long-ish nails - something I would have been hard pressed to do with the deep-set keys of other keyboards (Yes.  My nails would get stuck).The reason this bad-boy got only 3 instead of five stars:The wireless transmitter doohickey stinks.  I plug it into a usb port behind my computer (you know... where the majority of the ports normally are) - keyboard suddenly only works intermittently and the numeric pad works not at all (problematic for me because I actually use it) - not good.The transmitter is supposed to work up to 10 feet away:  I call LIAR!! the length of my desktop case is about hmmmm 2 feet.  My keyboard sits on a keyboard drawer that draws up beside-ish the tower so the transmitter is actually only about 1.5 feet away - and the keyboard won't work all the time and the numeric pad won't work at all.  I have to plug it into the front usb port so the distance is now reduced to about 8 inches - *now* everything works.Also... beware if you are forced to buy this as a bundle... I did it because a.) it was on sale b.) The stores in my area aren't selling the keyboard separately yet.If you're using another mouse (I'm partial to logitech) beware!!! With the initial install of the keyboard... my Logitech mouse was suddenly not recognised and nothing worked.  I hadn't even unwrapped the microsoft mouse - was planning to keep it as backup-mouse-in-the-drawer. The logitech mouse settings were suddenly overridden by this non-existent microsoft mouse and I couldn't double click couldn't override... nothing.Magically after restarting my machine 4 times... I think it might have finally given up... and allowed me to use my regular mouse.I have now hidden the microsoft mouse-thing in a dark corner... devoide of batteries...more than 10 feet away from the desktop...
5,Shape and size: A+ Looks and comfort: A+This is the best keyboard I have used. I do my fastest and most accurate typing with this unit. I paired this (and ditched the odd mouse that came with it) for a vertical wireless Anker unit. I only wish the numeric keypad were part of the main keyboard and not separate only because I do type numbers a lot. (I work at an IT department) Once this unit dies I will get the "Surface" version which is Bluetooth enabled and has the numeric keypad incorporated. However I foresee a long life out of this unit.
4,This is a great keyboard and mouse combo. At first glance the mouse appeared huge but it is very comfortable. The calculator button on the keyboard also come in handy. The only thing I would do to improve the package is the addition of a forward button to the mouse.
4,Works as advertised.  This is not an industrial strength keyboard...so you cannot bang on it all day and expect it to survive.  For casual household use for those that like the split style keyboard it is nice.  The separate numeric keypad allows it to fit in narrower computer desks.
1,This product is well built but poorly designed. The bluetooth receiver dongle is NOT REPLACEABLE. let that sink in. if you paid over $100 for the keyboard mouse and number pad combo but either lost the dongle or in my case accidentally dropped my laptop while the dongle is connected and breaking it this whole beautiful set up will sit gathering dust. I can't buy a replacement dongle from MSFT. I can't replace it with dongle from a used set of the same keyboard/mouse. There's no universal dongles (like Logitech Unifying dongle).the wireless version of this Natural Ergonomic keyboard is thinner than the wired variant so the key strokes aren't as satisfying because this wireless version feels like you're tapping on a laptop keyboard not a stand alone keyboard.mouse quality is great bit too big for me.but come on product managers at MSFT. not having replacement dongles is terrible for the environment and terrible for customers who invests 100$ into this. Not excusable since Logitech had unifying dongle for a while already.
3,In a longer review posted on sevenforums I gave the sculpt keyboard the following marks:Software Install (ease lack of problems): A (Mouse and Keyboard Center installs without issue)Software Features: D (Extremely limited remapping features (four keys really?) a calculator button that calls up a calculator that is embarrassingly poor - I'd rather use a slide rule and of course I can't remap it to my HP-15 emulator)Hardware Ergonomics: B+ (ease of typing the spacebar is hard to reach even with my (huge) hands the numeric keypad does not have the ability to attach and cannot be elevated to match the keyboard's ergonomic angle)Intangibles: F (compared to Logitech offerings the lack of replacement transciever availability and no unifying approach for peripherals are really unacceptable)Good software design hides needless complexity.  Microsoft takes this too far by eliminating useful and needed functions (more key remapping) and hoping we won't notice.  We do.Will I keep this keyboard.  There is a lot to like.  If I can find some software (or if MS added function to the mouse and keyboard center) to allow easier key remapping certainly.  Otherwise I''m going to see how I like it after a few weeks.  Given that MS has abandoned other ergonomic forms and that I like the Logitech unifying transciever (and the availability of spares) I may end up with a complete Logitech setup (I just upgraded to a Logitech Performance MX mouse.)I've used an MS kb and mouse for the past ten years or so. Loved them. Strange to consider changing.
2,First things first. Let's talk about the good stuff (TL;DR at the end)Keyboard: It's ergonomic and it feels great. I was worried that "manta ray" type design combined with a pretty thin profile would make the keyboard feel a little flimsy - not so. The unit itself feels solid and high quality. The keys feel great too. They press easier than my old keyboard (a solar-powered logitech) and again feel like they are high-quality when I'm typing. It's also pleasantly quiet.Mouse: I love the mouse. It was a little hard to get used to coming from a traditional mouse but once I did I found that I preferred the ergonomic hand position. Like the keyboard it felt more natural and less fatiguing on the ol' wrist. Also like the keyboard the mouse felt high-quality and I love the feel of the buttons.So why two stars? As others have mentioned the keyboard and mouse cannot be paired to any other wireless receiver except the one that was included in the box. If you break or lose yours you are simply out of luck. For me I found my reciever slightly bent after a flight. Upon checking my keyboard/mouse Windows gave me an error that my "USB device was not recognized." Conversations with Microsoft have proven fruitless. They simply tell me that I must buy a new combo. My keyboard and mouse are now simply trophies of my own carelessness.Summary / TL;RD:The inability of the keyboard / mouse to sync to a different receiver is a deal breaker for me. If not for this issue this would be my favorite keyboard and mouse period. If you choose to buy this despite my warning make sure you protect that USB receiver with your life!
5,I love the feel and function of this set but unfortunately the USB receiver seems to be going bad after about 18 months of use. I've updated the driver and I've searched the Microsoft forum and other forums for a fix for this but other than haranguing Microsoft customer service for an entire replacement set there is no other recourse. They do not have replacement USB receivers that you can sync with existing keyboards. I think a $125 keyboard set should last longer than 18 months.UPDATE 7/17/17. I upgraded this to a 5 because it came with a 3-year warranty and when I brought it to a Microsoft retail store they gave cheerfully gave me a new one. They actually let me upgrade to the Surface Ergonomic keyboard with no cost. Unfortunately that one didn't pair well with my Dell Latitude so I had to go back to a straight replacement.
2,I got this in Staples for $129 :-(.  Too late to return.  I was woo'd strictly by the mouse.  That's all I wanted I didn't need the keyboard or the numeric keypad.  However the mouse is original daring and well ok it's basically the same mouse as the trackball one with a roundness to it.  But if fit so well I had to have it.  I spend a good portion of my career with keyboard and mice and it pays to have something that works for you.  Question is the mouse worth $90?  I guess I'll have to say yess on this (as you can see the keyboard is accting up againn).  I can't buy the mouse separately so I have no choice.  The mouse is stellar. Update I guess you can buy the mouse separately but if you do then that's one extra usb port you need to use.Updated review having some issues with this unit it's not typing 100% sometimes and I feel like I got royally screwed.  I love the mouse it's the most expensive mouse I've owned because the keyboard and keypad is %#%%.  It sometimes misses letters then goes off like typppppping and thiiisssss and other $#%%  The numeric keypad does not stay on NUM Lock.  I want to just type on there when I have to not having to remember to hit NUM LOCK everytime I use it also no delete button on the numeric keypad it should be right there rather than just on the keyboard.
2,#1: Great keyboard WHEN NEW. Wears out quickly for heavy users. Palm rest discolors. Keys stick easily.#2: I have purchased 3 of these KBs. My pet peeve is if you lose the USB receiver you're screwed (which was the case with my first 2 KBs).  It can't be replaced and therefore the KB becomes trash. Come on Microsoft; don't you make enough $$ off us consumers???#3: This 3rd keyboard after 1.5 years battery life has diminished to 1 day YES 1 DAY!  No keys are sticking KB is cleaned regularly uninstalled & reinstalled software and drivers. After researching online I found this to be a problem with a multitude. Has Microsoft addressed the problem.... NO!DON'T PURCHASE THIS KEYBOARD UNTIL MS CHANGES THEIR WAYS. Crap materials cheap builds non-replaceable USB receivers complete lack of addressing problems when a multitude complains of the same issue.  This KB should be under recall!
5,I love the keyboard and it works great.  curved keyboards are wonderful to use once you get used to them so be prepared. It relieves the shoulder pain from trying to keep your arms straight and center using a standard keyboard..  I am used to this keyboard so I most likely will order the same one if it is still available.
3,I came from the Microsoft ergonomic 7000 KB and Mouse combo to the now new Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop KB and Mouse Combo.  While my feedback would mostly likely be a comparison of the two let me first say that the Microsoft support center is one of the best folks i have talked to in a while.  Happy with their service.About the Keyboard.Its light small but enough to comfortably maneuver your fingers through all the keys.  The  delete Home end pg up pg dwn buttons and the arrow keys will take time to get used to.  Coming from another ergonomic keyboard (the MS 7000 KB and mouse) this new sculpt needs a bit of a learning curve.  Unlike my transition from an ordinary kb to the Ms7000 it is much more intuitive than this one.I have mixed feeling as well with the separate keypad.  Part of my IT work is to key in numbers that are sometimes 8-20 characters long.  Again it will take time to get used to trying to reach for that elusive keypad that seems to crawl away from my desk.The mouse:I would say that the ms wireless laser mouse 7000 is hands down more ergonomic than the sculpt. the 7000 even has a back and forward buttons making it easy for you to navigate through your browser.Verdict:If you can still find the MS Ergonomic 7000 i would recommend that.  if you need a smaller keyboard and does not have dependencies on the number keypad go with the Sculpt.
2,Nothing is better for ergonomics. I'll continue to buy these but save yourself some frustration:I have bought multiple sets of these over the years and the same problems occur. The side mouse button always gets stuck after a while and less frequently the spacebar will depress and not return to the original position.I highly recommend the set for ergonomics but it is absolutely necessary to either buy the third-party warranty so you can replace it easily when it inevitably fails. The Microsoft warranty is supposedly 3 years but you will never be able to successfully submit a claim because you'll be transferred indefinitely through the Microsoft phone tree in India. The Microsoft store can't submit a claim on your behalf either. The other alternative is to purchase it direct but you'll pay more. If you purchase direct or pay Amazon for the third-party warranty then you'll be satisfied.
3,The keyboard is delightful super comfortable and the separate number pad is super handy.But there are significant issues with "ghosting" where holding down even 2 or 3 keys at the same time can cause weird behavior.For example a key combination I use frequently - capslock+alt+s (I re-map control to capslock because it's more ergonomic to move my pinky a little bit than to curl it under my wrist) - simply doesn't register at all.  Another combination that I discovered playing a video game: right-arrow+space+d.Many keyboards have issues with ghosting when subjected to stress testing but this one has a half-dozen combinations I need to consciously work around that I discovered through regular use.  I really hope that Microsoft does another iteration (perhaps with a "gaming" label since that's what it seems to take to get anti-ghosting configurations) that fixes these issues because otherwise the keyboard is just fantastic.
3,The ergonomics and typing feel are really pretty good I think but at least the particular one I have is buggy. It's buggy enough I regularly look for an alternative but haven't found one.I've had it about a year now and a few keys never worked reliably (as in almost never where the "c" in "SELECT" be capitalized with the rest of the word- which as a programmer writing SQL happens a 100 times a day and is really really annoying) the space key increasingly doesn't always fire and the function keys often get stuck in a down position. Recently if I typed certain keys in a certain order ("i" and "o" I think it was) it would start backspace-deleting lines at a time which as you might guess is really really annoying.But if we assume mine is a lemon the only real complaint I have is that there is no gap between the arrow keys and their neighbors. I have developed muscle memory now that helps but as someone who uses the arrow keys in confunction with other keys to quickly navigate and move large chunks of text not having a touch-based reference point (like on a MacBook keyboard) is a shortcoming.So minus 1 star for a probable lemon and minus 1 for no arrow key gap. I would buy another (and in fact suspect I will have to this year because of the increasing bugginess) but only because I don't think there is a better option that combines bluetooth ergonomics and feel.
3,the insert key next to the return was a mistake.
5,I love this keyboard and mouse. I tried it for the first time at my previous job and loved it. The mouse is super awesome and feels amazingly ergonomic. It's like holding a nice tennis ball in your hand! The keyboard is awesome too. Not sure why there's that gap in the middle. Anyway I loved this so much that I ordered it again at my next company. It looks way prettier than the other ergonomic keyboards I've seen out there and definitely feels comfortable. I never have wrist pains anymore when using this set. I'm thinking of getting this for my dad's next birthday present since he still uses a wired mouse and keyboard from like 1990s. Time to upgrade. Also the battery life is pretty good considering they both require batteries since they're wireless. The only con is that the wrist pad area starts to get dirty real quick. Maybe dirty isn't the right word but it gets all white where your wrists are rubbing and the white doesn't come off so they keyboard doesn't stay super black and clean.
5,This is my first day using this keyboard and I already love it. It makes it easier to type and it feels more natural. I learned how to type when I was about 10 years old so I may not have picked up the best typing practices and I have to get used to some of the keys ("B" placement for example). Mouse feels good and so does the keyboard. I just have to get used to the 10 key thats detached.
5,I bought this to replace the MSFT natural keyboard that I'd been using for decades since it was too loud for my wife. It's good. Takes a bit of getting used to but I use it for hours and have no complaints except one: sometimes keys will stop working mysteriously like Shift+C or for a bit Ctrl-LeftArrow weren't working. Turns out this happens because the little keys in the function key row get jammed in the "down" position very subtly which messes up the keyboard's ability to send certain key chords. So if you have something weird happening take a look at the top row keys and make sure they are all loose. Doesn't happen all that often that I would consider it a factor in whether to buy it but it is something you should know if you buy it.
4,only Num Lock is not comfortabnle. other is very good to use. good to use the numner pad after click.i hope next version must make easier to click Num Lock only.
5,I've been using this keyboard and mouse combo for three years at work and it is the finest keyboard I've ever used.  The mouse is also very good.  The ergonomics of both are excellent.  The pairing using the little "bug" (at least that's what I call it it's a small USB insert) is flawless.  Both the keyboard and mouse are incredibly well thought out and durable.  I am a real nut when it comes to key travel (the keyboard is a short-travel keyboard) ergonomics feel and quality.  This keyboard is top of the line.  I've never used better than this.I'm going to buy a set for a new computer at home.  If I love it in the office may as well stick with it at home right?You'll not regret this purchase.
5,Wonderful set.Been using it the past 2 years and still very pleased with it.No problems thus far and typing never felt better.One minor downside is that it has a different layout than regular keyboards so if (like me) you use it at work and use a regular keyboard at home you'll may find out you have more typing mistakes on the regular keyboard. (Prompting you to switch it as well)Also the separation of the unnecessary numpad is great too since I never used it in keyboards anyway so I simply stashed the numpad in a drawer and haven't used it since.
2,Bought this keyboard exactly one year ago on the dot. It has served me fairly well though I have had several instances of it not logging all of the keystrokes leading to me retyping things occasionally but no glaring issues otherwise - that is until recently. It now cuts out (stops responding / logging keystrokes) entirely after about 5 minutes of use. Popping a battery out and back in will revive it for another 5 mins at which time it dies again. No amount of troubleshooting resolves this despite the mouse and numpad continuing to work normally. This of course happened immediately after the warranty expired hinting at planned obsolescence. Or perhaps it's just poor design. Either way the result is a keyboard that is not worth your money. Do yourself a favor and avoid this one. Buy a Logitech instead like I should have done. Lesson learned.
4,Something about it not as comfy as I was hoping but still better than other stuff ive used.
3,Its an OK Keyboard. I'm on my third one. First two failed both within a year of being put into service. Nice keyboard it is really comfortable but not sure it's worth the money. I'm using the wired Microsoft Natural ergonomic keyboard now with if very similar.  Microsoft tells me there will be a new Ergonomic Desktop coming out in Dec or January so I will get one.
2,This set WAS great- but buyer beware. The dongle is large and easy to break yet not programmable and not replaceable. This means that when you break it (like I did when putting my laptop in my backpack) you have to throw away the both keyboards & the mouse. No support available from Microsoft on this my IT team at work told me to toss it and buy a new one.
3,Purchased this as a replacement for my MS Natural desktop (my beloved MS Natural keyboard died last week).  So far I like the keyboard and the mouse.  The battery compartments on the keyboard and mouse - magnetic pretty slick!  Overall what you see is what you get.  I still need to adjust to the new keyboard design/layout but nothing unexepected.  I think that I like the Natural mouse more than I do the Sculpt mouse but that might be a familiarity issue.  Both are nice.Complaints:  User documentation that was packaged with the set is sparse.  The product is basically plug and play so not a big deal except it would be nice to know battery requirements and how to install/replace.  The back of the box indicated that I would need (2) AAs (2) AAAs and (1) 3V 270mAh battery.  3 different battery types to power one desktop?  Inconvenient.  FWIW correct answer on the 3V 270mAh battery is CR2430.  I found this out after 3 failed attempts to unscrew the battery compartment on the keypad and still failing to grok that there was a friction fit and that I needed to pry the back of the case off with the tip of my screwdriver.  Overall length of the screw is barely long enough to catch the threads to close the compartment.  MS needs to put the keypad back on the design board and rethink it a bit.Don't hate it; don't love it.
5,Also see update at bottom of review!This is in my opinion hands down the best looking ergonomic keyboard ever manufactured.  Unfortunately in my opinion that is where the quality ends.The padded material on which you rest your hands is a porous sponge-like material that turns a whitish color with use.  I am guessing that it is simply dead skin cells that get trapped in the pores of the material.  Also the padding under that material is held in place by a plastic frame that borders the padding.  The frame is not easy on the hands and after only six weeks of use I can tell that the padding is going to wear out where it is stretched over the frame.The keyboard shipped with two new Duracell batteries that appear to be manufactured in July 2013 and have a "best if used by" date of March 2019.  I purchased this keyboard set in November 2013 and after five weeks of use I had to change the batteries in the keyboard.I will update my review (and possibly rating) at a later date when I have a better feel for the wear and tear and after I go through a second set of batteries.UPDATE:My concerns about wear and tear and battery life were for naught and I am adjusting my review from two stars to five stars.  I love using this keyboard mouse and numberic key pad.
5,Originally I loved this setup. Best keyboard / mouse combo I've found for my tendonitis issues with carpal tunnel-like symptoms.Using on an iMac.After a while the keys started repeating randomly and I couldn't figure it out. I tried cleaning it checking software settings everything and eventually gave up.Recently I did some searching and found that the F keys have a tendency to stick a bit which makes the other keys repeat. I hope other people find this solution as well.Now that I've figured that out I would say that this is my favorite keyboard ever. Sure there are limitations - esc key is easy to miss blindly as are some of the other smaller chicklet type keys but overall the comfort makes up for the limitations.I'm going to buy one for my home office now after using the same setup at work for over a year now. Batteries last a long time wireless has no issues rugged construction.
3,+ comfortable + nice key action + Mouse is comfortable - plows thru batteries - number pad is a 3rd piece should be attached - no cap lock indicator
5,I've been having some pain from poor posture and typing for a while so when this new ergonomic keyboard came available I jumped on it. After a couple weeks I'm very glad I did.Pros:- Great design - it looks sleek and more importantly both the keyboard and mouse are very comfortable even in all day use. I'm quite happy with the keyboard layout and movement of keys and the mouse fits my average sized hand just right.- Setup was easy - plug it in take out the battery covers and you're good to go.- Really cool - the battery cover on the mouse is magnetic so no breaking clips or worrying about losing parts. It snaps right into place easily.- It does take some getting used to the typing mostly because I don't "correctly" touch type. I'm working on breaking the old habits but importantly it helps force me into good posture with my wrists and fingers alleviating some of the former pain.Cons:- The dongle is a bit big. I've got other peripherals that have the tiny mini dongle and I'm not sure why Microsoft couldn't provide one of those here.- No idea why the mouse has a Windows key - that's one of the most unused keys on my keyboard. The back key works great though.
2,I bought this keyboard about a year ago. At first it seemed like it would be a great option - the mouse is a comfortable and the shape of the keyboard is comfortable. The problem is that the wireless connection is really spotty. There is very little that one can do about that - you can try and put the wireless dongle in different places but that's it and it makes no difference. Some days it will work decently but other days the mouse jumps all over the screen and the keyboard will skip typed letters frequently. Sometimes I'd press a key 10+ times before it registered on the screen.If only there was a way to directly connect the keyboard to the computer...
2,I loved this keyboard/keypad/mouse set. But suddenly today my keyboard stopped working. I replaced the batteries and it worked for a second but then stopped again. Basically I can get it to type about one word at a time before I have to pull the batteries out and put them back in to get it to type the next word. No problems with the keypad or mouse. I had hoped they keyboard could be fixed but the IT person at my office wasn't able to fix it and based on reviews I'm now reading here it looks like calling Microsoft tech support would be a frustrating & futile effort. :-(
3,The keyboard is a successor to the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000.  As a successor it's quite good.  I like the feel and the ease of typing.  It's even less effortless to type than the Ergonomic 4000.  But this keyboard could be much better.  My gripe is that the rightmost keys (including arrow keys delete insert page up down) are too close to the main keys.  They are not easy to identify by touch if you always touch-type and never look at the keyboard.  I'd prefer them to be a little different and a little more detached from the main keys to assist with touch typing.  Also as you might notice the right Ctrl key is located closer to the center than usual and the right arrow key takes the place where you'd expect the Ctrl key to be.  That leads to frequent mistakes.  I'm surprised the keyboard designers chose to change the layout with regard to right Ctrl and arrow keys because any changes and unregularities usually lead typing mistakes for people who are used to a certain layout very common to all keyboards.  My ideal is the Microsoft Natural Elite Keyboard sans the numeric keypad.  This is what I'd like the keys layout to be.The mouse is a mixed bag but you can get used to it over time.  It has that stupid "Windows" key that I never use because it's located in such an inconvenient place.  I'd say the mouse is just OK.
5,Very smooth and simple from picture instructions to use of individual pieces.Once I located the picture "instructions" everything was very simple.The device practically installed itself onto my computer with little help from me except putting the little USB plug into the side of my laptop.The shape of the key board does take a little getting used to but it is amazing how easily my hands adapt to typing on it.  The magnet strip attached under the keyboard was very helpful in enabling me to achieve the desired wrist angle.While I am still trying to adjust to the mouse my husband (Patrick) gave it a test drive and exclaimed "this is awesome!"  Since he is the computer nerd in our family I think that is a BIG compliment to the full & rounded design of the mouse.  Patrick calls it the Mouse of Mice.I have not had the opportunity to use the separate number pad but what a great idea.Overall though this is our first day using the ergonomic desktop we were both very impressed.  As my husband said "Great job Microsoft!"
2,I've had this keyboard/mouse combo for almost a year now. Over the past four months the mouse has starting having intermittent connection problems. At first I thought it was me so I tried new batteries changing the location of the USB dongle different computer.. you get the idea. None of this helped. Now the keyboard is starting to do the same thing.It is sad because I do love the setup and ease of use but not if it is only going to last one year. I paid nearly $90 - it should last much longer.I've contacted Microsoft for a replacement under the warranty. They were agreeable but I have to pay shipping to send the defective items and I have to send them before they send the replacement. NOT a good solution. Your product is malfunctioning. You should fix it without extra costs or time on my part. I'm suppose to go without a keyboard/mouse for 3 weeks? Unlikely. But I'm also not going to be out $90 so I'm doing the warranty fix. I'm very disappointed.
1,To be honest the keyboard is very good so is the mouse. Ergonomic and not ergomaniac. Solved my back pain problem. My problem is with the product design. that is prone to failure. I have three sets. Two of them have already needed replacements for the left and/or right buttons on the mouse and here is why I rated them low:1. The mouse buttons that you push are tactile switches commonly found as control buttons on your LCD monitors. They are only intended for occasional pushes not repeated pushes like a left mouse key. All other mice I've used and repaired (we like to keep good mice) have micro switches for buttons and they last for a number of years let's say 3-5 years. The two broken MS sculpt mice broke within 1-3 years. Considering their price at $100 per set they should last longer so 1-3 yr is unacceptable. Replacing the keys also took a lot of skills compared with a regular mouse say from Logitech. The part is surface mount and hard to find replacements and hard to get off the circuit board.2. Once you lose your dongle the whole set is good as junk. You can't pair a new dongle with your existing desktop like you can with Logitech. You broke your mouse you get a new mouse that comes with its own dongle. Very soon your laptop runs out of USB port for all different dongles.3. No left-handed version. Lefty can't use it. Sorry.I thought I found the ultimate desktop set but that falls apart after a couple of years of use. I'll still get another set at deep discount and keep looking for better-quality ones.
3,My biggest gripe is that the memory foam palm rest is already discolored and beginning to show signs of perishing/degradation. I noticed today that the foam on the left hand side seems to have stretched or come unglued and the surface is loose and wavy. I've used the keyboard for about 150 hours in the 3 months that I've owned it. It took me about a month to get used to the ball-shaped mouse now I find quite natural. I'm still not used to reaching across my desk for the number pad but then I don't use it much. Other than that it's a great layout for typing really fast without fatigue.The rubber on MS keyboards and mice seem to be their Achilles heel. My previous keyboard was the MS Comfort 5000 and it lasted about 2 years. First the rubber on the mouse scroll wheel perished but some carefully applied band-aid tape worked fine for several months. The rubber wrist pad became very sticky and I had to cover it with duct tape.  Finally the keys began sticking so much that I had to replace the whole unit. It seems like Microsoft fails to test the materials that go into their keyboards properly.
3,Just a note in case anybody is interested. I did a quick test on one of these and the actuation force for the keys is approximately 55 g. That is not too high and not too low. A couple of others like the kinesis freestyle the gold touch keyboards and anything with a cherry MX brown mechanical key is around 40-45 g. That is about as low as you're going to get. The Apple MacBook keyboards seem to be around 65 g or so. I conducted all of these tests using stacks of nickels. Apparently a nickel is specified to be approximately 5g by the US mint.HTH.
1,Good keyboard and mouse except that when my mouse wore out (too quickly IMO) I bought a replacement mouse.  You can't pair a mouse/keybord with an existing dongle.  You need to trash the whole thing and start over if 1 piece breaks.You'll need to take up 2 USB ports and these are longer than the Logitech dongles so they are easier to break.Really bad design on an otherwise good product.  Save your money and go to another company
3,This review was written based on use with Mac OS 10.7.5Given that this keyboard was designed by Microsoft I obviously had low expectations about how well it would work with a Mac but I'm still surprised how poor it is.I'll start with the good and work my way down to the bad.The Good: The mouse.Despite being the size of a baseball I've found the mouse to be very responsive and comfortable. For Mac users the right and left buttons work as well as the scroll wheel including the side-to-side scrolling. The back button and windows button do nothing and there is no way to assign functionality to them.The ok: The keyboard.I like the tactile feel of the keys a lot. If you've never used an ergonomic keyboard it does take a bit to get used to -- I especially find hitting the comma and period buttons to be awkward -- but I think you can begin to adjust to it rather quickly.For mac user's there's limited functional with the top row function keys. Play/pause and volume +/- work; print screen and scroll lock adjust the brightness. And that it's. None of the other Mac shortcuts work like pressing F3 to go to Mission Control.The bad: the keypad.I love the idea of a separate keypad especially to bring with me on work trips (so leave the keyboard behind); unfortunately I cannot get it work with my Mac.Final thoughts: given the lack of functionality for Macs I cannot recommend this set for Mac users. However I really like the mouse and would recommend that on its own (  and it is sold standalone        ).
2,The two mosquito-bite-itch design flaws on this product are as follows :1. The Delete key is beside the Enter Key.2. The Insert key is just above the Up Arrow Key.SeriouslyMicrosoft what happened to "Eat your own dog food". Are you honestly saying to us "Yeahwe trialled this keyboard with our software engineers internally and THEY LOVED IT!" They love hitting the Delete key when they want the Enter key and its really adds to their day when they want to move up a line but toggle Overwrite mode!Lesser but notable faults are:1. The arrow keys are not separated from the rest of the keys (but at least the right arrow key is the bottom right most key)2. The Esc key is a button and not a full key which is annoying but it is a least in the correct position.3. The Function keys are not sufficiently grouped a long running fault in this range but still worthy of mention. F6 and F7 are locatable because of the split gap which is better than nothing.Poor non-alphanumeric key placement means that a lot of these keys have to be found by looking at the keyboard and that's its main flaw.And finally Microsoft refuse to split the keyboard fully in two which would be the most courageous thing to do that would assist us greatly towards achieving the most natural un-ulnar-deviated hand position. Give that numeric key pad is successfully split off it's a pity that they didn't go the whole hog to split the keyboard proper.For casual use where your hands are home located this is an ok keyboard.For coders it's sadly annoying.Moving on to the mouseThe Mouse is not very ergonomic.It straddles the space between a vertical mouse and a supportive non-vertical mouse. Although chunky and beefy which is a step in the right direction it's less than half the width of my hand and does not support a natural hand spread. The hand rotation that brings you towards the vertical mouse handshake territory is only partial and would probably be better if the hand position could rotate by around 40+ degrees closer to a handshake. The one-size-fits-all is the main clue as to the lack of ergonomic credentials here.
3,The keyboard works great - the keypad is a piece of junk!  As an accountant I use the keypad more than the keyboard.  The numbers 14and 7 will cut out randomly.  I've changed the battery several times and it keeps recurring.  Microsoft told me to buy another set - they wouldn't stand by their product.
2,This keyboard is incredibly frustrating because it is Bluetooth and it misses keys and repeats others. If that isn't an issue then it's perfect.The pros:Very good keypress feelingVery well build and sturdy I like using the elevated restThe panels are held on by magnets so there are no little pieces of plastic that you have to bend back to open up the battery case caseThe cons:No back light. I am a programmer and it is hard to find the odd characters in dim lighting.BLUETOOTHHere is what keeps happening. It will miss my first character that I type pretty regularly. That doesn't sound so bad but when you are copy pasting something it will just wipe out everything with a 'c' left over just to taunt you.Also your last key may just keep repeating. Want to delete a single character in that block of code? NOPE burn it all.Now I am sure you are thinking that it must be my setup. My keyboard is on a keyboard tray my computer is on the desk behind the monitors. It can not read the bluetooth reader over the 2 foot distance through the desk. I then ran an usb extension cable so that the reader is now about a foot from the keyboard with near perfect line-of-sight. The bluetooth antenna is actually attached to the keyboard slider. I am also not using other bluetooth devices right now and it just tried to delete all my code. What was so bad about having wires?I still use this keyboard because it is comfortable but i do shop keyboards almost every other day out of frustration.
3,I've been using Microsoft ergonomic keyboards for about 14 years so ... I wanted to upgrade from Natural Ergonomic 4000 (which is great but got weared out :). So I jumped in and started to use Sculpt about 2 weeks ago. It felt good and modern with a good touch. But then I started to miss "normal" layout of Delete Home End etc keys. The thing is on this new keyboard their on the right side and are too close to each other. But the main problem is when you need to push one of those keys the hand fall off the pad (the ergonomic base). And basically I miss those keys all the time.I'm buying the new Natural Ergonomic 4000 now :) I wish Microsoft produced the new Nat Ergo with the Sculpt touch!
5,This keyboard is wildly comfortable for typing. Everything about it from the key bounce to the satisfyingly subtle click makes me want to go and type with it some more. I have used it for more than a year virtually every day and not yet had to replace the batteries. There are two nuisances: no led of any kind & replacing the right-hand Windows key with a "right mouse click" key. The latter is a problem common to all Microsoft ergonomic keyboards - I have never ever wanted to trigger a right mouse click from the keyboard but I sure miss "Win+L" - but of the former? I can only assume the phenomenal battery life comes at this expense.In summary it is annoying not to have caps lock indicator but not so annoying that I'd dock this fine keyboard even a half a star. After all I don't use a keyboard to look at pretty lights... I use it to type!
3,I have this keyboard for a couple of years. It has one issue that keeps me looking for a replacement. When not typing for 10 secs or so I have to hit the first keystroke twice. Its an annoyance when filling out forms or typing a report whenever you pause but it really is an issue when playing games. You never know when you will have to strike the key twice. It surely not ideal for gaming.  Otherwise it is hard to fault a top end Microsoft keyboard in terms of comfort and key response. And I strongly prefer a separate keypadI understand the size is at a premium but it would have been nice to be able to have next or previous song for multimedia  It has pause volume + - the choice of some of the second options for function key seem arbitrary.
2,Ergonomic wise it is a great step to ditch the numpad making the keyboard smaller and moving the mouse closer.The mouse is bad lacking a second thumb button.The biggest issue is the input lag and the inability to press 3 buttons at once - which gamers need to do repeatedly. Muscle memory from previous Natural Keyboard does not work - inputs don't get registered when multiple keys are pressed. It's nice for writing text terrible as a game input device.
5,I work on a computer all day doing engineering design CAD and lots of fast mouse movements and clicking. I'm only 29 but after a couple years of this I was starting to notice a serious pain and numbness in my fingers and wrists and my previously-nimble fingers seemed that they were getting slower and slower to respond. Uh oh.I started looking around for ergo keyboards and mice and tried out a number of split keyboards and upright mice. I ended up going with the Microsoft Sculpt because both were included together and the keyboard felt great to type on in the store.PROS: I am being completely honest when I say that this keyboard and mouse have saved my wrists and hands. After using this setup for about a month I noticed considerably less pain in my hands and wrists and the agility and sensation were returning to my fingers. 3 months in now my hands and wrists feel GREAT. This alone makes this setup worth 5 stars to me.The keyboard is very very comfortable for me to type on. I'm sure this may vary from person to person depending on how large your hands are but for me it is absolutely ideal. The keyboard slopes downward rather than upward like traditional keyboards and I am left wondering why someone didn't think of this a long time ago. When you place yours hands on this keyboard the resting position feels completely natural--it's the way your arms and hands would rest if you just arbitrarily set them down on a desk in a relaxed position. Getting used to the split keyboard is a little weird at first if you've never used one but after about 2 weeks it felt completely natural to me and now typing on normal keyboards feels very cramped by comparison.The feel of typing on the keyboard is quite nice. I'm more of a clicky mechanical keyboard purist but the island-style keys of this keyboard have a nice amount of travel and a gentle but positive snappiness when typing that doesn't impede typing speed at all. I can't stand Apple keyboards with this style of keys because I feel their travel is too short and they don't stand far enough away from the keyboard but I have no issues at all with the Sculpt keyboard.It seems a lot of people here complain about the mouse but I love it. It is large yes--but it's that way on purpose. I'm a man so I have larger hands and 90% of the mice that every company out there makes are too small for a grown man's hands. When a mouse is too small (particularly in width) it causes your hand to crunch and curl around the mouse to hold it which contributes hugely to carpal tunnel issues. If you find yourself squeezing your mouse between your pinky finger and thumb to move it around and your hand is curling around it too it means it's too small. The sculpt mouse is more like holding a softball--your hand just rests naturally around it and it doesn't feel like you're doing any excessive squeezing or gripping to hang onto it. The buttons curve gently right beneath your fingers so clicking becomes a relaxed motion of slightly increasing the pressure down the length of your finger rather than using the just the tip of your finger.The other great thing about the mouse is that it is more of a vertical (handshake) grip than traditional mice which face your palm down directly toward your desk. With your palm down the two bones in your forearm are twisted and carpal tunnel pressure is increased. With the hand more upright/vertical it relieves a lot of this unhealthy pressure. Just like the split keyboard the mouse does feel a little bit awkward at first compared to traditional mice but that's just because your muscle memory needs some time to adjust. After a week or two it will feel very natural.Also I really like the detached wireless number pad. It has a calculator button that launches the Windows calculator and a backspace key built into it so in use it almost feels like an independent calculator pad rather than a number pad. This is nice if you use the number pad a lot for quick calculations or data entry.CONS: The keyboard is wireless via USB rather than Bluetooth so you'll give up a USB port to use the keyboard and mouse. Also as others mentioned the USB dongle sticks out about 1/2" from the USB port unlike the slim USB receivers used by Logitech. If you're carrying the mouse around with you and using it with a laptop you'll have to take the USB receiver out every time you put your laptop away. Also the USB receiver appears to be hard-coded to both the mouse and keyboard so if it dies the keyboard and mouse are both useless. I wish Microsoft would have thought that through a bit better.The function keys (F1 - F10) are very small and can be hard to find for touch-typists. Also the delete/home/end/pgup/pgdn cluster are in a strange layout to the right of the keyboard so if you use those a lot in a traditional 7-row setup expect some pains adjusting to that.Finally I'm not sure how the long-term reliability of this keyboard will play out. The first one I owned worked great for a month but then the mouse developed a very weird issue where it would drop its connection to the wireless receiver after about 10 seconds of inactivity. It could not be used again until it was powered off and on again and any time you stopped moving it for a few seconds it quit working again. I tried everything to troubleshoot the issue including new batteries and testing it with a completely different computer and the problem remained. It appeared to be some sort of hardware fault with the mouse itself.I called Microsoft's product replacement hotline about the problem and much to my amazement they immediately offered to replace the whole setup no questions asked. I simply told them that the mouse had stopped working I had tested it with different computers I was convinced it was a hardware fault and I wanted it to be replaced. The CSR took down my info sent me a brand new keyboard mouse and number pad and told me I could keep the old one (the old keyboard and number pad still worked fine just not the mouse). The replacement arrived in just a couple days.So far the new one has been working great for a few months so maybe it was just a fluke. I would remove one star for this but because my experience with Microsoft's customer service was (shockingly) excellent and because this keyboard and mouse have likely saved me from a lifetime of carpal tunnel issues I'm still sticking with the 5 star rating.
3,I love the feel of the keyboard and the way the mouse fits in my hand. It's also great to have a separate number pad. Unfortunately there is no off switch for the keyboard or number pad so I'm constantly burning through batteries. I bought this to go with my Surface Pro3 but I can't carry it with me without removing the batteries on the keyboard and number pad. It's pretty easy on the keyboard but the number pad battery cover is held closed with a small plastic screw that is a pain to unscrew. This is fine for using at your desk at home but don't plan to use it for travel even though it's a nice small size. If it had an off switch for the keyboard and number pad and was Bluetooth it would be a perfect set.
5,Based on the reviews and blog posts I've read I was kind of iffy on this. I mainly wanted it because I could reclaim that space the num pad wasted on my mousing side. So I went to my local Fry's and picked this up expecting that I might return it. But wow I really love this keyboard. I even replaced my Logitech Performance MX after getting adjusted to the mouse. Microsoft did a really great job on this keyboard/mouse combination. My old Natural 4000 feels like a stonage tool by comparison.As a VI user I use the Esc key very heavily and was really hesitant because of the way people were describing the escape + function keys. But they actually feel really good and are not sticking for me. It's not awkward or cheap feeling.I also use this for my MacBook Air and it's leagues better than the Apple wireless keyboard. Just use the keyboard setting to swap Option (Alt) and Command (Windows) keys and it feels as natural as can be.
2,I bought one of these from Staples about 4 or so months ago. I've always preferred the split keyboard and I needed a new keyboard so I decided to give this over priced Microsoft set a try.  I think I paid 99.00 or 109.00 or there about.I loved the ease of the keys. Travel on them is quite low so it's not necessary to press hard to get them to make the needed contact.  However the layout of the keyboard is squished together and I am still trying to miss the left arrow key when using the right side ctrl key. I still have to look at the keyboard or feel for the size of the delete keys to find the home end pgup pgdn and insert keys.  This is not an intuitive layout.  I have very small hands and this is not a comfortable fit for me. It's too scrunched together at the outside.The mouse is disaster.  It's too big it's too uncomfortable that sideways thing just isn't happening so I end up using the mouse with it pretty much turned sideways.  It eats batteries faster than any wireless mouse I've ever used and now I'm having problems with the left-click not working reliably on it. I have to admit that the ability to program various functions with the mouse is a plus.I love split keyboards but I won't be buying another like this and I wouldn't recommend this one to anyone.
5,Great keyboard okay mouse.I started typing on an old MS Natural (Win 95) that tilted the palm rest up like this unlike all the keyboards since that tilt the back up. The palm rest tilted up is the best position for comfortable all day typing.The keys are great. They are just like a laptops keys except better. No double typing great key press feed back.And it looks great. I'd love a wired version with back lit keys for my gaming setup.The mouse is a little large but the kit was only $10 more with the mouse. It slides across my desk smoothly (be careful for which way you have the battery door on) and has spot on response. The thumb back button is a tiny bit hard to hit easily but usable. This mouse is not for small hands as your fingers must reach all the way forward to click the left and right buttons.Detached num pad awesome! I love keeping my mouse closer to my keyboard.The USB receiver stores in the mouse. The battery doors and keyboard stand attach magnetically very slick.
5,I LOVE this keyboard. Digital marketing takes a toll on your fingers and this keyboard has changed my life! Best investment ever. Been using for about a year now and it is still going strong.No more pain!No more stiff fingers!No more spasming nerves!
2,I've used this keyboard at work for several months. Occasionally (a few times a week) the wireless connection between the keyboard and the receiver will fail and no keystrokes will go through or worse random keystrokes will get dropped resulting in typos. I've had the keyboard replaced by IT 2 times and I've experienced the same issue with all 3 keyboards. This issue very frustrating and I'm looking at getting a different keyboard model. Other than this fatal flaw I really like the ergonomics of this keyboard.
5,10/1/16 UPDATE: The usb dongle that connected the keyboard to my laptop was large and got bumped and broke.  Microsoft does not sell a replacement USB dongle.  Which means your $100 keyboard that works fine but has a broken USB is now garbage.I absolutely love this combo set.  The keyboard is by far the best i've ever used.  I had the wave before and liked that but this feels so much better and is so much quieter and more pleasing to the touch.  I also love the mouse and feel like it's also the best i've ever used.  Great job Microsoft.  Yes this is a legit review and not a Microsoft employee/vendor.
2,Don't waste your money. Once the dongle goes bad the keyboard and mouse is useless. Microsoft doesn't have a replacement dongle. It took 1.5 hours for a tech support associate to let me know that. Total waste!
2,Two stars because I like the form and typing feels decent.  Travel is a tiny bit longer than I'd like though.I purchased this hoping to pair it to my surface pro. It will NOT pair without the cheap bluetooth receiver it comes with. Additionally if you lose the receiver you cannot simply purchase another one. You must purchase a new keyboard and mouse.
1,Basically if you misplace the tiny little wireless dongle the entire keyboard is useless. Microsoft will NOT help you replace it. This is a stupid design. I get that they want "security" but literally having no way to replace something as easily loseable as this tiny dongle is ridiculous.
2,I bought this keyboard several  months ago.  It's comfortable to work on and I got used to the split keyboard fairly quickly BUT...the key strokes lag and it often skips letters or just stalls out. I have tried it on 2 different computers same problem. I have tried using the USB ports in both the front and the back of the computers no difference. I have tried replacing the batteries it made no difference.  So< i am looking for a new wireless ergonomic keyboard.  The dongle is almost impossible to unplug from the USB port.  Disappointed.
1,We lost the dongle. 30 minutes on Microsoft Customer Support only to find out that their warranty/replacement plan does not cover lost USB dongles.  Keyboard was uniquely paired to the dongle with no chance of replacement. Cannot recommend based on that. 80 bucks in the trash can.
5,It's insane how much better this keyboard is than competitors. The only gripe I can come up with is I wish they had independent function keys and/or a function button instead of just a toggle.
1,Purchased brand new in sealed box from Office Depot Jan 12 2019. I hate it. Total junk. The keys either fail to register the keystroke or overcompensate and when hitting any random letter suddenly you have a whole line of jibberish. To add insult to the injury of my wallet comes the following: within days the number pad stopped working (a fresh battery did nothing)....I reset the keyboard speed and sensitivity numerous times only to end up screaming at the monitor as once again the keyboard spazzed out and would not work properly. I went back to an old back up keyboard that's ancient but the only problem after decades is the letter "c" and "d" occasionally stick.  I would give this a zero as even one star is more than this plastic abomination deserves.
2,The keyboard is reasonably comfortable to type with and the break-out numpad is convenient. However as a programmer I found some of the keys I need most often  (e.g. ESC Function keys) are too small and a bit awkward to hit. The mouse is a bit heavy and bulky and a light tap sends it sliding across my desk like a curling rock.The build quality is questionable. The dongle in the first one burned out after a week and the left mouse button on the replacement unit was outright broken.Despite what other reviews have said I purchased this for use with a macbook at the office. If you're planning to use this with a MacBook DON'T! There are no drivers or support available and so your results are likely to be spotty at best and it won't work at all at worst.
1,This device is horrible. I have had it for about six weeks and I can’t reliably  type on it at all. I thought at first it was just the batteries so I kept changing them out but it is so hit or miss as to when it functions well and when it doesn’t. In fact I couldn’t even type on it to write this review; I had to use my phone! It is functionally useless and I highly recommend you buy another keyboard as this is a piece of crap.
5,Love this keyboard.  It has to be one of the most comfortable keyboard/mouse combos I have purchased in years.the layout angles and button resistance on the keyboard is great.  The buttons are big enough to easily type with and like the fact the space bar is split between the sides.The mouse is really comfortable. about the diameter of a baseball. the blue windows icon is actually a "start" button for windows.  kinda annoying if you are a heavy mouse user sometimes hit it on accident. The rest of it works great and is comfortable in the hand.Battery life is good.  I wish it was bluetooth rather than RF don't care much for the dongle but no connectivity issues between the device and the PC.
1,The ergonomic fit is PERFECT but like the rest of Microsoft's software its too broken to actually use.  Biggest issue is it goes to sleep and never wakes up again.  There is no button or switch to activate it it is supposed to magicly happen and doesn't.  You have to completely disconnect it and repeat the setup process every time.  It is a known bug for which Microsoft's only solution is to try rebooting and manually re-installing drivers over and over.  Also the function keys come and go and the number keypad worked once and never again.

5,This is my first ergonomic keyboard so I wasn't completely sure what to expect. My work involves a lot of fine-motor work though so I figured it was a good idea to give it a try.Setup was incredibly simple. the devices come with the batteries already inserted. All you need to do is remove the little plastic tab keeping the batteries from contacting the terminals. The battery case lids are held closed by very light magnets. If you have concerns like carpal tunnel you don't have to worry about the pinching or twisting so many devices require. The USB receiver is stored inside the mouse. I just plugged it in and it set everything up for me automatically.Again it's my first ergonomic keyboard so it's taking a bit of adjustment on my part since keys are in a slightly different position than my muscle memory would suggest but it hasn't been that bad. I certainly love the look too. It's very sleek and modern-looking almost to the moint of sci-fi. Keyboards of this type I hve seen in teh past were very clunky and awkward looking.
5,I received this set as a gift and have so far only great things to say about it.It looks amazing with the striking gap between the two sides of the keyboard.The keys click softly; it is more quiet that the two Logitech keyboards I own.The additional 'lift' piece that comes with the keyboard makes it even more comfortable giving your hands a downward alignment more natural than regular keyboards that point upwards.The function keys and escape key are a bit on the small side. You can choose their functionality (plain F keys or shortcuts) using a switch on the keyboard.On-screen queues for things like sound volume and caps lock are a bit too small especially if you used Logitech's software before.The mouse is fantastic. Comfortable form fitting in the palm of your hand and offering tilt wheel (left/right scroll) along with regular scrolling.The keypad works but is more of an optional add-on. Still serves the purpose if you need it.In all a really really good keyboard from Microsoft.
5,I moved from a Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 to this and absolutely love the look design and feel. This thing is amazing the only downside is the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 had more function keys that I would assign for stuff. I have been developing software for 12 years now and this keyboard is a pleasure to use. I use it for more then 8+ hours a day and my hands and wrists are rarely fatigued at the end of the day. The batteries last for about a month but with as much as I use it it makes sense. Really great buy.
1,This keyboard shape is nice but that is where it ends. I have 2 of these 1 at home 1 at work. I put about 12 to 15 hrs of work on these and I have had enough. As I type randomly the keys fail to respond. I press the keys and nothing happens on the screen it hangs and lags. Mouse lags as well randomly. I have just right now walked over and dumped these in the trash. I am now using logitech keyboard and mouse and its 100% perfect! DO NOT BUY THESE
3,I've taken time to review this because I wanted to give it a thorough workout and I definitely did. So what did I discover:MOUSE:I'm a portrait photographer and was excited by the idea that the mouse could help my hand to feel better. Um no. The mouse was far too large to actually work well with my little hands and I could not maneuver with it at all. I do NOT use the mouse currently and have no plans to.KEYBOARD:Now the keyboard I'm in love with. It is ergonomic so it does take a bit of time to get used to but since I do a lot of my work sitting on the couch (editing can get boring - it's nice to have noise LOL) I was worried that the keyboard would not fit well in my lap. It actually fits behind well! It's comfortable and light and is very easy and comfortable to use. The sync process only took a few moments and the keyboard was ready to go! The ONLY con I have about the keyboard is that there is no "off" button and that the batteries aren't rechargeable.Overall I think this would be a great set for someone who does a lot of desk work. Graphic designers or photographers should snag the keyboard but completely avoid the mouse at all costs!
5,I spend a lot of time on my computer and the work-issued Lenovo keyboard was driving me nuts; it was low-profile but they key action was terrible and required a very heavy touch. I decided to pay for this out of pocket when it was full price--over $120--and it was worth every cent. It took a couple hours of getting used to and I learned that I had been typing my y's with the wrong finger--but since then it's been an absolute dream.The key action is fantastic; only a very light stroke is needed as compared to other low-profile keyboards. I didn't think I would care for the mouse as much as the keyboard but I've really come to like the bulbous shape. I am very comfortable using this set all day long at work and I have recently become the envy of some of my workmates. I would highly recommend this set to anyone who is waffling. If your concern is the price stop hesitating and buy.
1,I have this keyboard for a year it doesn't work well since day one. I brought that into Microsoft store they said no problem is my computer. My computer works well with all other keyboards.The problem is missing the key entry so frustrated when you type in a password to the site always fail.Most of the times it doesn't respond. You have to hit it so many times to get a response.No support tried to update the driver seems doesn't make any difference.Now it is just another junk sitting in my garage.The numeric keypad is working good never miss any typing the mouse is good and it responds well. Only the keyboard is bad.
2,There are many lengthy reviews here that cover the product in detail so I won't go over everything. However I will list the major pros and cons for me...Pros: Looks great and is ergonomic. This is my first proper wireless keyboard and mouse combo... it's fun. Being able to move the numpad around is helpful around as well. Having magnetic battery covers and keyboard riser is entertaining and a nice touch.Cons: There seems to be inconsistent build quality with this product. A co-worker also bought the keyboard. His tends to wobble and make noise every time you put your hands down on it. The keyboard wasn't quite shaped properly or the feet were misaligned. He is returning his keyboard. On the other hand my keyboard isn't defective but the Windows button on the mouse (as pointless as it may be) doesn't work 3 out of 4 times if you try to push it. I think a glossy mouse was a bad choice. I also don't like the feel of the function keys -- they are too shallow and hard to push. The palm rest seems to have a hard edge that hits the corner of my wrist and makes me relatively uncomfortable.Update after a month of use: It is worth noting that the texture on the keys is already starting to wear off and look glossy primarily on the spacebar. That was quick.UPDATE: After over a year of ownership with 40 hours use per week I've had to replace neither the keyboard nor the keypad batteries. The mouse lasted just under a year on the provided batteries. Overall I love using the keyboard but the mouse is a disappointment. The rubbery material on the mouse has basically worn off where my thumb rests and the rest is bubbling up and generally looks disgusting. Since the keyboard/mouse has a 2 or 3 year warranty I plan on seeing if they'll do something about the mouseUPDATE #2: Keys on the keyboard started to fail between 2 to 2.5 years of use at the office. Cheaper keyboards and mice seem to outperform this one over time! I may have been able to use the warranty but neglected to do so. Oh well.
1,Nice ergo design for keyboard and mouse. Very comfortable keystroke and responsive mouse. However the USB transceiver is larger than most mouse USB dongles and susceptible to damage. I barely bumped it the other day and even though it looks fine it stopped working. (It's less than 9 mos old.) Microsoft will not support it and I quote from a support email they sent after I talked to someone on the phone: "Note: Transceivers that came with Microsoft Keyboards and Mice are not replaceable nor for sale." This is not even my first time calling support. It spontaneously stopped working a few months ago but they fixed it remotely -- apparently it was a software issue.  I have selected a Logitech ergo keyboard rather than lose my $130 investment once again.
3,I have used a Microsoft Natural Keyboard 4000 every day for the last 6 years and was looking for a replacement as my old keyboard is worn out.This keyboard layout will feel comfortable and familiar to anyone who is used to the 4000 and the feel of the scissor switches is great (and quiet).I also love the fact that they separated the number pad and moved the arrow keys in nice and tight.However I returned this keyboard for two reasons:1. As far as I can tell the left space bar CANNOT be independently remapped from the the right space bar.  On the regular MS Sculpt keyboard the left space bar can be turned into backspace -- a feature I was looking for2. If you plan to remap the CAPSLOCK key be aware that typing CAPSLOCK-w or CAPSLOCK-e will result in an endless stream of control characters.  Note that this happens even if you remap CAPSLOCK to another key (control in my case) and I verified this behavior with both Windows and Linux -- it seems to be a built in feature (bug?) of this keyboard.
1,The keyboard takes a while to get used to because of where the navigational arrows are and page up and down but after 6 months or so you get used to it - sort of.  I like the feel of the keys.  BUT the number pad stops working.  I read that in someone else's review too.  I can push a number 20 times and it will not register.  I can push "enter" and it won't do it.  I've only had it for one year.
2,This was a great keyboard mouse and number pad set! The ergonomic design is wonderful for continuous use. However there is only one transceiver that controls all three. If you lose or damage or have a malfunction with the transceiver or any of the other devices there is no other option than replacement of the entire set.
1,I have gone through 3 of these keyboards over the past 2 or 3 years. The ergonomics of this make it my favorite keyboard ever and I have tried almost everything ever made. The USB connection and usability make it the worst keyboard in history. Every single one of my keyboards has developed extensive lag and missed keystrokes. This has occurred on Windows 7 and 10. I'm an IT administrator I've literally tried everything conceivable. Here's the only fix and it's usually only temporary a usb extension cable it must be plugged into a USB 2.X slot and the dongle has to be within 6 inches of the keyboard at the furthest. Please just give me a wired version. Microsoft made what should be the best ergonomic keyboard on earth and ruined it with a garbage proprietary wireless connection method. This like a Pontiac Fiero with a Lamborghini body kit. What on earth are you thinking.
1,If you lose it throw away the keyboard. Microsoft won't replace it. And there is no universal replacement receiver.
1,The USB wireless adapter sticks out of your computer at least 1/2" which is VERY prone to bending/breaking on a laptop that is frequently in a bag for travel.  As a result my adapter stopped working in less than a year and I can't get a replacement adapter because it's hard-paired with the mouse and keyboard.
3,There is a lot to like about this keyboard; and I do like it. I like the feel of it; I like being able to just shove the number pad off to the side saving desk space; I like the ease of the Bluetooth connection. I cannot comment on the mouse as I use a Logitech trackball.However what I absolutely HATE about this keyboard is that the control key on the lower left side is big and is below a small left side Shift key. If I had a dollar for every time I have hit the Control key when I meant to hit the Shift key I wouldn't be able to pay the National Debt. But I would be able to afford a nice new car. In fact my annoyance with the Control key is the only reason I'm writing this review. I needed to vent my frustrations in some way that is more productive than throwing the keyboard across the room.
3,I really like the keyboard itself as well as the mouse.  However I've had it for 3 months now and during the first 2.5 months I had no issues.  within the last two weeks I've lost my left CTRL and my right mouse button.  They stick so bad I have to pound it and hold it to get it to work.  Both obviously needed very much.  Since the return policy on this is 30 days it looks like I'm out of luck.  I had a co-worker who also got one of these and lost his 'P' key. However it happened with the 30 day window so he was able to get it replaced.
2,Left space key started squeaking after the first week and it routinely repeats keypresses when multiple keys are pressed in rapid succession. Also my 'Y' key likes to latch off of its butterfly switch for no apparent reason randomly.For instance: type 1 then 2 then 3 extremely quickly and then let go of all 3 at the same time. You get "1232" instead of "123". It's been happening like crazy and driving me up the wall.
5,I have long been a user of Microsoft's ergonomic keyboards and mice.  This set is a big leap forward.  Unlike my older model this keyboard is wireless.  It is metal and heavy with a real feel of quality and durability. The design is a little fancier with the split on top but overall it has a very similar feel to my older plastic keyboard that now seems cheap and flimsy by comparison.  I love the separate number pad - it's like having a handheld calculator because it operates wirelessly as well at whatever angle works best for you independent of the keyboard.  Finally is the mouse.  The shape is less extreme that older models but it is still big.  I've had occupational therapy for my hands for two different problems and the therapists always recommend a B-I-G mouse.  This mouse is indeed big.  If you are looking for a really durable deluxe ergonomic keyboard in this price range I highly recommend that you consider this one.
1,Sending this back.  The mouse rattled-sounding like something broken inside.  The keyboard didn't work at all.Disappointing.
2,Keyboard looses power over and over.  I'll be typing fine for maybe 15min to one hour and then it will turn off.  If I pull out the batteries and put them back in it'll work fine again for about another hour.  I love this keyboard it feels amazing but the hardware is not stable.  I just wish it was more stable.  I also wish the insert key was father away; it's too easy to go into typeover mode.
1,Honest review of my experience without any edits to show is problems  [I pressed t and pressed . but they didn't register]I bought this either here or at BestBuy.  At first I liked the keyboard but over time it has proved frustrating.PROS:First the shape and size is nice but that's really all that there is to like about it in my opinion.CONS:I have two main problems.(1)  There's a alag between the receiver and the keyboard I assume so that keys repeat or are drod [dropped - lol that it didn't receive "dropped"].  I have a PC and I can plug the receiver into one of the front USB 3.0 ports which is closer to the keyboard and it works a little better.  But if I do that it causes different problems (see below).(2)  In Windows 10 when I wake from sleep there's a repeating key (I presume because there's no way to check).  My password field is full of dots that are repeating.  If you do a google search for this problem you'll find that many users experience this.  Also after waking from sleep the Backspace key no longer functions.  Additionally functions like CTRL+D do not work.  If I got to a keyboard testing program the program provides an audible tone indicating that a keyhas been pressed but there's no inpt.ITs bizarre.  You can plawiththe drivrs [play with the drivers] or change sb [usb] settings in theeDevice Manager.  But nothing changes.Cannot recommend.  It's simply a bad product.
1,don't buy I accidentally put my computer in bag with dongle inserted and it broke no replacement from MS this is ~$100 device I have to throw away now because of a broken dongle.ergonomic wise the wired natural keyboard 4000 is still better (just louder and wired);  the F keys on this keyboard are tiny which I use a lot for coding.
2,The mouse broke after two months of daily office use.  The back button became stuck and just continuously fires.  It's completely unusable as it just goes back in whatever program I happen to be using.  The keyboard is fine. I still prefer a regular keyboard's directional buttons and attached keypad though.
2,I have the microsoft desktop 7000 wireless combo. That set is simply awesome and cannot be beat. I was lucky to buy it before it got discontinued and now its selling for ridiculous price of $400 or so. When I started looking for another set of wireless keyboard and mouse  I ruled out Logitech because of the way key presses feel (Big mistake!).  I bought the sculpt combo thinking it is the closest match to 7000 series.  I was disappointed to see that its not. The mouse is the biggest change and its definitely not as good as the 7000. The keyboard is OK and I like the smaller foot print. I would give it 4 stars if it were not for the one stupid mistake Microsoft did. The transreceiver is really small and you cannot keep it plugged in (in your laptop or macbook). So removing it every time can cause the transreceiver to crack. Mine cracked and now the transreceiver doesn't work. You would think that based on the design Microsoft will be selling stand-alone transreceivers since it seems to be a common problem. Nope! You are SOL. So now $70 down the drain because Microsoft marketing think-tank thinks its too stupid to build universal transreceivers. Well good news for them! They just lost one more customer to logitech. Even though I do not like the feel of the Logitech keyboard I cannot risk wasting $70 again on a Microsoft one. Essentially they Microsoft lost a lot more than one customer. I informed our network engineer and we have decided to shift to Logitech as well for future orders. Not to mention my family and friends will be steered away from the lousy product design.
1,the keyboard sits fairly comfortable though the wrist pad is aging very poorly. However the receiver on this fairly expensive keyboard and mouse is completely dead.
5,I have real bad carpel tunnel and this keyboard and mouse have really given me much relief. Even during flare ups I can use this mouse quite comfortably. Some people complain of the weight of the mouse but I don't find it an issue and I am on my computer 8 hours or more per day.The keyboard is minimalistic and elegant and the number pad is great as you can store it away while not in use. Even though it is made in China -its quality materials. The keyboard has some mass to it so it stays in place and isn't as bulky as my last board freeing up more desk space. I have been using Microshafts ergo boards for 10+ years but this one is the best by far. I am not a MS fanboy by any stretch but this is a great product.Time will be the ultimate test but so far so good!
2,Ergonomically fantastic but very cheaply made. I've had two of these and both are now sitting in the trash heap with between 1 and 3 keys not working. Move on to something made to last
5,Short version: Amazingly well made great feel to the palm rest excellent assortment of shortcut buttons and great ergonomics but the mouse is not leftie-friendly.Long version: Once you get past the packaging (which is a massive pain in the backside) setup is easy - install the dongle and software (yes you will need the software as most of the feautrsd o not work without it). It took me three days of typing to get used to the layout and I'm coming from a Microsoft Comfort Keyboard 5000.The opening between the key areas is great and I already feel a difference in my wrist and fingers at the end of the day. It isn't as extravagant as a medical grade ergo keyboard but for daily typers it'll definitely make a difference.The mouse on the other hand is not suiteable for lefties and I can not find a left handed version so for now I'm stuck using 2 dongles and my old mouse.
1,Too bad such a great keyboard has a worthless mouse. Why pay extra for a mouse you just have to throw away as I did. Yes I literally threw the mouse in the trash after 1 week as it is ackward and bulky. I don't mind giving 1 star because Amazon has the same keyboard without the mouse. Now you can get a great keyboard with the mouse of YOUR choice.
2,My company bought two of these keyboards. The 10-keypad section only worked for a few days on both keyboards. The keyboard itself is just ok. I do not care for the rough texture wrist rest. I'd rather use my own gel pad wrist rest. I would not recommend.
3,The keyboard is small but mouse is big (oversized like a bumble bee). There are no lights on the keyboard at all so you won't know if you're got a mode switched unless something on your screen is telling you. The palmrest and ergonomics is good but I think the key trravel is shorter than you might expect if accustomed with non-laptop style keys.One major problem i'm getting with this set is the usb receiver lags either the keyboard or mouse when another usb device is placed in an adjacent slot next to it. The nanosecond I remove nearby usb device from neighbouring slots it works flawlessly however. So I am forced to hang this receiver on a short usb extension cord to avoid interference as I don't want all that pickyness about where I could use my usb ports.I would stick to logitech or razer mice and get a Corsair RGB in the future.
3,Summary - extremely well executed design with usability issues.  Some *users* might be able to adjust.I loved this right out of the box - super sleek black keyboard with separate number pad.  The mouse was a little "huh" as it's an ergonomic design which is intended to keep your wrist straight.  The battery covers are held on with magnets and so are really easy and cool to take on and off.  The keyboard wedge (changes the angle of the keyboard for better ergonomics also is held on with magnets.Unfortunately there's several things I don't like and they are all ergonomic and usability issues.  I currently use a Corded Microsoft Natural Elite keyboard - it has the same split arrangement as the Sculpt.  Unfortunately since the Sculpt has "Chiclet" keys (like what is on most modern laptops) which are super quiet but unfortunately the tactile is basically gone.  That means I can't touch type anymore.  Even after a week I'm still having to keep my eyes on the keyboard.The next thing is that the mouse is a bit too far away from the current type that I use (  Logitech Wireless Mouse M325 with Designed-For-Web Scrolling - Dark Silver (910-002136)         I really like the ability to flick the wheel and scroll down super fast.The kids laptop can use the keyboard for now - they're far from touch typing and the number pad will come in handy for their online math tests.One suggestion - it would have been unbelievably cool if the number pad "docked" into the bottom of the larger keyboard.  There' space even if you don't use the wedge.  This would be a good place to stash it since you really don't use it very often then you don't have to worry about where you put it.  I have some velcro tape I might employ for this.
5,I love this keyboard and mouse! I have suffered from shoulder and wrist issues for years and have been using the wave shaped keyboards which have helped with the wrist issues but the shoulder pain wouldn't go away (after an hour or so of computer use). This set up is perfect for me. The touch is nimble and crisp which I didn't realize would be so pleasant. The grip on the mouse is different so took a little bit to get used to it but I believe it has made a big difference along with the smaller keyboard allowing my arm to rest appropriately rather than stretch off to the side. I'm buying a 2nd one for use at my vacation home.
2,I've used two of these in the past year on a Mac OSX machine (I have to use Mac for work) and they keep dying. Very frustrating!
3,The feel of the keyboard is great when it works it works great but they break and they break internally!  This is the third one i have had at almost $80 a pop and its breaking again.  When i type in Office it starts selecting everything no keys are sticking the last one did this now its too late to return it so i have to buy ANOTHER one... maybe ill go back to the old school ergo Microsoft keyboard that has 3000+ stellar reviews.  Over dealing with this keyboard if it wasnt faulty it would be awesome!Update:The keyboard has broke again keys just stop working as much as i love this not ordering again just bad quality.
1,I am so tire of tech companies ignoring the 10-15% of the population that is left handed. Worse yet if a leftie version can be found it often costs exponentially more than the right handed version. I hate you @Microsoft.
2,I have 4 of these. The transceiver of the last one stopped working intermittently.The microsoft website asked me to call a number.I was put on a long hold which was especially annoying because of the repeated misleading advertisements about what Windows 10 can do.Instead of sending me a replacement they emailed me asking to ship the whole keyboard first saying that the replacement will arrive 7-10 days after they receive the keyboard. Worst of all that email was from a no-reply address. It asked me to call again (and be on hold for several minutes) if I had any issues with the process. If anyone at MS is looking these reviews for feedback here is some1) Phone is a terrible way to convey textual address such as address email addresses. A for Apple B for Ball is not F for Fun. Learn some customer-service lessons from Amazon.2) If you are really scared about customers not sending you back the defective item if you send them the replacement first you can instead charge them first send them the replacement and reimburse the charge when you get the return.
5,Twice in less than a week customers have asked for help finding a good ergonomic mouse/keyboard. This set is amazing -- easily the most natural feeling combo I have ever used. Wireless & plug and play with XP through W8.1 you can't go wrong.Things I liked: - Really simple magnetic battery doors even the optional keyboard angle attachment is magnetic and "finds it's home" with ease. - The downward angle on the keyboard with the attachment was shockingly comfortable as was the ball-shaped mouse. - The stand-alone number pad takes Velcro strips nicely for securing it to any surface. - Really high-quality this is the highest quality keyboard/mouse combo from Microsoft I have ever seen. - Outstanding value at $75 in the amazon.
1,With brand-new batteries it stops responding once or twice a week have to unplug and replug the dongle. The back button just broke on the mouse just disabled it. Pain in the butt for how little I've used it.
5,The keyboard and mouse have a great feel. I've gotten very used to both. Unfortunately the USB transceiver has cracked and you can't get a replacement part just for that from what I understand. So I would strongly advise to get the "Include 2-Year Protection for $2.48" option I wish I had done that.
2,I purchased this and shortly afterwards my computer started having weird issues that I eventually discovered were because the keyboard was sending extra commands to the computer. I returned it and received an replacement.That replacement would occasionally miss keystrokes which was frustrating but not the end of the world. After about a year of use I noticed that it was consistently missing the "L" key which since it was part of my work password was both hard to "see" and very irritating. One day after it missed three in a row I decided to pop off the L to see if there was something under it. After I did that I realized that the keys were not meant to be removed and reattached and I couldn't get it back on. So I had to throw away the keyboard and get a different one. This time I went with a different model.This keyboard is too expensive for the poor quality.
1,My USB receiver was damaged. Microsoft does not offer a replacement and their only solution is to buy a new $130 keyboard when the old one works just fine. A waste of money and environmentally irresponsible. Don't buy unless you plan to guard the USB receiver with your life!!
1,Wow. Horrible.1) There is no way to fix/replace USB dongle if lost or broken. Microsoft phone center said 'there are no options except buying a new one'.2) They know a certain number of people will break or loose the dongle (and have made it stick-out of the computer like a soar thumb to ensure this)Recommendation:* If you have a desktop the keyboard and mouse are wonderful to use.* If you have a laptop ---- DON'T get this unless you're sure you'll *never* break or loose the USB dongle.Details:Case #1402808472 ... to add insult to injury they hung up on me after saying 'I don't want to suggest that you try a universal USB dongle'; I'm pretty sure no universal dongle will work. It would have only wasted more of my time and money. What lousy service. (And no I'm not one of those people who yells at the poor call center employees who suffer complaints all day long).
5,First and foremost the build quality is spectacular.For me there was a bit of a learning curve to typing on the keyboard but after a week or so its so much more comfortable. I really feel that the mouse (yes it has a weird shape) and keyboard with lifter on have really reduced the stress on my wrists.
5,Wrist pain gone. Excellent design.
1,I bought two of these keyboards - one for work and one for home.  It worked great for over a year and then suddenly stopped working reliably.  Now I never know whether it is going to miss a keystroke.  Very annoying considering how expensive these were!  I'm now shopping for a wired alternative since the wireless seems to be crap.
2,I have to replace this keyboard every year because the 10-key stops working.
2,Very annoyed that it claims to be bluetooth but you have to use the dongle that comes with it
3,Nice layout of the keys though the function keys are too small and stiff.  Also it seems to be very cheaply manufactured - two of the keys were stick-prone and when I popped them off it turns out that they had excess injection-molded plastic sticking out of them which was preventing them from smoothly travelling.  It was easy enough to fix with an exacto knife but tells you that not a lot of care went into the manufacturing.
5,My wife and I have been using this setup for roughly 6 months. We both absolutely love it! Great feel layout and functionality. The most comfortable keyboard I have ever used. Mouse takes a few minutes to get used to but after that is also very comfortable. The only thing that would make this keyboard even better would be backlit keys.
1,I would actually leave in 3 to 4 stars for the product quality but that all becomes a moot point if anything happens to the USB dongle. The entire side becomes literally useless. You cannot get a replacement dongle and it does not work with any other technologies. Have confirmed this with Microsoft. It’s a decent keyboard and comfortable to use – although not the fastest to type on - but the irreplaceable nature of such a small fragile component makes it a risky purchase.
5,Perfect for large hands. Great angle on the keyboard. Battery for the keyboards have thusfar lasted about 8 months. The mouse needs replacement about every 6. Would be nice to have it go into sleep mode if you don't use it for a while.
2,This is a well-built and attractive keyboard/mouse set but its desirability will depend on how the user likes its ergonomic accents.The materials are high-quality so it has a premium feel. The keyboard is very comfortable to type on but as someone who has never cared for keyboards that have a split down the middle I found it unintuitive for quick typing. This will very by user of course depending on how one prefers one's key layout.The large-profile mouse is intriguing. It definitely took me some time to get accustomed to it but once I did I rather enjoyed using it. However I can't say I preferred it to standard-profile 'mice' and when I switched back to a standard mouse I didn't find myself missing the Sculpt mouse......this of course brings me to the reason for my two-star review. After about a month the mouse simply stopped responding. The keyboard still works the receiver works fine the batteries are fine; the mouse has just stopped. I don't know why. Quite frankly I'm tired of having to invest time effort and energy because my electronics stop working; I just switched back to my old keyboard and mouse. Because of this I can't comment on Microsoft's customer service. All I CAN do is remark that my Sculpt mouse stopped working after a month; your results may vary.In summary it's well-built but its ergonomic appeal will depend on your specific preference and based on my experience the mouse may  stop working after only a few weeks of use.
5,My favourite keyboard! Amazing quality too! It took me couple weeks to get use to because of the design. I've a failty left space bar. It's 10 times louder than the right one. Mice is also nice even though I don't use it.
1,This is a wonderful ergonomic keyboard!  Unfortunately I had my laptop in a backpack and the usb somehow got damaged.  Microsoft does not sell a replacement usb like others so I had to throw away a brand new keyboard and mouse!  Incredibly sad...  I wish the usb was more durable and that Microsoft offered a replacement usb.
1,I got this keyboard just a few months ago went on one work trip and the dongle broke in half in transit. Microsoft is working on a solution but in the meantime they have no replacement for just the dongle AND refuse to cover the cost of a replacement set. It's one thing to have a flimsy part of your product it's another to offer customers no reprieve when that part inevitably breaks.
1,Over the past 8 years I’ve owned all of Microsoft's Ergonomic keyboards. From the basic white ergonomic one from 2006 to the previous generation Natural Ergonomic Desktop 7000. I am a software developer and do a LOT of typing.I purchased the Sculpt Ergonomic desktop recently (not from Amazon) and was severely disappointed. The key travel on this keyboard is low and it felt like I was smashing the keys very hard. I could probably get accustom to this. The keys are also on the loud side....especially on the two space keys (come on Microsoft ... this was my only gripe about the natural ergonomic desktop 7000 and 4000 and yet you still did not fix this even with new key switches). I’ve tried the Apple keyboard and the new Logitech TK820 keyboards in store displays and these are significantly more comfortable and quieter despite not ergonomic.Perhaps by biggest disappointment was the escape key and the function keys. I do a lot of typing in vi and debugging that require the use of the function keys. These keys on the top row were very clicky and loud. Apart from their loudness I have no idea whether the keys are depressed or not when I click them. These have very low key travel which is completely different from the rest of the keyboard. If you have experience on the 4000 or 7000 keyboard the feel is like the multimedia and special buttons on these older generation keyboards. I've never liked the "baseball" shaped mouse on the Microsoft ergonomic 7000 desktop and the mouse in the sculpt ergonomic desktop was more of the same. In particular I am not a fan of the low dpi and slow tracking. I still rely to my wired "gaming" mouse which offers better tracking although I'm not a gamer.I'm sure this product have some advantages to it but I'm so disappointed after using this product for one week that I'll return to the retailer. After using Microsoft ergonomic desktops for over 8 years it's time to switch brands.
2,Both the keyboard and mouse stopped working within 4 months of purchase (I think the wireless USB sticks failed). When they worked they were great!
1,i got one of it and the abnormally large USB dongle is broken. so hopefully someone can replace it otherwise the whole set is waste.best!
5,Came so quick and great quality.
5,I have been a user of the "Explorer 4000" and Microsoft ergo keyboards for more than 10 years. This latest version is fantastic! It took me a day to get used to the slightly more compact design but the key feel is awesome I am no longer compelled to mash my keys. IThe mouse is very comfortable in the hand though it can be awkward for gaming. Now that I am used to its "grip" I use it to game constantly.This is a perfect set!
1,Keyboard and mouse are actually great but if you lose the wireless receiver you can literally chuck them both in the trash because Microsoft WILL NOT replace the receiver. Oh and don't bother buying a second mouse or keyboard thinking that since it's the same exact product surely the receiver will work with any of them...it won't. There's one receiver to each piece of equipment and when that's gone the product is now trash. Has to be the most environmentally irresponsible greedy irrational moronic thing I've ever seen from a tech company. I don't care how nice the products were I will never buy microsoft accessories ever again. Lesson learned
1,Was given this as a gift a few years ago but USB dongle broke recently. When I called Microsoft for a replacement dongle not only does the entire set (keyboard and mouse) need to be replaced (they don't sell just the dongle) but they will only replace it if the product was purchased within 3 years. On top of that you have to send the parts back and pay shipping. For a dongle that sticks out and breaks pretty easily this is definitely not worth the hefty price.
1,Bought this until my other keyboard arrives that i bought on Ebay.  Keyboard is not very responsive very laggy.  I do transcription for a living and the lag is a HUGE downer. Space bar on left doesn't respond very well.  I feel like I have to POUND the keys to get them to work.  Won't be buying another one; in fact this one is going in the trash as soon as my Microsoft Ergonomic keyboard arrives (which unfortunately can't be bought very cheaply other than on eBay).HATE HATE HATE THIS KEYBOARD
5,I love this key board... I have two. One at work and one at home. It's sleek quiet and helps with my carpotunel.
2,it fulfill the ergonomic purpose but there is no light to indicate the cap lock and or/ num lock is on. So I had to contact IT to get some of my passwords reset because I was typing with CAPS and my password was in lower case. So if I need to check if the keyboard is on capital I need to open word or excel or notepad and type something. I can't believe they let the light out of this model.
1,It is a great keyboard.  My business moved locations and the USB dongle was not transfer over.  According to Microsoft the keyboard cannot be synced with another USB receiver.  Every other major manufacturer makes their USB receiver swappable between different units.  I am not out $80 due to this design.
5,This is the keyboard and mouse you've been looking for.
2,The good thing is that the key actuation is great on this keyboard: crisp precise well weighted and much better the predecessor the 4000. If the review was just of the key actuation then this keyboard would get 5 stars. Unfortunately the keyboard comes with a mouse that is underwhelming. It is an ok mouse but it feels like a step back from the one that comes with the 4000 and so the bundle looses a star. What really hurts (literally) is the palm rest. Let me say that I do not have freakishly large hands. I would say my hands are normal sized (I'm 5'8). I can barely palm a basketball. I don't know who tested this keyboard but it must have been someone with the hands of a hobbit because the ends of my wrist rest on the very sharp edge of the palm rest (which is un-cushioned. Why Microsoft?). This causes quite a bit of pain and might be contributing to some numbness in my fingers due to reduced bloodflow or pressure on the median nerve. The pain does not appear when I type on my laptop keyboard (which is not ergonomic at all) so clearly this keyboard is not helping. If you have small palms this might not be an issue for you but be forewarned.
1,WARNING- MICROSOFT WILL NOT REPLACE THE USB ADAPTER IF YOU LOSE IT (and the damn thing is small)!  You will have to buy a brand new set. For me given where we are with electronic waste forced obsolescence of technology and freaking climate change this is a deal breaker for me and I will not buy again. Its a bummer because I liked the keyboard.
5,Very good price is great
1,Keystrokes frequently don't register. I'd say once every few hundred keystrokes so maybe once every 5 minutes of use. This is with the dongle in one of three positions within 5 feet line of sight to the keyboard. Awful.
5,Easy on my wrists arms and shoulders easy to use nicely compact with the keypad being separate. I highly recommend it!
1,I can't believe how much inferior this keyboard is compared to the legendary Microsoft ergonomic keyboards.There is absolutely no response from the keys. Key layout has been changed for absolutely no reason. Mouse is too small and doesn't feel as good as much cheaper mice.I would very strongly recommend avoiding this product. And I say this as a die-hard fan of Microsoft's ergonomic keyboards.
5,Great Product! I took it to work and now 20 new keyboards later it has become the envy in our office. Love it!!
1,One of the best ergonomic design but do not waste your money on this product. Once you loose the usb wireless dongle there is no replacement and you will have to throw the product. I had to throw my relatively new working keyboard because I lost the usb dongle. Tried to contact customer support and they said it's how it's designed. Very poor design! Also the battery needs replacement very frequently.
2,So I use the computer at least... 4-6 hours out of the day doing work etc. for recreation. I have nothing bad to say about this product's battery life (great) ergonomic features (awesome) and the ease of use takes some getting used to the sideways mouse but once you get used to it you won't want to go with anything else. It's truly a great keyboard the keys are silent and nice too in that fashion.However after barely 4.5 months of use and it's already given up on me- the keys no longer respond as smoothly and quickly as I prefer it to and I had to go through warranty (easy to do) to get a new one.. but at this point I'm more likely going to use something else from now on or go back to the trust mechanical keyboard as I don't want to be getting a new one every few months.. it's truly very beautiful and functionally great but the durability and longevity is a serious serious issue.
5,I have received product from amazon. Not sure why people has mentioned a lot on the key/func buttons...It's all working perfectly fine...the function key need to be switched on and off which is not a big deal at all.Once you use it more often you will just get used to it.The only thing is the key board may be a little loud but doesn't bother me much at all. I love it.
5,I received this about half an hour ago and I am already loving it!  My wrists have been hurting badly from carpal syndrome and this feels really comfortable for my hands/wrists.  It's really easy to install even when using a Macintosh.  Its look and feel is nice and elegant! For the moment I completely recommend it!
2,I would've given this set 5 stars had the dongle held out but it's pretty fragile and (per another review on here) there are no replacements - forcing you to order another set.  Had that not been an issue and it lasted only a few months I would've given this 5 stars.  The keyboard is great the mouse is responsive and having the 10-key separate is pretty handy.
1,My company sent me this setup after being I was diagnosed with CTS. My USB receiver disintegrated after only being taken in and out of the port a handful of times. Nothing generic works and Microsoft refused to replace it.  Lesson learned: DO NOT BUY MICROSOFT ACCESSORIES.
5,Fantastic Keyboard / Mouse set. I have bought of four of these for all of my computer setups including my workstation at work.
1,It needs a dongle to work. This dongle is easily damaged and irreplaceable. So if the tiny dongle gets broken the whole lot becomes landfill. Don't buy it. Otherwise a fantastic piece of kit.
5,Sleek design - Comfortable - Very User Friendly. If you're looking to purchase a new keyboard/mouse combo spend the extra dollars and get the Sculpt Ergonomic. Personally I love that the numeric pad is separate; makes things increasingly efficient.If you have very little desk space I would not recommend this product as it has a total of three pieces. Instead check out the Logitech K400 which is less than half the price.
1,world's worst usb receiver!  It will break if you accidentally leave it in your laptop... in the on the go world we live in it and when your paying this much its a problem the receiver is so large.
5,This keyboard mouse number pad system is awesome.  Set up was very quick once I learned to ignore the install / permission error on the Company's VPN.This system is very easy to use and sets up well for casual "lap" work as well as for traditional desktop work.  Over all this is the most comfortable data input system I have had ever.So far battery life is good and system reliability is great.
1,The keyboard is poorly designed and some soft and off center key presses are not registered. Issue appears to be random and EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING. Google Microsoft Sculpt keystroke and you will see complaints here and there.Updating drivers does not solve the problem and it is unlikely that it is a bluetooth problem because its the right spacebar key that is the most likely to drop keystrokes.It is unlikely to be a manufacturing issue as i have bought 3 over the span of a couple years from different stores and they all have the same problem. I love the concept and a big fan of Microsoft's ergonomic keyboards but this is just plain ridiculous.
5,Oh my gosh! Immediate difference in the pain from my CTS. I love this keyboard so far. Well worth every penny. Plus it is just got some amazing features. I love it!
1,I think this is some cruel joke but there is one key that gets stuck (either by the physical contact or the wireless transmission) and that is the [backspace] key. So instead of deleting one letter as one normally expects when pushing the backspace key once it repeats the backspace command and begins rapidly deleting all of your text/data anything that gets in its way.
2,I wanted an ergonomic keyboard that was stylish and clean looking to stop my hands from hurting.I got this keyboard mouse combo but it ended up becoming entirely useless after a few months.It isn't a bluetooth device so you get a large usb dongle and if you lose or break that(which happened when I forgot it was attached to my laptop and put it in my bag) then the keyboard becomes an $80 paperweight. I called Microsoft and they said that they couldn't replace the usb dongle and now my keyboard and mouse were entirely useless.But while using it the device was very comfortable but I won't be getting another one if the dongle breaks so easily and cannot be replaced.
1,I actually don't hate it - was too discouraged by the reviews to order it. But there is an alternative ergonomic keyboard which is quite sturdy and reliable!  Look up Goldtouch.com keyboards.
1,I like the look and feel of this keyboard.  However the Dongle is the downfall.  It sticks out too far so I have to remove it.  I've had one break and another I lost.  They are not replaceable.  I now have two keyboards sitting in my closet that are of no use because the tiny little dongle is not replaceable.
5,Comfortable. Works on each and every click even when it is 4 meter away from receiver. Battery lasts longer.However Power is not turned off automatically when not in use. So It would be great improvement if power is shutdown automatically by detecting no activity.
1,Total trash for the price. Drops 1 out of every 100 keys. Signal gets worse as you go more than a few inches away. The buttons seem to often randomly choose what to do. this week the backspace and arrow keys operate the back and forward on my browsers and I cant even type anything and will need to use an old keyboard from now on . I have to keep this review short cause i didnt take the keyboard off and put a better 3$ keyboard on and every mistake i make erases everything I write when i press backspace and the delete key literally does nothing. Sometimes I can reset the PC and it doesnt do this for a minute or so.  The settings in the software are pure trash compared to the microsoft 6000 line. You can only set like 2 keys ! WTF! All those useless keys you are forced at the top of this cant be changed but 2. Not only that
2,The ergo thing takes some getting used to but it's WAY more comfortable in the long run.EDIT:  I had to drop this to two stars.  My keyboard was occasionally dropping out and I didn't know the cause.  I swapped batteries etc and no use.  Ultimately I had to take the receiver that was in a USB slot in the back of the computer and put it in the slot on the front of the computer.  Then it started working.  But I REALLY don't like to burn a port on the front of the computer.  This thing should have the range to reach to the back of the computer which is 3 ft. away.  That's unacceptable to me.
1,I bought this sculpt keyboard and loved it until I started having problems 3 months in. The USB would not be detected by the computer. I would reboot and it would work but now the sensor is broken completely and the keyboard is useless. I called Microsoft for technical support and they transferred me 4 TIMES until I got some kind of "out of service" message on my last call and was dropped. I spent 25 minutes being redirected and they couldn't transfer me to the right person. I was happy enough with the keyboard that I would have spent money to get a replacement USB but now I am considering other options due to the terrible customer service and unreliable hardware.
5,Instant satisfaction and relief from the pain I was feeling in my wrists and hands. It feels good to touch and great to type on. The mouse is also very responsive and feels great in the hand.
5,I love this keyboard and the number pad. The mouse is bigger than I expected but the action and features on the keyboard far outweigh the any issues I have with the mouse.
2,Most features work really well: battery life (really months) travel of the normal keys the stability of the keyboard using the magnetic stand (it hardly ever falls off). Still.. some elements really are irritating: if you press either the alt-key the shift-key the control-key or the capslock key for just a bit too long.. that key remains pressed (not physically) until you press it again. As if a sort of 'sticky key' feature is built into the keyboard (the sticky key feature in windows settings is off). There is no known way to turn it off.The second big drawback is the switch for the function keys. This should have been a separate Fn or so not a switch.These two problems could/should be addressed by Microsoft by creating configuration choices via an updated driver. Unfortunately I would not expect this anytime soon.
1,Just a Warning before buying this. The blue tooth dongle of this device is so poorly designed that they break easily. Once it breaks you are out of luck. Microsoft does not sell this part. And does not back of their equipment. 6 Months of ownership and now it is JUNK. What an incredible waste of money.  You can google this. I'm not the only one.
5,Now finally fits in my backpack!Detachable numpad is a blast - mouse much closer.I miss the dedicated volume up/down but I'll survive.The keys are perfect the Fs are OK.The mouse felt weird for a day. Now it's great.
1,While the functionality on the Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Wireless Mouse is very good the transr eceiver stopped functioning. Because the transreceiver is uniquely paired with the mouse and keyboard the spare parts department at Microsoft couldn't replace the transreceiver. Here is my advice if you want to take a chance on this item save your receipt! They will offer a refund or replacement if the trans receiver breaks. Unfortunately for me I didn't save my receipt.
5,Excellent ergonomic keyboard.  Detached number pad is a great invention.  I wish I had one years ago.
5,sleek design the numeric pad is a bonus and the mouse is ergonomic. would definitely buy again. would prefer wired.
2,Keyboard is comfortable keys are responsivefunction keys are really bad designedOrdered 16 from 3 different vendors so far had to RMA 4 of them 3 are the keyboard issue 1 is the number pad issueDiscovered the 5th one randomly has left Ctrl stuck and a 6th one that the mouse left click is hard to click after "1" day of useMS needs to improve their quality control!
1,Agree with most of the negatives you see in the other reviews.  The ultimate product killer is the transceiver which you cannot purchase if it has issues.  I have used the keyboard for over 1 year now but since I use a laptop I keep the transceiver in the laptop and I guess over time it has bumped into things and does not work 100% of the time.  Physically it has no damage.  Keep in mind the transceiver sticks out 3-5 times further than the typical Logitech transceivers.  So I would only recommend this keyboard to someone with a desktop computer where the transceiver will not get bumped.  Also it could be used for someone who does not type a whole bunch and especially does not use the Function keys or keys next to your right hand.  The other positive if you can live with the negatives is that I do not use the 10 key much so I have it above the keyboard which then allows the mouse on the right to be very close to the keyboard for quick and easy access.  If Microsoft improves most of the issues then they would have a great product!
5,This is the best keyboard mouse combination I've found. Very relaxing.
1,This worked great for about eight months.Then the individual components began dying. Yes I tried changing the batteries. First the ten key went. Then the mouse became unreliable. Then the mouse died. Finally the main keyboard died.The mouse is kind of a funny shape. It takes some getting used to and I never really liked it as much as some of my other mice.The keyboard and ten key are the new "island" style and I liked them very much.But I expect my devices to last more than 8 months.
1,Really cheaply made. The usb broke very easily and you cannot replace it. It's paired with your keyboard and mouse so you have to buy a whole new set. Really stupid. Makes no sense. It's difficult to use this keyboard also. Make major mistakes even after using it for past five months or so. I used to type 80 wpm not one hand has to hunt and peck. Difficult to use.
5,I just got this keyboard a few days ago and I totally love it. It's very very comfortable. I would totally recommend this product.
2,I have been using this keyboard for one year and do like it. So why only 2 starts?1. F keys and ESC are terrible. MS people do you hear me? Unfortunately they don't. But if you do - please please fix the F keys.2. The layout of del/pgup/pgdwn buttons is neither standard nor comfortable.BTW the mouse is nothing special. There are many ergonomic mice on the market that IMO are better.
1,Dongle is fragile resulting in useless keyboard and mouse.  I wont buy a Microsoft keyboard or mouse again.
2,Extremely difficult to get use to mostly because the number pad and mouse are normally both just to the right of the keyboard.  the split is awkward and just as difficult to learn.  Keys are now no longer working on it (H and P)... can't spell "help me out here" on it!Its awesome looking though!
1,USB receiver is very large and breaks right away on a notebook. It is not possible to pair the keyboard via Bluetooth. You have to buy another keyboard.
5,The best functioning keyboard set for with anyone that has ergonomic requirements. It's a great design and well made for the desktop user.
1,horrible laggy keeyoard i am typin gon it rigg now andit can barely keep up with me. half the kes dont register.  bluetooth sucks.
5,This is a really well built keyboard and mouse.  All the components like the batter cover and keyboard elevator snap together with magnets.
5,Excellent product. Just what I needed.
1,I will admit that I am in a pretty frustrated state right now but I think that anyone using this keyboard and having this issue would be.  I bought the keyboard in May 2014 and immediately loved it.  I was surprised by the user who said that she had small hands and couldn't type on this.  I have really small hands and I am very comfortable on this keyboard.The trouble began in July 2014.  The keyboard started skipping letters.  I thought that it was me at first.  The problem got progressively worse.  I called Microsoft support and after more than an hour on the phone with almost no troubleshooting they sent me a new set.  That set was even worse.  The problem progressed with both keyboards until I was waiting five and ten minutes for the keyboard to start working again.  Again I called Microsoft.  Again little to no help trouble shooting.  They just offered to send me my money back after I mail them back the products (which is fine of course) and wait another 6 weeks.My frustration is that the mouse and keypad work fine so the connection with the USB is clearly OK.  The keyboard is the only problem so there must be a problems somewhere right?  The only advice that I got was to go into the properties and check that they said that the device was working properly.I work for a software company.  I type all day long.  I also trouble shoot all day long.  This was not helpful.  My rating would be higher if not for the dysfunctional keyboardS and the serious lack of customer support.
1,bought one and it stopped working after one month.
1,10 Key / Number pad stops working (or works intermittently which is arguably more annoying). Symptoms started ~3 months out. Shrugged it off. Continued til about 10 months out where it's now failing completely. Not recommended for any kind of task (accounting data entry) where you need to be 100% accurate with 10 key.+++
1,This is a battery killer Keyboard. I have to replace the batteries every other week. Would not recommend this to anyone.
5,great ergonomic design.
1,This is keyboard 2 of 3 (of the same model ) that has now failed.  MS replaced the first one under warranty (which has now failed) and i bought another with an extended warranty - which I normally don't do.  The keyboard stops seeing keys - on the last one it was the N and D keys - on this one - its the c when the shift key is on.  It's really too bad as this is a great great keyboard otherwise.
1,On the surface this keyboard is amazing.I would get into how awesome it is but read another review to hear the good points. This review will not be a kind one.Pros: Keyboard works magnetic battery compartments are so easy to pull off with ease.Cons: 10 key stopped working after a week.Over an hour goggling turned up nothing. I thought maybe it had a bunk battery but it took 3 people to figure out how to open the battery compartment. Why such great design on the main keyboard and such crap design on the 10key?  I would return this to the store purchased but I bought and brought it back to Japan... It's not possible to return it.  When I finally got the battery compartment open I went to two different stores and couldn't find the battery.It's so great to have a nice new keyboard with a useless 10key.DON'T BUY THIS KEYBOARD IF YOU CARE ABOUT THE 10 KEY. I AM NOT TO ONLY ONE WHO HAS HAD PROBLEMS>
1,Terrible keyboard. Main selling point is that its ergonomic but the keys are not even mechanical. They are made out of cheap membrane/laptop scissors keys which have hardly any travel so a lot of typing causes fatigue  on your fingertips. Stick to a mechanical keyboard if you do lots of typing. They have a lot more travel and registers the keypresses without needing to 'bottom out'.
1,Keyboard stopped working after sometime. However the separate numpad is working. But it is useless now.
1,This keyboard uses a little USB receiver to connect the computer to the devices. This means you either need to leave the receiver in your laptop or plug it in every time you reach your work station. This would not be so bad if Microsoft used a secure method of wireless communication but it looks like they were more concerned about battery life than security. It is now possible to buy (for less than $100) hardware to capture Microsoft wireless keystrokes. Search the keywords "KeySweeper Microsoft" for details.
1,Terrible product. If you lose the USB receiver this product no longer works. You can't buy a universal receiver to replace the old receiver because this product by design doesn't support connection to other bluetooth devices. Also the usability of this product is questionable it looks amazing but keyboard and mouse feel weird when using it.
1,I was in love with this combo IN LOVE. Mouse was great to use and keyboard was great and comfortable... and then I accidentally broke the USB transceiver. There is no replacement and no way to repair it. What is the solution? Spend another 80 bucks to buy a new combo...It's like saying "Hey you broke the key of your car ? No problem. Buy another car!" It's unacceptable!
1,DO NOT BUY THIS KEYBOARD!There is no pairing software provided by Microsoft in case you loose or misplace your wireless receiver. So that means if you loose $129 dollars by loosing a receiver that is smaller than a inch.
1,I Don't recommend anybody to buy this. I have two of these for home and office and both of them broke within a year. It is just too much hassle to do a warranty claim on this.I would often get a connection problem where the keys I typed wouldn't show up ont eh computer or only a few of them would show up. The mouse also has a terrible battery housing. The batteries come loose due to their own weight and you have to open it and push them in again.Overall a terrible product because of the reliability. Like many microsfot products it is good only on surface but not deep within
1,I had a microsoft natural ergonomic keyboard that I bought it to use it at work. It was great. But I took it home and replaced it with Microsoft Sculpt desktop at work. This product does not compare well with natural ergonomic keyboard. I still have nagging pain in my wrist area.This keyboard is smaller in size than the natural ergonomic keyboard. The function keys are smaller. So for programmers this is not good.I have to sometime look down to see if I am hitting the function key correctly when I am debugging.When someone is ordering for ergonomic reasons being pretty is not a preference. Looks like they wanted to make this product look pretty on your desktop. The curve is not all that good. It flattens out towards the pinky finger which defeats the purpose of being ergonomic.I wanted to see if i can order the natural ergonomic keyboard but its priced at $299 here in amazon. I bought the natural keyboard and mouse for $90 couple of years back. Very annoying.Not satisfied at all. :-(
1,I have been using Microsoft Natural Keyboard for ages now and i simply adore them. Recently my natural keyboard broke and I upgraded to this shiny new Desktop keyboard/mouse package.Improvement:For sure it is not noisy and the ctrl+spacebar key do not get stuck as with previous natural keyboardsWhere it sucks:The spacing between the keys are horrendously bad worst of all the Insert and Enter Key are so closed to each other than almost half the times i press Enter. I wish i could return the keyboard back and downgrade to Natural Keyboard. Lastly if you work on the console and need to use arrow keys and enter keys together you'd be in surprise I can bet half the time you'd not be able to press enter (the orientation between the keys requires re-learning).Overall it is a good hardware but the designer who placed these keys should be punished. I highly encourage not to buy this desktop package and stick to other keyboards
1,The keys are great no doubt about it comparable to Thinkpad T430 keys. But I returned it because the keys are misplaced and was difficult to use. I am a software developer and for me navigating through my code with arrow keys home/pageup/pagedown keys are very important. It is a big mistake on Microsoft part by repositioning the keys and it significantly slows down my code editing speed. If you are less dependent on keyboard and more of a mouse user this is a great keyboard but if you are a developer stick to Microsoft Ergonomic 4000.
1,I had been waiting for this keyboard to arrive and found one unit today. Tried to install it with my Lenovo W510 running Win 7. But it just would not install the software. I went online and downloaded directly from the download site the installation software. Again the software kept repeating over the same information that my system is incompatible. Needing a Win 7! I nearly pulled my hair off. I am running the Win 7 fully updated etc. Yet this keyboard software refuses to install.  I am so frustrated and disappointed that I am returning the keyboard tomorrow first thing. Its probably a software issue but I am not going to pay for something that does not work on my laptop. Microsoft really should have resolved this before launching the keyboard to the public. Probably the last time I am buying a keyboard from MS. Too bad for you guys.
1,I've had two of these....One was a replacement because the original was typing nonsense on its own and my computer was telling me to boot up in safe mode because there was a problem whenever the wireless receiver was in the USB port. The replacement worked fine for two or three weeks and then the same thing happened. Computer will not boot with the receiver in the port. This is a glitchy product.
1,I have been waiting to get my set so badI really like itBut when I opened the box the keyboard was not really clean !! There were dust and dirt here and thereWill more than than the "U" button is not working properly !I have to push it very hard to type the letter !!To be honest I feel bit disappointed !! because it was my first time to buy something from Amazon.com !
1,What is this..... the keyboard has to first get a wakeup keypress before it registers a key. So I always have to double press what I first intend to press!!!! And the mouse is pure crap. This is a horrible set to be honest.. Not great by any means for the average person.
4,Lets get the little things out of the way:The keyboard is wireless.  Requires 2 AAA batteriesThe Numpad is wireless and separate from the keyboard. It requires a CR2430 3V Lithium Coin Battery (commonly called a "watch battery")The Mouse is wireless and requires 2 AA batteriesAll batteries are included with the keyboardThe mouse keyboard and numpad require a single USB connection. The USB connector is a small dongle which can be stored within the mouse's battery compartment - it's about the size of a quarter.The cover for the battery on the mouse and main keyboard as well as the riser for the keyboard are all magnetic snapping into place but having no mechanical hinge. It is possible for the battery covers to fall off if you accidentally drop the hardware but the batteries are held pretty securely inside and will stay in place even without the covers. It is also really fun to snap the covers and risers into place and I did it far too many times. The battery cover on the 10-key numpad is held on with a screw and friction brackets (it is not fun to play with).Layout --------------------------------------------------------I am a long time user of the Microsoft Natural line ever since their first "split" keyboard back in 1994. For those who have used the Natural line before the layout of the Sculpt is similar to the "Elite" line. The main body of the keyboard maintains the Delete/Home/End/PgUp/PgDown/Insert keys but they are in a double-row column. The arrow keys are in the traditional "pyramid" shape but due to space restrictions the left arrow shares space with the right CTRL key under the right Shift. The separate numpad contains the full-sized 10-key layout as well as the NumLock an app button (defaulting to opening the calculator) a clear button (for use in calculator) and a Backspace key.As a keyboard "purist" the 6 key layout is annoying in a full-sized keyboard. I find myself smacking the wrong keys because they aren't where I think they should be. I haven't had to look at my keyboard layout in years and having to hunt and peck for the Page Up key is annoying. However it's a small thing and something I'm sure I'd probably get used to over time. If you're a gamer trying to use a Natural Keyboard (bless you) the arrow keys won't seem quite as bad as other squashed six-key layouts because they decided to keep the pyramid configuration.Keys and Buttons --------------------------------------------------------The Sculpt keyboard is a "chiclet" style keyboard similar to those found on laptops. The keyboard is a rubber dome membrane-style keyboard utilizing scissor switches. For those unfamiliar with scissor switches these style switches tend to require less distance to activate and give a more solid "bouncy" feel. If you had previously used a Microsoft Natural Keyboard 4000 and did not like the "squishy" feeling of the key action these may feel better to you. They obviously do not feel anything like Cherry switches but I do like the action much better than my old 4000 (I favor MX Blue's on my mechanicals). For those who are office users the keys are pretty silent - honestly the only key that I hear is the space bar. All of the normal row keys are silent. Like most USB keyboards the Sculpt only recognizes around four to five simultaneous keypresses. Also the media buttons are not gone but instead are set as an Alt-Function of the Function keys. In order to access alt-functions there is a small physical switch on the upper-right corner of the keyboard. You have to set this switch to Function or Alt-Function (White or Blue). So if you wanted to play your video refresh a webpage and then pause your video the order of operations would be thus: Set the Function keys to Alt (Blue) Press F1 (Play) Set Function keys to normal (White) hit F5 (refresh) set Function keys to Alt (Blue) Hit F1. It's a little odd. The other option is simply to no longer use the secondary functions. The annoying implementation makes you think Microsoft wants to phase these out anyway.The Sculpt mouse is a side-rest mouse the hand placement basically the same as the old   Microsoft Natural Wireless Laser Mouse 6000        . If you've never used a side rest mouse before it will probably take a little time to get used to. The "pulling" motion feels a little odd at first. The mouse uses Microsoft's Blue Track technology meaning that the mouse will track properly even on transparent surfaces. I have a sheet of 1/10 inch plexiglass on top of my maple desk - my older optical laser mice jump all over place when on this surface however Blue Track mice work just fine.The only dislike I have with the mouse is with the tertiary buttons.  The primary right-click and wheel mouse are fine and no different from most mice. The wheel does retain both the scrolling up/down as well as the rarely used side-to-side functionality. However instead of the standard back and forward buttons Microsoft has opted for a back and Windows key button. This wouldn't really bother me as you can easily remap the Windows key to something more useful but the placement of the keys feels very unnatural. Perhaps it's due to hand size but when I rest my hand on the mouse my thumb does not rest on the buttons naturally. When compared to the old Natural Laser Mouse 6000 the keys on the Sculpt mouse are set forward similar to where the second front button is located on the 6000. Also instead of having two buttons at the same level the Windows key is on top and the back key is set in the thumb recurve area. The back button also takes a fair amount of force to actuate making the use of the button a wholly annoying process.It should be noted that when I initially installed the keyboard and mouse Windows 7 had no problem loading drivers but it defaulted to a generic mouse and keyboard. In order to completely configure all of the media buttons as well as the secondary mouse buttons you will need to download the Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center from the Microsoft.com product page.Flow and Comfort (aka: Learning your Home Row) --------------------------------------------------------The ergonomics line is all about comfort and natural motion. In this I have always liked the feel of the natural line. While not as truly ergonomic like the   Kinesis         or kits like the ErgoDox it is probably the best easily obtained keyboard line in this regard.For those who have never used a split keyboard it forces you into using the standard Home Row style typing method. If you do a lot of typing through the day you can expect to feel comfortable with the key layout within a week. If you only type sparingly it'll probably take upwards of a month.  With frequent use the side rest style mouse will probably feel normal within a few days.The wrist rest on the keyboard is nice - it is not super plush like a couch but a simple thin layer of foam covered in a "pleather" type covering over plastic. For users of the old Natural 4000 the rest feels the same maybe a tiny bit stiffer. The keyboard comes with a riser which tilts the keyboard forward - you may or may not use the riser depending on your chair-to-desk height.The mouse has an O-ring shape on the underside where the mouse makes contact with the surface. Most mice usually only have three or four small contact points and I was afraid that this might make the mouse feel sluggish but it glides nicely. A bit of Teflon tape probably wouldn't hurt though.Conclusion --------------------------------------------------------Microsoft's Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop is a good successor to the Natural line but in general a bit of a mixed bag.While I wish Microsoft had opted to go with mechanical switches for their keys the scissor switch keys a great improvement over the squishy plain rubber dome keys of the old Natural 4000 keyboard. While making the 10-key numpad separate from the main body of the keyboard probably won a few fans the six-key layout seems like a needless change. Moving from a wired to wireless is nice when keeping desk clutter down but a total of five batteries in order to power keyboard and mouse seems excessive.Unfortunately due to the odd placement of the tertiary buttons I am not a fan of the newly revamped Sculpt mouse. Given that the old 6000 is no longer available the new Sculpt isn't a bad mouse for ergonomic use but using the back button became something that I had to think about and change hand position to use rather than being a natural feeling motion.As an end note - Why is everything GLOSSY?Everything except the keys themselves and the side buttons on the mouse are a piano black gloss. The mouse looked nasty after simply removing it from the box and putting it on my desk. The keyboard is a jumbled mess of random fingerprints and smudges.All-in-all if it were possible to pick up only the keyboard I'd be a fan of that rather than the keyboard + mouse combo. However as the keyboard does not seem to be a standalone product at this time it's coin-flip in my opinion on whether to pick up this bundle or not. If you have an old 4000 keyboard that you need to replace I would say get this product simply because the key action is so much nicer. Keep your old 6000 mouse though.  For the folks who have never had a split keyboard the Sculpt is a great representative of the line and a good keyboard by itself and despite my complaining the mouse is not bad just a little annoying for a nitpicker like myself.**Small edit - Many folks have pointed out that Microsoft is planning on releasing the keyboard as a standalone product later on however it was not available as of this review.
3,The Sculpt arrives all in 1 long box.  Please note that three sets of batteries come installed:* Two AAA batteries in the keyboard* Two AA batteries in the mouse* One 3V 270mAh battery in the separate flat numpad.UNPACKINGThe 3 items are tightly packed in cardboard and thin black foam sheets. It will be difficult to get the keyboard out without making some room or ripping cardboard left and right.  Assuming you're not a throw caution to the wind and rip things apart wildly type of person first unpack the mouse and the separate numpad. I found it easiest to simply pull up and remove their cardboard setting; it feels heavy as if there is a user manual or something underneath the mouse and numpad but there isn't.  Now that you have room to maneuver tackle removing the keyboard.You'll need to remove the cardboard corners holding down the keyboard and then likely ply open one end of the cardboard setting (probably the end where you removed the mouse/numpad cardboard setting).Underneath the keyboard is the quick set up guide the warranty info and the usual tiny print legalese pamphlets. There is also a plastic riser if you like the front part of your keyboard elevated. There is no CD/DVD/diskette.FIRST GLANCEThe keyboard itself is smaller than Microsoft's premier keyboard the   Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Desktop 7000         (my current keyboard) although once you set the separate numpad next to the Sculpt they are roughly the same length. The height and depth of the Sculpt compared to the 7000 is less in large part because the Sculpt does not have the various Internet Explorer keys. This means that the Sculpt fits much better into a under-the-desk keyboard tray.  The keyboard also has a nicely cushioned wrist-wrest along its bottom.The Sculpt mouse is smaller by about ½-inch in length than the Microsoft Natural Wireless Laser Mouse 7000 (my current mouse) and smaller by about 1/8 inch in height. Again this should help in tight situations such as under-the-desk keyboard drawers.The actual white lettering/numbering on the keyboard is stuck on - just as on a laptop keyboard. The white lettering/numbering is not printed on so if you've used the clear nail polish trick on previous keyboards to get the lettering/numbering to last longer be cautious with the Sculpt's tiny laptop-esque lettering/numbering stickers.INSTALLATIONAfter removing the safety tabs from each item it's time for installation.  (Note:  Although it *seems* like you should find a coin or flathead screwdriver to open the small screw on the back of the numpad you do NOT need to do this - simply pull out the blue safety tab from under the battery slot.)The mouse is the driver for this whole wireless setup so once you've lifted the underside and pulled the blue safety tab you'll need to pull out the small wireless USB receiver. This goes into a USB 2.0 or greater slot on your computer (if you have a desktop or tower it may be easiest to use one of your front USB slots).Now - let me pause here and suggest one thing that is going to be a real problem with the Sculpt mouse.  The bottom of the mouse is next to IMPOSSIBLE to put back on. It's the entire oval - not a door. Do you know how difficult it is to snap back into a place an oval when you have no actual snap tabs but instead a groove that fits all around the oval?!  I gave up after 10 minutes and used the mouse without the bottom put back on.  I foresee a LOT of complaints about this.  It's such a simple item and thus ridiculous for it to be this difficult. I can only imagine how difficult this will be for someone with even a smidge of arthritis. Thus without question -1/2 a star.The keyboard and mouse and separate numpad install promptly without any download of drivers necessary.USAGEThe keyboard feels nice on the heel of the hand; as I mentioned the wristpad cushion is very well done - not too thick not too thin.The keys are fairly flat. It feels like typing on a laptop keyboard. In fact exactly like a laptop keyboard. Like most keyboards today there are no springs under the keys just sensors. However just like with a laptop keyboard the keys are fairly flat and close to the sensor making a soft "tick-tick" as you type. So if you like that "plunk" of a solid keyboard you know won't give out on you anytime soon you won't find it here with the Sculpt. That said the keys are responsive so if you're simply looking for a keyboard and won't be actually typing 4+ hours a day the keyboard will be just fine. And its aesthetically pleasing appearance will be a nice bonus.However by making the keyboard so aesthetically pleasing looking some sacrifices were clearly necessary. The function keys are right above the number keys with no additional vertical break between the function keys and the rest of the traditional keyboard set up. The F7 7 Y H and N keys all are equidistant. Likewise the arrow keys the delete key the home and end keys insert page up and down keys are crammed adjacent to the Enter key just as on a 15-inch or greater laptop keyboard. As I'm typing this review on my desktop I find myself first reaching for where I *think* the delete key should be ... and then having to treat it as if I'm on my laptop. Whether you might detract a 1/2 star for this or not is a personal preference. I do not like typing on a laptop keyboard but since this is a general review I did not take off for this.The Sculpt mouse has much less heft to it compared with the Laser Mouse 7000 (which is one of the reasons I bought the 7000-series) and is not as ergonomic. The top of the Sculpt mouse - where the two main buttons are - feels like cheap slick glossy plastic. I can see the Sculpt mouse easily slipping out of my hand or accidentally being knocked to the floor.  Admittedly I've knocked the 7000 mouse to the hard tile floor several times without a problem; but with the Sculpt mouse I worry that more than 1 drop is going to be a cracked and broken mouse (especially since I can't get the oval bottom back on). Thus a cheap look and feel earns a -1/2 star.CONCLUSIONOverall the Sculpt is a nice looking keyboard and mouse combination.If you're looking for a laptop keyboard feel this is the best setup out there. As I mentioned earlier the key placements are very similar to what you'd find on a 15" or greater laptop keyboard.However the mouse is problematic. It feels cheap. And good luck getting the oval bottom back on once you've got it off; I found it simply too much of a pain.  I've been around computers and mice since the early days of the 5¼ true floppy disk and this oval bottom is really a poor design choice that I hope Microsoft can improve upon.On a mixed note is the separate numpad. If I did dedicated gaming on my PC using the numpad I can see how having this separate would be absolutely wonderful. Still having to go and buy a flat 3V battery is going to be a pain when replacement time comes around.  Word of advice - make sure to take the dead battery with you when you go to the store; as anyone who's bought car fob garage door and other type of replacement batteries knows not all 3V batteries are alike. Thus in my opinion this outweighs the nice touch of a separate numpad.Finally I find that having to buy (or at least have on hand) replacements for 3 different types of batteries for a keyboard and mouse somewhat silly. Why both the keyboard and the mouse at least couldn't have both shared AA or AAA batteries is rather odd. This will just end up adding to your shopping list when buying batteries. For this inconvenience and extra cost alone - 1/2 a star.In summary if I were in need of a keyboard and mouse at 3.5 stars I would at least consider the Sculpt.You can do better though. If nothing else look to the older Microsoft 7000-series mouse and keyboard that are dependable sturdy (so far) and still number one in my view.
5,As the headline says I'm very happy with this mouse/keyboard combo. I'm a software engineer by day and writer in my "off" time so I spend most of my waking hours in front of a keyboard. This combo completely removes any and all strain from your wrists.The battery life is impressive to say the least. In the two years that I've owned this set I've changed the mouse battery once and the keyboard battery never.I don't believe I would choose this combo for gaming purposes (I prefer mechanical keyboards for gaming as well as a gaming mouse that has more programmable buttons). But for work and all other applications this combo is hands down the best mouse/keyboard combo I've ever owned.
5,I never thought I would find a keyboard to replace my old ergonomic MS keyboard...this one is IT!  Sleek design and the keys are quiet...mouse is perfect for hours of use.  Totally worth the investment.
1,Broke on me not even a month after I got it!
5,Excellent keyboard!  Love it!
5,Quirky at first to get used to but really solid. Helps my carpal tunnel out quite a bit. Would definitely recommend. Just takes a little getting used to. :)
1,I don't like it even though the ergonomic is comfortable the manufacturing flaw is really disappointed for these kinds of expensive keyboards.
5,It’s light ergonomic and easy to work with
5,Love the design the separate number pad and the comfortable design of the mouse. I wish however that if something goes wrong with the mouse I believe you may no longer use the rest of it because of the single port it all comes off of. But other than that it’s EXACTLY what I was looking for.
5,Have it for both my office and my home. It will be great if it van use Bluetooth instead of the usb
5,I need an ergonomic keyboard and I have tried several.  It takes getting used to.  The reasons I am (so far 1 day in) in love with this keyboard are (and I have bilateral carpal tunnel and dequervein's tenosinoviits):1.  maintains my writes in a neutral position  (eg not slightly deviated to the outside so there is no "ulnar deviation").  I tried various adjustable keyboards with 2 parts and I have small hands too.  This is fine and less fussing.  "just right"2.  one dongle for 3 pieces3. It is easer to take to work in my knapsack because the keyboard is separated (I go to multiple places and the standard keyboards there fire up my hand problems)4.  It's really easy to type on I make fewer errors with this keyboard because the "action is light"5. the key pad & keyboard has a little button that pulls up the calculator!!! so cool!6.  I have small hands.  I thought the mouse would be too big but it just fine and comfortable to use.  Keeps the heel of the hand off the mousepad and turns out that is good.NOTE FOR NEWCOMERS TO ERGONOMIC KEYBOARDS (and those who are acutely symptomatic):  It takes getting used to if you are a touch typist like me.  it took a few days of general typing and was well worth the time.  Don't try adjusting to this all at once or you could fire up your symptoms.  I
5,I've been using one at work since 2016. Now working at home part time needed to buy my own! Standard keyboards are not for me anymore.
5,This is the best mouse hands down.  The keyboard is nearly as good as the top Logitech but not quite as good. Overall this is an amazing package.
4,great design - but batteries were dead on arrival - very annoying
5,Took a day or so to get used to but this was well worth the switch. I type for 8-12 hours at work and have carpal tunnel in my wrist. Since switching I’ve had almost no flare ups! No wrist or elbow pain. I also type much faster with the split keyboard!Highly highly recommend!
5,I have the same model at work. It was reccomended by my coworker very comfortable. The big mouse feels very good in my hand
5,IF YOU TYPE FOR A LIVING don't wait until the price goes back up!  I've used ergonomic keyboards since they first appeared and am on the computer 8 to 12 hours a day.  This is one of the most comfortable one's I've ever used.  On the downside the keys are just a tad bit smaller than what I was  used to and the function keys are about 1/2 the size of the larger wysiwyg keys.  Thought I would like the 10 key better being detached but that is actually a drawback for my work as I key i numbers a lot!  Mouse is really comfortable.  Took me about 3 days to get comfortable with it typing pretty much non-stop but I liked it so well I got another one for my son to use.
5,Love this product.  Have purchased before.  Had to replace button letters wear off before the keyboard or mouse go bad.
5,I’ve been using a split keyboard since I got carpal tunnel syndrome in 1993 (since cured first with wrist braces and later with better ergonomics). This keyboard is great. I had one for years but after the last time I spilled water on it and it dried the 5 and 6 keys no longer worked. Quite frustrating to proofread and find the 5s and 6s missing! It’s great to have a fully functional keyboard again. I also like having the numerical keypad.With my previous one the numerical keypad stopped working. I found that it needed the battery to be replaced. After that it was good as new.
5,I've used the sculpt keyboard for +4 years. I like the way my hand just rest in the keyboard and stopped the tendinitis crisis that I used to have.I use it on a MAC and have nothing to complain about.
5,I purchased this to replace a previous wired Microsoft keyboard. I am going to review the keyboard and mouse separately.Keyboard ReviewThe keyboard is fantastic and I like how the number pad is separate from the keyboard so that it has a smaller form factor. The keyboard has a support at the front to raise it up to make it easier on your wrists. This works great when I place the keyboard on my lap and makes typing much more comfortable. It and all of the battery compartments are connected via magnets which is awesome because it eliminates the possibility of it breaking off if removed multiple times. I sit 5 to 6 feet away from my computer so having a wireless keyboard that has a good range is important so I am happy to report that it works great at that distance. I highly recommend this keyboard for anyone who wants a wireless keyboard they can use comfortably on their lap and/or anyone who wants a good ergonomic keyboard.Mouse ReviewThe mouse has a blue laser so it is much more sensitive than my previous mouse which is great. However because the battery compartment is connected via magnets it falls off easily when the mouse is dropped. The mouse is a little too round for my taste as it is a bit too small for my hand so about 2/3 of my hand fits on the mouse and the rest has no support when I use the mouse. This causes some discomfort when using it. I believe that anyone who has a hand that is over 6 inches from the base of the palm to tip of the middle finger may experience the same discomfort. If your hand is smaller than 6 inches the mouse may be the right size for you.Amazon Warehouse (Used Product)I purchased this used from Amazon Warehouse and I am very happy with it. It appears as if the previous person took the product out of the package and returned it with little to no use at all. The plastic protectors were still attached to the keyboard and number pad and I don't see any sign of use. If the used product is from Amazon Warehouse and the condition says "Very Good" I highly recommend saving some money by purchasing a used version of the product.
5,O produto não tenho nem o que falar! É sensacional.No começo é difícil de se acostumar a gente vai errar umas teclas para digitar.Mas o conforto é indescritível!Quanto a entrega apesar de estar prevista para dia 10 ou 15 de junho chegou por aqui já no dia 28 de maio!Parabens!
5,El mejor teclado y mouse ergonómico que he probado tengo problemas de tendones en ambas manos y si me ha ayudado bastante principalmente el mouse vale la pena la inversión.El único detalle es que puedes tardar hasta 15 días en acostumbrarte al teclado y al mouse para poder escribir a un ritmo normal.El diseño me parece muy sutil elegante y la verdad muy hermoso.El pequeño teclado numero nunca lo he usado.El mouse nunca puede faltar.Le hace falta un mejor empaque o comprar alguna funda externa para transportar el teclado.Compatible sin ningún problema con Windows (obvio es teclado de Microsoft)No lo he probado con algún otro Sistema Operativo.
5,De las mejores compras que he hecho no estaba seguro por el precio pero es la mejor solución para el dolor de muñeca para los que pasamos todo el día en la computadora. Te tardas un poco en acostumbrarte a la distribución del teclado y mouse pero en menos de un día se resuelve todo.  De haber sabido que la molestia y dolor se quitaría tan rápido me hubiera ahorrado mucho en terapias cremas analgesicos etc. Se los recomiendo. Por ultimo para que el mouse este en la posición correcta necesitan un mouse pad con almoadilla ( yo compre esta Kensington K62402AM Mouse Pad) y la muñeca descansa perfectamente.
4,Este es un reemplazo a un kit de Mouse y teclado que tenía que desafortunadamente derramé varias veces líquido en él y la última ocasión se descompuso. Aún así resistió por lo menos 5 derrames de café. Ahora ya tengo un mug de los que no se voltean y este reemplazo.Error mío no me fijé que no tiene teclado en español. Pero a estas alturas ya me acostumbré a la reconfiguración de acentos ñ etc..Actualmente tienen un costo de 1000 aprox pero por mi urgencia a mi me costo 3000... si me parece algo excesivo por eso le pongo 4 estrellas.
5,El producto es excelente altamente recomendado para trabajar con comidad en la oficina o casala distribucion del teclado es perfecta mas si eres developer :D
5,Excelente artículo el material es excelente y tanto el teclado como el mause son muy cómodos. No tarde en acostumbrarme. Lo solicite en inglés y me llegó en dicho idioma 👍
5,Compré este teclado porque empezaba a sentir dolor en las muñecas. Usar este teclado ha hecho que el dolor desaparezca.
5,Got one for my PC at work and one for my Mac at home.  Very nice to have a uniform keypad and the Mac auto-adapted very nicely.
5,I have not have any pain since I start using this keyboard.  It's been a few months now so I think it works.
4,Este teclado vale la pena. Particularmente si pasarán tiempo considerable frente al computadora tecleando. EL mouse es muy cómodo y el teclado númerico a parte es comodísimo. Algo curioso pero que me encanta es el sonido de la teclas. Es maravilloso.Dicho eso requiere tiempo acostumbrarse pero una vez que uno se acostumbra hasta se vuelve complicado usar un teclado cualquiera pero toma tiempo por eso le doy cuatro estrellas y no cinco.
4,El equipo es frágil específicamente el usb inalámbrico ya que se dobla facilidad y pierde pierde señal con el teclado y mouse.
3,Definitivamente es lo que pedí y aunque mayormente parece nuevo hay varias piezas que vienen desgastadas como si ya hubieran tenido uso.
1,It has started typing multiple letters after few months  can anyone help ?
1,The product is delivered in a defective condition. extremely dissatisfied with the product. The mouse and keyboard was in a terribly bad and used condition
