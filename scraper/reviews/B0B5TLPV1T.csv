5,Great Frame.  Images show up really crisp and clear- they do not get distorted even when adjusting them to switch between a portrait and a landscape layout.  The app is very easy to use and I like that you are able to do bulk uploads.  Another helpful feature of the app is that you can isolate between the various photo gallery albums on your phone  to locate the specific pictures that you want to send to the frame instead of it seeking out all pictures and bunching them together making you scroll through hundreds of pictures like some others digital frame apps do.  I like that you can invite other family members to share your frame so they can also send photos to you.  I've had other brands that caused the pictures to look grainy or didn't show up clearly because they had a glare if the frame wasn't viewed from exactly the right angle but this one is very clear and you can look at it from any point and it still looks great nice and bright even in a sunny room.  It seems to stay connected to my wifi very well it has momentarily dropped the signal but it picked it right back up- and I think that was more of a problem with my network than it was with the frame.  I really like the size which may be large for some but I think it's great to have the pictures so large that you can really enjoy their detail. Another neat feature is that before you send them the app has you choose the most important portion of it so that in either aspect that area of the picture will still show and you can adjust it.  Also after the picture has been sent and is being displayed if you don't like how it shows up you can touch on it and adjust it to change the zoom on it or how it fills the screen. It is very user friendly.  The only feature that I wish it had was different effects as the pictures changed like spinning sliding in bouncing across etc. just to give a little varying interest.  This has no slideshow effect the pictures just scroll to the next one which is fine but that's my only suggestion.  I'm very happy with this. I've had two others of different brands over the years and am most pleased with this one.
5,What a magnificent digital picture frame in a nice size of 15.6 inches. This large digital photo frame with 1920 * 1080 will definitely put your life in color and is so beautiful for family and friends to see.This has all the goodies full HD touchscreen 32GB and with this  WIFI smart frame you can share photos and videos instantly from anywhere via the Aimor app.  This is a great app I have used it before and we have several digital frames around the house in the RV and at our cabin in the mountains.This digital picture frame is a perfect gift idea for your loved ones of all ages such as parents grandparents newlyweds etc. Great for a wedding gift with the pic loaded. If you have not used a digital frame before you are missing out.What a great one to get started or add to our collection like we are doing. This this15.6-inch large digital photo frame is in our front room for all to see our family and especially all our beautiful memories of mom. They will last forever with this super easy to almost plug and play frame
5,This is a wonderful frame and very well priced. We purchased it as a gift for some firends of ours. Once it arrived we downloaded a lot of pictures from different parties and events. We set it up in their home while they were away. They came home to scrolling pictures of our shared events. we explained to them that they could have their children and grandchildren download picture's on their frame remotely. It was a wonderful surprise for them. The seller shipped quickly I think we got it a day early. Very happy with this Money well spent.
5,With a product this big you might be worried about it looking clunky but it actually is very beautiful. The gems around the actual frame add a nice touch to it. It does not have any touch display lag which is really nice. It’s easy to use and only took me about five minutes to set up. The app that you use to transfer the photos is very basic and user-friendly. You can add people to the photo frame so they can add photos themselves. It’s very beautiful and the photos come out very nice
5,I gave it to my parents as a gift. They like it so much because they can see their grandchildren from our home country just by sending from their phone to our digital frame. Easy to operate and add devices. They quality of pictures is amazingly clear. You can have the picture frame in landscape or portait.
5,This is a beautiful addition to my office! And it’s so easy to use! Connect it to Wi-Fi…download the app AiMOR and you can send photos to the frame in a matter of seconds! Not only that…each frame has a unique “share frame code”…anyone with the code can send pictures to the frame with the AiMOR app. Before you send the pics you can adjust how it will appear in the frame (zoom in/out…crop etc). Even after it’s sent…you tap the screen on each pic and adjust it from the frame. (I also think there is a way to send video…but I have not tried it yet.) This would make a great gift for any occasion or anyone.
5,This digital Frame is great! I'm not to tech savvy so I was relieved how easy and quick the set up was! Once the app was downloaded onto my phone I could upload photos to the frame just by sharing them to the app! You can add 32 BG of your favorite photos or 15 second videos in less then a minute!!! Or if you rather upload some now then as time goes on you can add more whenever you like. It's just that easy! And we all need some easy things right now!  I love how you can choose to mount it on your wall or on a small peg. The resolution is perfectly clear and there's a number of different option to make this frame work the best for you! I love mine and I know you will too! Tara O'Connor
5,I got this for my mother and she is not very handing with electronic stuff this however is so simple to set up and start having the family share it! She loves that every day she can go in and see new photos added! Thankyou for making such a great product!
5,Loved that I could bulk load my pictures! Would like the frame to adjust to horizontal or vertical with each picture but other than this I love it! So easy to use
4,Found this item to be to my liking. one complaint wish could play directly off of a flash drive or memory card and not have to load to the frame. but still I really like it.
4,Easy to install. Easy to upload from either a memory chip or iPhone camera.
5,It looks pretty fancy. It's easy to load pictures and it's easy to adjust pictures. It has the time on the screen and the weather on the screen and the date the pictures are taken.
5,The size is great super easy to use with my phone just click on the photos from vacation and now they are on the wall I would recommend to my friends
4,So far this is as advertised. I would buy it again.
5,This digital frame is easy to use the photos are clear and it is a very large screen.We are very happy with this purchase.
5,This is very nice product. It’s got a large screen so you can actually enjoy the photos on it. Would def recommend. It would make a great gift.
5,I love how easy the frame is to use and the size is perfect! I’m always taking pictures of the outdoors and now I get to display them in a beautiful digital frame for all to see. Definitely a fan of this and so happy I found it.
5,I like it no issues. Easy to use the perfect size for an office or house. Lots of space for photos and large screen size.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This frame is fabulous!  It is incredibly user-friendly.  I downloaded the app on my phone and tablet (Androids).  The quality of the pictures is excellent; there are lots of options and functions to select from regarding how your photos display for how long etc.  You can put the stand on so the frame sits upright portrait style or in a landscape fashion.  I love that I'm able to upload my photos from the gallery on my phone or tablet as well as Google photos.  You can "share" the frame with friends and family allowing them to upload photos onto it as well.  Use a USB cable for hardwire uploading from files.  I love the large size!  I absolutely recommend this one!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I literally love this frame. it is beautiful and very big. I downloaded the app and sent 200 pictures from my phone to the frame in less than 30 seconds which is great.The resolution of the frame is great and I love the possibility of also playing videos from my favorite moments. The frame is light and it comes with a sturdy pedestal you can easily mount and use. it also comes with additional screws and the wall mount system in case you want to hang it as a "frame" on the wall.When I uploaded a panting in high resolution I have to be honest is stunning.This is a perfect gift for a wedding or for any occasion really. I would recommend it for sure. You won't be disappointed for sure.
5,This product is awesome and I would recommend to anyone..
5,Love this product so much. Perfect for a gift or to have at your house! 100% recommended
2,Ordered two of these. Excited to buy one for my mother and one for myself since she lives far away. I got mine first. The App works maybe once a day if I’m lucky. I am returning both. As far as pic quality it’s not bad and it is very easy to set up but what’s the point if App doesn’t work????!!!! App says updated which is even more confusing on why it doesn’t work.
1,We thought it would be fun to have our digital frame scroll thru thousands of our photos every day but we found out we could only upload 9 pictures at a time.  A Major Disappointment and to top that off some of them show up on the screen 1/2 or 1/4 of the image.  Do NOT buy this.  On the good point the frame looks better than the typical flat edge frames.My mistake buying some new gadget with few reviews.
5,I order this so we can view the pictures every-time we want it. It's a great buy highly recommended.
5,This is a great gift for someone you love or to have in your home. The picture display is very great and is a nice large size. It is very easy to use and set up. I love being able to view a variety of pictures and it's so easy to add pictures. The touchscreen works great the frame is very nice and the picture quality is wonderful. I want to get one for every household in my family. I highly recommend!
