5,Everything is so cute! I’ve been taking my baby’s monthly pictures and have gotten so many compliments!
5,These are perfect for what I needed.
5,These are very cute! They're double sided so they don't take up much storage space.
5,Cute and simple which is the vibe I was going for! Good for price
5,Great color and size.The material seems sturdy enough. Have used 2x with no issues
5,All parts came out nice!
5,Will update when baby comes
5,Very simple to place anywhere to have in the picture with the baby!
4,Cute item and will do the trick in those early months while baby is so small. These run much smaller than I expected. They are good quality and I like how they are double sided to limit the number of disc to keep track of.
5,I love the elegance and simplicity of the wooden style. The cursive is also a cute touch! Can't wait to keep using these!
4,I have no 9/10 month but two 11/12 months
4,These mile markers were okay. There was nothing wrong with them but I found some that I liked better.
4,Super cute but glad I opened it instead of waiting.. I am missing one and got duplicates of another. Requested an exchange hopefully my next one is correct.
5,I ordered these for fun monthly pictures and they look great! Worth the money!
4,I really liked these then I looked at them again and realized I was given two 7 & 8 month (double-sided) photo cards and missing 5 & 6 month photo card which I will need. Hopefully I will get a replacement or it corrected before I need them. I also noticed some are lighter and some are darker. That doesn’t bother me so much but the lighter ones are harder to see.
5,This sign was bought as a gift so I can't comment yet on how well the pen will work on the wood and whether or not it might smear.However this was a very cute purchase. The wood is thick enough I wasn't worried it might break and it's a decent size also. Very cute. The receivers of this gift loved it and plan to take it to the hospital with them!
5,Perfect for pictures with the little one! Love the colors in this batch!
5,Quality is great and lightweight
5,These are affordable and look good in pics. Ordered them for a baby reveal and will use them throughout the first year. They have one that says “oh baby” and “hello world” so they perfect for a baby reveal and baby’s first pic.
5,Perfect for those who don’t want to do milestone blankets
5,we’re using them right now. so fun!
4,I love the monthly signs but I just went to take my babies picture for month 3 and realized I don’t have a 3/4 month card I have an extra month 5/6. Can you send me a 3/4 month card?
5,It was a last minute purchase before my baby turned 1 month old. Quality of product was expected and no flaws on any of the wooden circles. Overall this item met my expectations if not exceeded.
5,Super cute! Just wish it came in a more reusable-friendly/sturdy packaging like a bag or  or a sturdy box to protect it so I can store it easily for the future or give away later.
3,For the most part great quality for the price. However I am missing the 9 and 10 month one and have 2 3 and 4 month circles disappointing since I wanted one for each month to match.
5,i LOVE these! they’re great for taking memorable photos of those monthly celebrations of your little one. my house is all neutrals and what my son wears is all neutrals as well so this fit really well with the shot. (as seen in my picture had to cover baby’s face due to privacy) i read other reviews about a number or something missing? that wasn’t the case for me i reviewed it as soon as it came and found it in perfect condition. only wish i had order this before my son was born  not until his 2 months celebration ..
3,These are so cute but was disappointed to find two duplicate months (seven/eight) and missing months five and six. I requested a replacement/exchange hopefully all months included in this one.
3,It's a really nice board nice larger size but mine came damaged. I'm bummed because baby is due in a few days. Gotta return it.
3,So I didn’t check every month but now that it’s here I’m missing the 5 and 6 month but have extra 1 and 2 months!! And of course it’s past return window
5,Sturdy and came with a pen.
3,I love these and have kept up with them as my baby got bigger. Now that she is turning 8 months i just noticed I have two of the 9/10 month circles and I do not have an 11/12 month circle. I bought these in Nov so its too late to return. Check your circles to make sure you have all of them!
5,These pieces match with any outfit. You can use them easily and will always have a great outcome! Perfect way to capture special moments!
5,So cute for monthly photo shoots! Great size for babies.
5,Beautiful quality. Will be using for my monthly belly pictures &  milestones once baby is born. Would make a great gift.
4,I love these milestone pieces! The quality and look is great. I did receive (2) 3-4month pieces instead of a 1-2month piece so I was not able to start using them until he was 3 months. I’m sure it was just my luck on that though! I highly recommend!
5,I was super nervous that I would receive duplicates as others mentioned in their reviews but I took my chances and thankfully I didn’t get any! They are the cutest and I got them just in time for my sons 1 month photo. I don’t regret this purchase ❤️
5,Super cute and inexpensive way to get your babies milestone photos!!
3,These wooden disks are very cute and I have lived using them for the first two months of pictures. I noticed today when getting ready to take a few three months pictures of my son that the three and four month disk is missing; there are two five/six month disks instead. That’s pretty frustrating.
5,Could not be happier. I love that they are front and back so they don’t take up too much room. Love the font and the wood. Great durable quality. My toddler has found them a few times and is not soft with anything and these held up!
5,These were exactly what I was looking for! No flaws/imperfections on any of them either. Absolutely no complaints at all!
5,UPDATE: Replacement came and they are perfect!These are adorable… but can’t really be used because I received two 3/4 months and am missing the 5/6 months.
5,The sign was beautiful and well made.
5,I was worried when I first opened these because it looked like some were missing. But they are front and back so no worries. Very cute and sturdy.
5,Love them. Well made cute and perfect for monthly photos.
5,Nice quality.  Made a great gift!
3,These are nice for pictures. I really liked them. Since they are two-sided you have to be careful to keep them in good condition (I.e. if your 5 month old drools all over it you still have to use the same one next month for the 6 month photos). Unfortunately now that I’m at month 11 I’m realizing that I received duplicates of one wooden circle which means I’m missing the 11/12 month circle.. sucks to have to break the picture pattern for the last 2 months after keeping it up for 10 months.. didn’t think to inventory them in the beginning.
5,Great I love them BUT I wish they were more sanded down because if I want baby to hold for picture it can hurt her with the little wood pieces coming out!
5,Love these! The coolest ones I’ve seen on the market yet!
5,These were exactly what I was wanting. I was concerned about duplicates as many reviews say they have them. It was worth the risk and I’m glad I made the purchase.
5,These are awesome no need for a crazy review they work I love them…
2,I purchased this as a baby shower gift. You can't see the writing on them whey they are photographed.
5,10/10
5,Exactly as pictured. Perfect little prop!
3,These are cute but the quality is just so-so. Many of them did not engrave totally - there are wood pieces still left in the words. The six month disc has dark spots on it and the edges were so rough it gave me a splinter. I'll definitely have to sand many of them down before letting a baby near them.
5,Great product. Quality and designs are awesome.
3,I found these average. I ordered 2 sets trying to make a complete set that looked nice but both sets had discs that the writing was not groved out and colored correctly. Ultimately I sent them back and spent more for a nicer set.
5,Are you looking for something simple cute and CHEAP? The price is great and the product is amazing.
5,Used 2 so far and they're so cute! Well made and sturdy!
5,Exactly as advertised! These look exactly like the photos show.  Solid wood cute design they photograph well and are perfect for documenting baby’s growth over the first year.  Great value as many similar products are double the price. Very happy with this purchase!
5,Super trendy and cute
5,These little wooden month by month discs are beautiful! I love the font they are engraved wonderfully and they are sanded and shaped nicely as well. Comes in a nice plastic box. Very happy with this!
2,Two of the discs were the same and had 5 and 6 months and 7 and 8 months on them. We were missing 9 10 11 and 12 months.
5,I was unsure about this purchase as most similar sets are at least twice as much but I am very happy with my decision to purchase these! Beautiful and the quality is amazing! Fast shipping as well received next day!
5,Loved them. Great price compared to other brands. Mine came with all the months. Can’t wait to use them.
5,Other buyers said they got doubles but mine came just fine with one of each that I needed they’re double sided as well can’t wait to take pictures
5,Great product for the reasonable price! I wanted monthly wooden discs to take photos of my newborn baby. There was not many reviews but for the price I chose to purchase anyway. I’m so glad I did! These exceeded my expectations.Also each disc is double sided so you flip the disc for the next month.
5,You get what you see. Very cute and trendy at a great price!
5,Exactly what I pictured and none of the months were missing!
3,Super cute but honestly people really need to pay attention to what is going on these boards because who needs 2 five month boards when I also need a six month one.  I seen multiple people comment on duplicates but come on now.
5,Adorable and good quality 💯
5,Fast delivery! Perfect for those monthly pictures. Had no issues.
5,Love these to take pictures for my son!
5,Th product came as described. The pieces have good quality and are very cute!

5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I am so happy i found these! The quality is amazing! I would definitely purchase again for gifting in the future.
5,So excited for these !!
3,So cute but I received two discs with four and five months and don't have a disc for eleven and twelve. Didn't realize it until past the return window so just be sure to check!
5,Exactly what I was looking for.
5,These are so beautiful and the quality of them is great. Love them!!
5,I looked all over amazon & Etsy for these wooden milestone signs and most sets were $20+. So glad I found these for a reasonable price and they are super cute!
3,Love this set but found that there are duplicate 5/6 month pieces and no 3/4 month piece!  Of course just realized this now that my baby is 3 months and I don't have a piece to take a photo with!  Hoping to be sent a replacement set...
2,Loved these for milestone pictures for baby but was sent a pack that had two 5/6month disc and missing the 7/8. Didn’t realized until I went to take her 7 month pictures and then didn’t have the sign. So disappointed!
5,More cost friendly than a lot of options that I had seen and they look the same as the more expensive versions!
5,Perfect! Exactly what I needed for my milestone pictures and the quality is better than I even expected!
1,Bought this for my baby now that he is 20 months old I realized I did not receive the 10 or 11 months. My return window has closed. Clearly I am not the first person this happened to. Disappointed
5,This product was exactly what I expected and perfect for us!
2,I like the natural wood look of these but unfortunately there was a misprint and we didn’t realize it until setting up the 2 month photo shoot which was then too late to try to return and get a new one so we had to use the misprint for the photo. I recommend checking all your months right when you receive them
3,I unfortunately ordered and received two five/six months and no three/four. Super cute but hoping to get a new one shipped ASAP as she is 3 months in a few days
5,Great purchase
2,The set I received came with two of the “five/six” plaques and is missing an “eight/nine.”
2,The sign was cute but the marker it came with was completely dried out and didn’t work even though it was packaged up!!
5,Perfect.
1,My baby turned 3 months old and I was so excited to take his picture with the 3 month circle I looked and looked and they did not send me a 3 month circle or a 4 month circle but sent me 2 5 months and 6 months…
1,I got months 1-6 then 2 tens 2 elevens and 2 twelves. Now its too late to return them.
2,These disc are cute and are the font that I wanted. However I didn’t receive all of the discs. Very disappointed I won’t be purchasing from buyer in the future.
1,Don’t buy it. It came missing multiple months…
1,Terrible colors. Do not purchase if you are looking for rose pink mauve variations.
1,Good material I loved it was excited to use when I opened it was missing the month piece
1,Missing month two and didn’t realize until my son turned two months..
1,Me llego incompleto faltaban los dos 1
1,We loved how they looked but unfortunately got two of the exact same ones so we don’t have a 7/8 month one instead we have to 5/6 months milestones 🤦🏻‍♀️
1,Check each month disk when you receive your order! We got these and started using them for monthly pictures until we got to month 5 which was badly damaged and unusable.
1,I received wooden monthly milestone cards and I’m missing a lot of the numbers. I’m Very upset I didn’t get to use it.
1,Ordered this product and received missing months and blank months. Sent out for a replacement and the replacement came with the same issues! Getting my money back and would NOT recommend anyone purchase these.
1,I went to pull out this months disc and instead of a 5 and 6 month sign we have two 7 and 8 months. Very disappointed.
1,I’m so upset I opened these days later after receiving threw out box and label only to see that I got doubles and I’m missing month 2 months.
1,These are cute but came missing months 4 and 5.  With something like this you need all the months!
1,Not happy about the missing disk.
1,You can’t not use this product for weekly pregnancy photos as they do not have double 2’s or double 3’s you will miss 22 weeks and 33weeks.
1,Do not buy this product! It was missing half of the set! I only got even months and no hello world sign!
1,I received duplicate months and the one/two month one was missing so I couldn’t even use them. Wouldn’t recommend buying these as it looks like other people had the same problem.
1,Bought this 5 months ago and just notice as I get ready for my daughters 4 month picture. “4 months” is missing! Literally blank. So frustrating.
1,Missing four and five month card but received a double three and four month card.
1,Do not buy!! There only 7 plaques not 12. Very disappointing.
1,Missing month 7. Instead have a duplicate
1,I received two five/six month wooden pieces and the three/four month piece was left out. Very upset because I’ll now have to order a new set before my babies 3 month picture.
1,Pen had inside pieces missing so I couldn’t write on board
1,My daughter turns 1 month on 8/29. Opened my package just to see I don’t have the one/two card…I have two of the three/four.
1,Is this a joke?!? It arrived with like 5 of the months missing ! Unbelievable
1,Super disappointed with these. They came with duplicate months and some months missing.
1,
1,Super cute but missing month 5. Really? Quality control fail.
1,My package came and only had 5 months included inside??
1,The media could not be loaded.
1,I want my money back!! Received repeated pieces. Couldn’t take my baby’s photo as I wanted. Waste of money !
1,Came missing the two-three month piece
2,I received duplicates and not a 3/4 month one and didn’t realize until I’ve already started taking monthly photos
1,Would NOT recommend purchasing. I received these milestones as a baby shower gift and I went to use them when my baby turned one month and I couldn’t because the one month was missing along with 7-8 other months. I am very disappointed.
5,Everything came as described I was nervous when reading reviews of some getting duplicates but I didn’t end up with that problem!
5,They’re simple and cute. Match with any background or outfit
5,First I thought I was shorted but then I realized they were double sided. Super cute and affordable. Would definitely recommend.
5,I am very happy with the quality and look of these monthly milestone markers. They are very cute and make a great prop for photos!
5,I was a little nervous to order these after reading so many reviews where people receive missing and/or duplicate months but I figured hey I'll give it a try since it's so easy to return things from Amazon. My set was normal and complete and it's super cute! These were a fraction of the price that I've seen similar ones go for elsewhere and the quality is on point.
5,These are so cute! I highly recommend
5,I needed something to pop for my baby’s milestone pictures and I had seen these everywhere but definitely for such a higher price I’m happy with my purchase!
4,I was definitely very surprised by the size of this! I anticipated it being a maximum of about 4 inches wide but it’s actually about a foot long 😂 looking forward to using this anyway!
5,
5,Little wooden signs that are perfect for baby milestone pics. I only wish there was one for the name weight and height but not a big deal. Priced great for the quality would give as a gift too!
5,These make monthly milestone pictures awesome!
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Some of the wood is chipped/ forming bubbles. The sharpie does not work it dried out. So I had to use my own sharpie. Overall cute item and very big.
5,I was nervous to order these because on some bad reviews but I definitely don’t regret it! They are perfect!!! I love them!  Exactly how I pictured and has every month! Go order now!!
5,Good quality for the price! Double check and make sure you get all pieces. They’re front and back. Mine came with everything!
5,Bought this off a baby registry  and they loved it!
4,The first set I received had double milestone pieces and missing months. I exchanged for a new one and the second was accurate and I received the following day. It is exactly what I was looking for but make sure you have the proper months before your return window expires just in case!
5,Adorable and inexpensive
5,Beautiful milestone plaques! Was anxious that some may be missing but received everything! Can't wait to use them!
1,I just went to take my sons 2 month picture and I noticed a defect. There is no 2 month disc. The one month disc is blank on the other side. So disappointed
5,Such a good quality and nice print
5,Me encanto me llego tal cual se ve en las imagines muy bonitos... ¡se los recomiendo!
1,Un disque est arrivé endommagé et tâché. La qualité est mauvaise pour le prix.Impossible de contacter le vendeur pour trouver une solution malheureusement.
1,This sign is quite large which is fine but not what I was really expecting. The lettering is not crisp (garbled edges) and is faded in some spots. I fixed the lettering myself rather than returning it but I would not recommend it to anyone else.
4,All tiles arrived! Unfortunately one of them has some noticeable black spots on it. We are going to sand it a little and it should easily come off.
5,I am going to use these for my daughters monthly milestones they are really cute and nicely made.
5,Very happy with the quality colour and font
3,It is nice . It did have mould on it I had to wipe it off the letters. Very odd.But once wiped it was nice. But it’s HUGE . I was looking for a small sign by the baby at the hospital. This will be the same size as the baby. Haha we had a laugh over it.
3,Me gustaron mucho lucen exactamente igual a las imágenes mi único problema es q uno de los discos se repite (el mes 11 y 12) por lo q me falta un disco con los meses 7 y 8 por la fecha no alcanzo a devolverlos y que me lleguen a tiempo para el primer mes de mi niña. Supongo no tendrá foto con esos meses lo cual si me decepciona un poco.
