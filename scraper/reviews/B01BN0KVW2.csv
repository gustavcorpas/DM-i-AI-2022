5,Great ink. Super expensive. Just like a lot of printers HP won't let u print anything even just in black if ur yellows aren't full. Makes sense to me???
4,Good replacement on my Pagewide 452dn.I really like that printer and that these cartridges cost a lot less than the same capacity in traditional inkjet and moderately less than color laser toner.But I dislike that HP has done their usual thing with consuming a whole lot of color ink when printing grayscale (which uses color ink) or even B&W (to keep the color heads "charged" apparently). For almost never printing color I go through a lot of color ink... Love the printer but hmmmm.

5,The HP PageWide printers look a lot like Laserjet multifunction printers but use ink instead of toner. Unlike a regular inkjet the print head is the full width of the page (thus PageWide). These A-series cartridges are the normal capacity versions. These provide about 1/3 more pages than the closest match in the Laserjet line at about the same price. A definite advantage in terms of total cost of ownership.With inkjet technology like the PageWide printers getting a smaller capacity cartridge might be a better choice with lower print volume as ink can dry out given enough time. This is unlike with Laser printers where getting the high capacity cartridge is usually a better value even with low print volume.Our color printing is a small proportion of our overall printing so getting standard size cartridges in the colors makes sense for us. If your color volume is higher you may want to consider the 972X cartridges.The physical size of the PageWide cartridges is smaller than an old fashioned VCR tape. Much smaller than the equivalent a laser cartridge. This the same as the ones included with the printer. Installation is both easier and cleaner than a toner cartridge.I like this PageWide ink technology a lot with its excellent quality ease of use and lower price per page than laser. So far no problems or issues. I think it's definitely 5 stars.
5,Shipped quickly and affordable price
