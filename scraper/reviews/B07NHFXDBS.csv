5,So I should wait to review for when I actually use this machine.  So far I have just done a test run.  I had to read the instructions to figure it out.  I love that it plays DVDs.  My test run was done in my brightly lit kitchen (it was daylight) and I still got a good picture on the wall.  It was easy to focus for a nice picture and I was surprised at how good the sound/volume was for it.  I really like this machine so far and am really excited to have my first projector!
5,I once bought a tv with a DVD player installed to it. This was like the next best thing. I'm pretty much sold on the idea that this could be the only projector I'm going to ever need. My next move is going to probably be to store it away and go on and buy that big screen tv I've always wanted.
4,The picture quality was very good. Instructions were a little confusing because there were extra options.
4,Not easy to operate

4,It did what I needed it to do. It was a little better than some of the reviews I read.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Used this for the first time yesterday and love it! I do recommend using a Bluetooth speaker in addition to the one built into the projector because the speaker is not very loud and the fan is a little louder than I’d hoped but the price on this unit to me is well worth it just so happy to finally view my DVD’s in my room and whenever I want to ( I rent a room and there just isn’t space for tv and all that). It’s a nice small projector yet it projects a fairly large screen onto my wall. I’m so impressed with it and very pleased with my purchase.
