3,Ok I read the reviews before I got this but I still decided to get because 1. I love the rose gold 🤩color&2. I wanted my AirPods Pro protected from dust n dirt etc. 🤔🤔because I daily try to clean n wipe off any dust n dirt particles from the case. 😷😷The bottom piece was actually pretty easy to place. It was done in a few seconds to be honest. The top part however took a few minutes. Because of the magnet it was constantly being pulled down wen it wasn’t even aligned properly. At first I thought I got it perfect but then when I put my earbuds in & tried closing the top felt like it got caught a lil on the earbuds & like it was slightly scratching the edge of earbuds.😱🥴 It felt like if I didn’t correct it then soon my earbuds would be marked or scratched slightly. So I had to remove it. ( it was just the top part of the dust guard) I took my time to carefully remove it. I reattached the guide sticker & slowly peeled it away from my case & it didn’t break. Then I tried to realign it better. It no longer slightly catches on the earbuds so that was improved but it is slightly raised up in a spot. 🤨🤯Like a bubble. But I’m afraid if I try to peel it away again that it’ll either break or I won’t get it to align better. It’s actually not worth the money. It’s EXTREMELY flimsy it’s thin & looks & feels like it’ll shatter if you accidentally drop your case. I think they either should have made the metal slightly thicker - more sturdy than it is. Or use a different material. Maybe a thin gel a gel would’ve been a better material to use. Because if you didn’t get it to align perfectly then you don’t have to worry about your earbuds being scratched up or damaged.Some pros are the rose gold color is gorgeous. When you open up your case it really is cute. But it doesn’t look any more luxurious it’s just pretty. They could’ve put more of a design on it or something. It honestly could’ve been made by a sturdier metal. There is a thing called thin steel. I just think it would’ve been wayyyyy better if they went that route of the gel option. This honestly should’ve been $1. & no more. I’m sure they made it for just a couple of cents. Probably less than $.25 THATS how flimsy it is. 🤬😤🤬😶Really not worth the money& if you gotta pay for shipping lmfaoo then that’s just highway robbery. T.G I got prime. So it was free shipping. I think if I had to pay for shipping on top of the ridiculous price I’d cry & id cuss them out & ask for my money back. 🤬😡🤬Also there’s no reason why the application process gotta be this complex could be easier!😤 the dust guard kept lifting up when I was taking off the cover on them. If anything maybe they should’ve split each guard in 2 might’ve been easier to apply that way. I’m so mad it’s so flimsy actually.Lol 🤐🤫 I just realized the only pro I listed was that it was pretty another pro- the bottom guard was the easiest to attach. That’s it. It was mostly cons. So be warned lol. If you do decide to purchase this then Take your time applying both guards. The guide sticker isn’t very sticky either nor is the actual dust guard. That’s another thing- they need to add a bit more adhesive. 🥺I suspect that this will not last for more than a week or 2 but i shall update you guys on the longevity of the product. 💗💗~UPDATE ~—>>It’s been a few months now since I got the dust guard. & I’m still surprised that it surpassed a few weeks Lolol. But I’m not rough with it I’m careful w/ my tech. I’ve only dropped my phone twice last year. Luv my tech. I’ve been using my AirPods much more these past few months because of COVID(I’m in NYC I hope everyone keeps safe. Positive wishes to anyone that reads this) so I’ve put the dust guard through good use. Constantly opening & closing my AirPod case. The shine of the rose gold color is still vibrant like the 1st day I opened it. There’s still that annoying small bubble on the top dust guard from me readjusting it. But I tend not to look at it so that I don’t have the urge to readjust it again cus I might end up making it worse or tearing it. So after thorough use I can add a few more pros. It’s so far long lasting. The color is still a beautifully vibrant rose gold. It actually does protect my AirPods from dust & lil crumbs or whatever. Again I still think the price NEEDS TO BE LOWER. Way too much for it. But other than that. It’s ok.2nd UPDATE—-> the vibrancy if the rose gold color has now deteriorated some. It’s almost like a patina as if it was copper. Which would make sense. Like I said before it was most likely very cheaply made I doubt they would use actual rose gold. Plenty of people substitute rose gold for copper. So it’s not unreasonable that they chose to go that route. Plenty of ppl luv the aging of copper/ the patina that develops after awhile. But I would’ve rather liked it to actually stay the vibrant rose gold. But a good thing is that it took a few months for this to develop. Didn’t happen right away. Actually I just noticed it a few weeks ago. I still kinda regret buying it still not worth the price. Like AT ALL. You can easily just clean n wipe down I have to do that anyway even with the guard. This will be the final update.
3,So i got the product pretty fast. Its a simple concept but it feels like i got a defect. So first the instructions are a little unclear but easy enough to figure out on ur own. But while looking at the instructions the protection sticker was put upside down so i had to unstick it and rotate it to make it work. The sticker for the bottom of the case was a perfect fit and i had no issue putting it on but for the top half o had a lot of trouble. Since i had to rotate the sticker it lost some adhesive to help put it on so i had to do it by hand which was annoying but no matter how many times i tried it never got centered properly. I spent around 20 minutes on this because if these issues. Its still off centered so i came to the conclusion that it might not be an accurate size for the air pods. Price point isnt terrible but id rate it as a $5 dollar item not $10.
4,The product is good it's just tricky to install. You have to be patient to install and make it work. If you don't align it correctly it can scratch your AirPods it happened to me. I have to order a second one to install it properly. The product does the job to keep your AirPods case clean and away from scratches.
3,First let me say that I do like the look of these shields/gaskets. The finish does hold fingerprints but they can be wiped of fairly easily with some care. I think that with some tweaks in execution of the product it would be great but as of right now is average at best.When I bought these I thought they seemed a bit pricey but I was banking on elago’s reputation for a durable well made product.My first disappointment was in the installation instructions. There basically weren’t any. There was a small folded piece of instructions that mentioned nothing about surface prep or tips and tricks. Also the actual instructions were lacking except to say that alignment of film/shields was extremely important.If the success of these dust shields hinges on alignment so much you would think that Elago would have engineered a way for these shields to be aligned easily when they were being placed but that is not the case. Both shields came on one sheet of clear plastic with another protecting the adhesive side. Meaning to mount one gasket you had to expose the adhesive for both gaskets. Not a great start. Each should be on its own sheet.Next you would think that with the odd shape of the bottom of the AirPods case and the hinge and lid being in the way of seeing clearly they could die cut the plastic sheet to fit around the hinge for help with placement and also place some registration marks for alignment. Same for the top or lid of the case. Especially because as seen in the pictures the shields/gaskets are so very thin in some spots that you don’t want to have to pull the shield back off because of misalignment and risk it breaking.Most people don’t have a stand to clamp the case in and will be trying to install these with one hand. Which makes alignment of the shield that much harder.The shield for my lid was misaligned just slightly and when I tried to pull it back the shield snapped in one spot. Also if it is not aligned correctly your finger or fingernail will drag across the thin edge of the shield causing more problems over time.As I said I love the look of the product and think these could be worth the price if Elago had taken the time to engineer the process of preparing the surface and installing the shields to a higher degree.  If they address these issues then I could see recommending the product to others. As of right now that’s not the case.
3,This was very difficult to install and because it is metal it sticks to the case as you are trying to install it.  This leads to you having to pull the adhesive backed dust guard off multiple times.  I do wound care and have pretty steady hands and still this was difficult while following the instructions and with tweezers.  It was just plain difficult and on top of that once you get it the thing hardly lines up perfectly either so you have metal edges even if ever so slight bordering the interior of the case which leads to it scraping against the AirPods and leaving a mark on my new foam ear tips.  The AirPods also don’t slide in and out like they used to.  Sucks because I wanted to I’ve this product but I think due to that it’s not very good.  On that note it does seem to keep debris from going inside as much as before which is the point so I am continuing to suck it up.  I think to improve this product they should include at least two of each side so if and when you mess up you can use the other one.  I’m sure it would cost them not that much more and they can just charge us a little more.  We would appreciate it because otherwise it either works or it doesn’t and if it doesn’t you feel cheated and you won’t want to order another one.  If it already came with two pairs it would make more sense.  Sort of like how they do with screen protectors.  If you have fat fingers don’t even try to install this because you will just be frustrated.  Give it to the most anal retentive and perfectionist person in the house and see how they do.  That person in my house is me and it was very challenging to get installed properly.  Not sure if I am going to keep it in there or request a refund or replacement.  I hate leaving a bad review but as it stands I can’t recommend this to others.  Not unless they fix those things.
5,Before I continue read that title again. And then again. I want to emphasize that THIS INSTALLATION WILL REQUIRE TIME AND FOCUS as well as a STEADY HAND in order to install properly. I’d be willing to bet most if not all negative reviews here were missing at least one of those. If you have difficulties properly installing screen protectors this is going to be impossible for you. If you rush throwing this on it is going to look like trash. TAKE. YOUR. TIME. The result is worth it in the end. You have to be very particular with the way you handle these stickers; think of it like a piece of sticky aluminum. If you are too rough bend it the wrong way rip it off the plastic like some kind of wild animal… you are going to mess it up or tear it altogether. I had to harness my inner monk in order to properly align and place these things. The cut of the stickers is so precise and the space you’re placing them is so tiny that there is little margin for error here. It must be placed perfectly or there will be overhang.I know this all sounds very intense but I must emphasize the difficulty here so that future buyers know exactly what they’re getting in to and don’t go blaming the product and leaving bad reviews because they were sloppy or incapable. This product is getting five stars from me because regardless of difficulty it does exactly what it intends to do. And *dang* does it look sharp once properly installed. I’m less worried about dust now while also thrilled by the sheer appearance of it. I will update this review if durability lacks over time (I literally got these on maybe ten minutes ago).If you are willing to take at least fifteen to thirty minutes to sit down and really take your time with these I have no doubt that you will be able to get them on no problem. If you are impatient lacking in coordination or have big clumsy hands get someone to assist you or look elsewhere for dust protection.
3,One side ripped coming off adhesive. Other side installed fine does what it’s suppose to for now. For the price I can’t complain too much but still unfortunate.
3,It took me alot of patience to put this thing on. The instructions are unclear or I'm just dumb. And when I was trying to grab my airpod my finger got caught on the metal plating and I started lifting it up with the airpod. It went right though my finger and gave me a pretty nasty cut. It's an alright product but you need to he safe around it lmao. It's not a sticker or nothing like that it's just a magnetic piece of metal that you have to fit on
4,it works really well to keep my airpods clean and it feels like it’s not even there but after a little bit of use some of the dust shield broke off.
5,At the time of this review there’s really only these and one other cheaper brand to buy if you want a dust guard.Trust me spend the extra couple dollars and get these because the quality is 1000% better.All I can say is two words: user errorThe only reason I can think someone would review this product poorly is if they thought a super thin piece of metal thin enough to fit in your case but not make the lid gap up at all would somehow be super strong and not require you to be careful as you put it on.Literally just be gentle as you apply it and you’re fine! :)Pro tip: get it wet on the sticky part before you stick it on the case. This will allow you to slide it around a little to get it positioned just perfect. Then just let it sit and dry and the adhesion will keep it in place once dry.You’re not working with a lot of space when you apply it so the challenge I think people face is it’s placed just barely off where the metal is hanging over the hole just slightly. - the metal is cut the right shape perfectly so it definitely can be slid into the right position I think ppl just apply it ever so slightly off and it’ll kinda grip and make removing the pods more difficult. - then they try to take it off to fix it and accidentally rip it. - Get it wet first and that won’t happen 👍🏽In summary: be careful and pay attention to what you're doing and you’re fine. The product isn’t cheaply made at all. It’s just a thin piece of metal.Everything about this product is exactly what you’d hope it to be.Bonus quality: the metal in the dust guard is magnetized by the magnets already in the case (science!) so with this it actually helps add extra magnetic force to help hold the case closed just a little better. - not a lot but enough to be slightly noticeable
3,Day one install the dust guard the top guard thin layer peeled off. It’s very thin layer. Installation is not so easy. I don’t know how many people will successfully install at first time. Replacement requested and will test the guarding from dust part in phase two.
5,Wow what a cool product! I had recently lost my AirPods 1st gen and thought that after 2 years of ownership I would upgrade to the AirPods Pro. Obviously they aren’t cheap so I really wanted to do a good job protecting them. I started off by buying a case which happened to be an Elago case. It looked great but I opened up the charging case and saw that the inside was dirty. It was always like this on my old AirPods and I wanted to protect my new AirPods from this before it was too late. After some research and watching some reviews I was led to this product. This dust protector if you can get it on “properly” not only looks FANTASTIC but it also more importantly protects your case inside from scratches from particles attracted to magnets in the actual internal part of the AirPods. I have installed a fair share of screen protectors on iPhones and even an Apple Watch screen protector but I would say this was a different level of anxiety and difficulty. To start with the protector itself is a very small delicate piece that is difficult to put on the AirPods but the problem becomes worse when you look at the directions and they are pretty much no help to you. When I peeled of the protection layer to get to the guards I accidentally peeled too quickly and lifted a small piece of the guard off of the adhesive and thought I had ripped or stretched it. After a little panicking that I had ripped it I was able to fix it. If you are worried about the installation process you should not let that deter you from buying it though as Elago has a video installation guide on YouTube going into much more depth for the install process. Overall I am extremely happy with my purchase and I think you would be too. With the dust guard and a really unique case (also from Elago) I am completely ready to start carrying my AirPods with me!
2,This is my second one. First one I BARELY got on aligned well enough NOT to tear. But eventually it tore. Once a tiny piece is torn you should take the rest off it's razor sharp metal and will cut you. Second time after a month of having no dust guard I wanted it again because it DOES work but man... install on this one went a little better but the top section broke (no clue how install went smooth) but you can't tell if it's aligned perfect OR if it overhangs the ear bud holes so you're basically hoping you have it right then you remove the clear backer used to install and see that oops it overhangs a hair and is now a razor sharp edge that slices your finger or you tear it more with each use... just not worth the money...
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 As you can see it is true rose gold color! Wonderful right? I haven’t even had this case very long and those black smudges started showing up.. it’s almost a metallic dust guard with double sided sticky tape. Not problem. But the black smudges won’t come off and I don’t know where they came from I usually use my fingers or a tidies every now and again to wipe it off to be gentle with it but it’s now kinda bothering me that those smudges are there. Starting to wonder how long it’ll take for it to turn all black 🤷🏼‍♀️ So for now it’ll work. I mean it is doing it’s job I guess
4,It’s not a bad product. I want to give a fair as possible review. I may have done something incorrect in the application process.I tried to correct and reapply and as you see from my picture it tore. My only complaint is- it should have 4 strips instead of the two it comes with.
3,Case is good enough without this. Good for show
2,Within 5 minutes of putting this sticker on with the included instructions I noticed this piece on the right side. I had barely even touched it beyond placing the sticker on the case. I’m pretty disappointed with the experience I had. Maybe mine was defective? Either way I gave it an extra star because if it had actually stayed in it looked so nice. Even with the flapping bit there I got compliments as soon as I put it on there.
1,I love Elago and have bought countless products over the past decade from them. They always impress me with their design quality and especially the unique challenges their products solve. But... this. product. sucks.I have bought two over this past week. First time I looked at the very minimal instructions on how to apply the stickers and was genuinely baffled. The instructions do not adequately describe the confounding nature of transferring stickers from one sheet to another (why?) before applying them to the case.After realizing how delicate the stickers were and the precision needed to apply them correctly I watched several videos and read several posts about the installation. Knowing how to apply the stickers and what the outcome should be I was still wary of trying to apply them.I spent an hour doing exactly as the instructions videos and posts instructed but the stickers are thin brittle and unforgiving. You need the steady hands of a surgeon to apply them correctly or else they will be ruined. There is no guide to place them correctly and the irregular shape of the case holes and sticker make it almost impossible. One nanometer off in any direction and the sticker will occlude the airpod holes leaving a sharp metal blade that will cut your finger scrape your airpods etc. After many failed attempts I eventually was left trying to apply the sticker with no backing manually which led to tearing and rage.Ordered another. A tipster mentioned he had luck cutting around the sticker on the sheet and then applying. My second experience was much more cautious than the first but ended in the same way... a lot of effort a lot of frustration a thousand tries to place the sticker correctly and ending with a torn sticker.I give up. I'll take the dust...  I have no doubt the product itself is great but the application process is not worth the time effort or frustration - even if this was free. The only way this could work properly is if the product came with a guide shaped to the holes in the case with the sticker around it. Then you could lower the guide into the holes apply the sticker and remove the guide.
2,When I first saw this product I was very excited to put it on my new air pod pros. I previously owned the 2nd gen AirPods and they collected a great amount of dust and metallic powder. When I saw this product I thought it would be a solid bit of thin metal. When I received the 9 dollar product and opened it I saw that it was just glorified tin foil with very strong adhesive on the back and if you barely misaligned it while installing it was trash because you lift it back up and put it back on without it ripping. Had to throw it away. All in all it was a great idea and strong adhesive so if installed right it definitely will not fall off but it’s very tricky.
3,They scratch them and it cuts u
3,The product would work great if it wasn’t so easy to break.. I followed the instructions on how to put the product on very carefully. I closed the case and opened it and it was fine. The case doesn’t fully close but that was fine. When I took my AirPods out the dust guard scraped the AirPod and broke. The only one that I have on is the top one now but I feel like it is worth the money as the product would work as intended but you just have to be extra careful while applying it. I’ve read several reviews saying don’t buy it because it broke while putting it on. Those people either didn’t have the patience to put the dust guard on or weren’t doing it correctly. I’d definitely buy it again and be extra careful and double check while applying to make sure it is put on perfectly.
2,I had the gold version of this on my OG AirPods (that I installed before they started adding the helper sticker) & it was great! But! The shape of this design for the AirPods Pro is terrible. The edges are so narrow and thin that it’s impractically nondurable. Taking my ear buds in & out of the case ~5 times tore the bottom and deformed the top. Total waste of money! It’s a real shame because I liked the design used for the OG AirPods a lot 😢
2,TL;DR: this will cut you if it starts to disintegrate and you try to pull it off with your fingers.This cover was cute (and moderately difficult to install--use the video!) It does its job if I'd reviewed this in February after I first got them I'd likely have given a 5* rating. But now that it's been about eight-ish months I've experienced three problems:1. I had the rose gold color which turned absolutely tarnished and black in about four months. I can deal with that though no one really looks at it but me.2. After it tarnished the tiny pieces near the long edges started to flake off. Again could handle that as it seemed at the time cosmetic. Looking at other reviews I'm glad none of the tiny pieces clung to my airpod and cut my ear. I can absolutely see how that happened.3. Is the awful one. Having had enough I decided to try to pull it off but due to the magnet the case was trying to hold on to the dust cover-- which is RAZOR sharp. I cut my finger pretty badly on the dust cover trying to remove it.I don't usually write reviews but people need to know that it will absolutely cut you! Lesson learned: Use tweezers or small pliers to get it off when it starts to disintegrate... There's probably instructions or a video somewhere that will tell you how sharp it is and don't touch it but it's too late for me.
2,TL;DR it doesn’t stick well breaks easily doesn’t prevent dust and can be dangerous. Find a different product or save your money.This product is supposed to be a dust cover but it sits lower than the rim and won’t prevent dust or metal material from entering the case. I bought this product for the aesthetics but if you are looking for a dust cover that look elsewhere or take the minute or two to wipe off the inside of your case.The installation was very difficult because the product did not come with adequate information and the packaging did not direct me to the online instructional video.The adhesive is very weak and the product is very thin. The combination of these two flaws has left me with a rip underneath my left hinge and with small cuts on my fingers from the installation.I will use this product for a week and see if it was worth the $10 for the aesthetics otherwise I will try to find a way to get my money back.
3,I love the look it gives my pods but I gotta say.. I tried 3 times and on the 3rd try decided to leave it because the adhesive might wear off. There is some edge no matter what I did that would hang over the edge of the corner (of the inside divets in the charging case). So if it’s hanging over on the front top; it catches on the AirPods and eventually would get worn off. I guess it might just be user error.. but I’m usually pretty good at this kind of thing.
1,UPDATE:After only a few weeks I noticed that one of the guards tore at a narrow point. No idea when or how this happened but since I use my AirPods sparingly and carefully I can only attribute this to a flawed product. But because of the tear it exposed a sharp edge that risks minor injury - therefore I had to remove them. Considering how carefully I installed them I consider these guards to be flawed and potentially hazardous. Too bad I really wanted to like them.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I was skeptical of this product just because of the mixed reviews. If I can sum them up including my experience here goes: the product works really well but they're a pain to apply properly.The package arrived as only a small box. Inside the box was only a cardboard sleeve with two attached plastic sheets: one with the dust guards and the other a guide sticker. Oddly the guide sticker and the back of the cardboard sleeve both have instructions on them but they are not the same (the former has three steps whereas the latter has four). Neither set of instructions are helpful at all because they both fail to mention removing the plastic covering over both the dust guards and guide sticker before applying (essentially each consists of two plastic sheets stuck to each other).My suggestion is to watch the video it is a revelation. Even after watching they are still a bit hard to apply because of the precision needed given they are precisely cut metal and any misalignment is likely to cut you or your AirPods by accident. If you take your time and really focus on the edges you can to both sides in a few minutes.For the future I wish the manufacturer would print in bold (maybe red) lettering on the plastic sheets that need to be discarded before proceeding with the application process and which side of the guide sticker is the "sticky" side. The instructions should also have a link or QR code to the video.
3,I was excited to receive this product because I wanted to keep my new airpods case as clean as it could be. I put this product on and for the first week it was awesome. Then the second week came along and parts of the product ripped off and got broken so now I have an incomplete covering on my airpods case. Overall a 5/10 but if it was more durable then definitely a 10/10. The product isn’t bad by any means it just doesn’t have that long-term solution I personally was looking for.
3,Current user of Elago cases on my AirPods. Upgraded to AirPods Pro and started looking for cases. Found this item while browsing cases and figured I would give it a try since my last pair had black scratches that I couldn't get rid of from collecting magnetic materials from my pockets while at the beach etc and getting crushed mashed into the white plastic when the lid is closed. Just installed them and as you can see in the picture they closely align to the AirPods holes but when closed it causes a gap between the upper and lower parts of the charging case. Eyeballed it with a magnifying glass and it doesn't look like it is impeding the hinge but their thickness is causing them to touch each other preventing the charging case from closing completely. Debating on whether to peel them off and return them or to see if it seems to be a problem. However disappointed that doesn't "close perfectly".
2,I usually don’t write reviews. I’ll start with my experience. I have repaired cellphones and electronics since I can remember and I have a very high attention to detail. From the start the alignment is nearly impossible to line up. The quality of the metal seems ok for how thin it is. It definitely makes the case look cool. For 2 weeks. Then it begins to dimple from dust and whatever other stuff is in your pockets. Then it breaks. I’ve had small pieces break off and I should’ve just taken it off then. That was 3 months ago. Just today I went to put the AirPods away and the lip of the broken section caught my finger sliced and then inserted itself deep into my finger. I watched it happen. I wish I would have taken a picture of my finger before I cleaned it up. It might keep a LITTLE dust out but I think the silicone case does better at that. I can’t really recommend it to whoever is looking for recommendations because I was using it as intended and it broke under normal use and THEN sliced me open. Like I said I don’t write reviews but felt like I had to today. It’s more of a novelty item.
3,It does what it’s meant for it doesn’t let your AirPods case get dirty for the bits of magnet. I use my AirPods everyday so it’s nice to have something protecting my case from dirt and bits of magnet that the case picks up. But after having it on for two good weeks the durability of the thin pieces of chrome I believe it started to break on its own.(It’s true from what you can see on the other reviews!!!)
3,The stickers are so fragile and thin impossible to apply. When you finally can do they are metallic and brittle they do break in chunks here and there. Useless IMO.
5,Does as advertised makes it easier to clean debris from the crevices of the AirPods. Decent protection and for the low price you really can’t beat it.
3,It was good for a while then peeled off after a month
2,It is almost impossible to get the upper and lower pieces to fit exactly. Even with following the install video perfectly I had great difficulty getting the pieces centered and if not perfect it is not a simple task as smoothing it out. One side was a fraction off and it caused my AirPods to rub and when I took them out today it ripped the liner. Over all it makes the aesthetic of the case look much nicer and a neat way to customize but over all I would not purchase it again.  Just as an example if you have ever had trouble getting a phone screen protector to sit perfectly this has even less forgiveness to make mistakes. But if you are good at stuff like this it definitely makes the case look sleek.
5,This item is a very thin piece of metal. It was very easy to install using the guide sticker(both applied in less than 2mins total. The adhesive doesn’t seem strong at all. I’d recommend using alcohol to clean case before applying this dust blocker(no wipes are included with this kit to insure best adhesion. Product arrived today so I can’t comment as to its durability as of yet. As long as the adhesive maintains I see no possible issues. It does create a small gap. However when using a case cover this gap is not noticeable.
2,wouldn’t stay on case
3,Stickers must be applied 100% perfectly or else any tiny misalignment will cause lid of case to not close properly. Also the color fades at connecting areas of case rather quickly. Did not last as long as i would have liked them too. Will go with a vinyl/silicon option next time.
2,The product is indeed a good idea but this product did not meet my expectations. I really don’t write much negative reviews but this product was really frustrating. It is hard to align properly that is mostly due to my tendency to make things too perfect but the product gives you a warning that if not properly aligned the dust guard will scratch your AirPods when you take them in and out of the case. With that information in my head I tried to get as perfect as possible. Once I got it on the lid would not close all the way which really bugged me I then attempted to remove them and there is really no safe way to remove them without ripping them apart so it was a waste of time and money for me. The edges of the sticker are rather sharp while I was trying to remove it it cut into my finger nail so if I made the wrong move it most likely would have gave me a thin cut on my finger. Product needs major improvements.
2,It didn’t line up at all! I had to basically cut it in half and cut it up just to line up the bottom.
3,Not for me.
2,While I love the “guide stickers” this fell apart in just a few days and the guide sticker doesn’t really allow for the most precise placement which you kinda need. Overall I don’t think this is worth the money.
2,Bro i was playing siege and it was a 4v4 then slowly my teamates started dying off shot in the head breach charge fuze and once i was left it was a 1v4 and i had to clutch but there was one problem… i was almost out of ammo. So i basically had to use my impacts and lesions to go use and got 2 down with those and afterwards used the last bit of my ammo to kill 1 opponent but still had 1 left and i thought what if he were to be down to knife fight? And so i attempted to let him know that i had no ammo and eventuallt he caught on and so he approached me flash in hand. Me thinking he was going to cooperate i knife and he knifes me back killing me i am so mad. Also the product was okay peeled off many times but did its job for 2 months then i got tired of it and threw it away.
5,*UPDATE* Not only did they send one they were apologetic and sent me TWO  even though it was a bad install ( on my part ) I still love it. If you buy it just watch the video it’s worth it. I love it. Thank you guys soo much I really appreciate itOLD*(I would like to post a picture but it’s not even on. Very vague instructions the adhesive side didn’t stick and the thin part ripped on me during install because some part sticked but most stayed on the guide paper.)
4,The product is difficult to install. But it does keep the dust out. Which makes me wonder why apple would leave a gap there in the first place. If you struggle to get it in place you may have issues down the road but it’s cheap enough if you purchased air pods.
4,I like it may have to replace it every few months tho
2,Took it off immediately after install
3,They tore the minute I pulled the paper off them once I had them in place. It was a waste of money.
3,Product came on time it was easy to put on but it didn’t last pass 5 days even with minimal use to the AirPods
2,Installed dust seal on AirPods Pro MagSafe case and not 12 hours later missing a chunk. It Fit perfectly and looked like it’ was solid but I was Shocked to see how quickly they Fell apart. Maybe I got defective misprint?  For the 10 bucks cost it’s not worth Going through the return process.  Luckily I have a good case cover that Makes me question Needing seals in the first place
5,Excellent
4,The application is easy as long as you follow the directions I will say after a few days I noticed some minor lifting on one of the edges so if you go for this dust guard be a little more gentle when taking the pods out of the case. It's a solid shiny color but seems to be a mix of gold and silver (I still don't know which one it is). The pack comes with two so worst case scenario I could just reinstall a new one. Good value for the price.
3,Not a bad product I’ve only been actively using this for about a week. The AirPod case shuts well with a minimal gap. If this was solid gold instead of being plated the case could probably shut as if it wasn't there. It was a bit tough to line up the cover to the case. I didn’t need to use the sticker guide. I am noticing that the cover tarnishes extremely easy. Trying to wipe away finger prints just made it worse.
1,First I thought this was a great idea to protect my case. The first one I order it came on time. I opened the package and found that the dust guard was torn. So I returned it and the new one came the next day. Which was great. Then came to installing the dust guard. Not the easiest thing due to having to peel it off the protective sticker without tearing it. It is a thin piece of metal so it is somewhat delicate. I installed the guard they way the instructions say to and used a cotton swap to ensure it was secured to my Air Pod pro case. Case opened and closed properly  but when I went to remove my ear bud from the case. There was the problem it torn the guard. These are not easy to line up properly. It was off by such a mi•nute  amount that I was unable to tell it was not lined up properly. Not satisfied with their product due to the margin of error being so small and the product being so hard to remove from protective sticker. Also there should be a better way to have to line this product up it's not an easy thing to do.
4,Confusing instructions to get it on so i just ignored them but they look good
3,What a waste of money. I am so mad. First I bought the wrong size and got dust guards for the regular AirPods. Then I reorder these and I get only one pair that ripped before I could do anything. It’s not easy to take the damn plastic off the things and then when I finally did and was so angry and annoyed the stupid things ripped. I do t even know how. If there was a second pair in the box I could try again but no they want you to spend more money. I already wasted close to $20 on these. I rather get dust in my AirPods. Save your money.
2,I ended up tossing this. Too frustrating to install evenly ended up looking terrible. If there were two sets in the package it would have been worth it practice makes perfect.
3,When I found this item I was so glad because my airpods has always some stains on cover part that is rubbing.so right after purchased airpods pro I bought this item right away.After 1 day when i open cover top i could feel and hear the cover was being taken off.and 2nd day the cover near hinge was broken so i requested to replace item.But replaced item has still same problem. the cover's inside thin dust cover part is rubbing each other (top and bottom) so the cover is taking off. I really love that concept but durability.......
3,Is not very sticky so I am pretty sure it will fall off after a little bit of time
3,I bought this because on my old airpods the elago dust gaurds lasted a long time and took months to break but they did what they were supposed to. Now you can either go right or wrong when installing these and it's kind of easy to rip these. Unfortunately I cracked a small piece of these and over time they didn't last long. Sad
3,I placed it like instructions said but after not even a day of having it on it ripped.
4,Es un buen producto fino acabado y material de alta calidad se ajusta perfecto a base de carga de los audífonos AipodsPro de Apple. No es tan fácil la instalación es de cuidado viendo los videos y la cinta es muy sensible se despega un poco facil no creo que dure mucho y sea resistente. Con el tiempo se despegara facilmente.
3,This was very difficult to install and since it was just a millimeter off center the guard continuously scratched the side of my AirPods. Had to be removed within days. Hard to tell if it functions long term.
4,If you try to follow your gut you will ruin it. Watch the video
4,I really wanted these because I had the previous AirPods before these and I kept getting lint and dark spots that I swear was the hardest to clean. I ended up buying the pros and buying this product too knowing my experience from before. Putting it on was a little bit hard to figure out at first but I got it I had my pros and this product in them for about 2 weeks till the bottom part of the sticker started peeling off which was disappointing but it also could’ve been my bad handling of the airpods. But over all good product and good for price!
4,I mean like it broke about a week after almost fully like the pieces started breaking and falling off but that’s whatever. It’s pretty cool. I’d buy another if I had the money since I like how it looks. It was kinda hard to install. I cut my finger on the metal part and it broke when I was installing the top piece and bottom on.
1,I like the idea of that however the execution is bad and not worth the money.  Even if you've applied these types of stuff (screen protectors skins etc.) before this won't be easy.  The protector itself is very fragile flimsy and sharp around the edges. Part of the protector broke off on the 2nd day and after a week another piece broke off.  It's hard to apply evenly - no useful instructions included either. At the end of the day it was a waste of money for me due to the lack of instructions and the overall quality of the product.
3,Putting this on was a bit tricky and if you mess up and lift it to reposition the adhesion is pretty much gone (as you can see in the pic) it’s missing in a couple places but it does work pretty well as far as keeping dust out!! But watch those ends that break because it will cut you seriously!! I cut my finger twice!
3,Elago Dust Guard compatible with Airpods Pro 2nd generation is a total waste of money and I've stupidly already purchased these items more than once so I'm a fool for me it was completely difficult to even apply them and then once they were applied they came off easier than tape comes out of a piece of paper I'm so upset because they ripped so soon after I purchase them that there's no way for even to return them my money back even though I should be getting my money back cuz this was a scam if there ever was one
2,It was impossible to line up well and it broke super easily while trying to apply it. It’s a great idea and keeps the case super clean just incredibly hard to use.
2,When taking the AirPods out of the case the top dust guard was constantly being pulled off where you grab the airpod.
3,This is my second attempt at installing these guards and it disappoint they stayed on for a few weeks then ripped 🤦🏿‍♂️
2,The adhesive  is great but even though  I set it right it broke on the thinnest end like 3 days after  applying.
3,Started falling off within a month or two and didn’t really make a difference in terms of scratches.
4,So far after a couple of weeks of installing the dust guards they are still holding up with my daily use of my air pods. The installation was pretty easy. Overall this product is great.
3,It's not so much i dislike the product. It does make it more appealing when applied. The thing is when i applied it just about a week later because it's so think it must of not stick properly onto the airpods. When i opened the case a piece ripped offed. The rest is intact but obviously takes away now that it's ripped. Anyhow as i said it does/did make it look nicer.
4,I made sure to carefully follow the written instructions and the video tutorial. After closing my AirPods case ONCE the film ripped. I’d love the option for a refund/replacement.**UPDATE REVIEW as of 12/10**I reached out to elago after my first set ripped after installation. They promptly sent me a replacement at no additional cost. Getting the PERFECT alignment takes a lot of patience but it appears to be holding up for now. Even though the dust guard is extremely thin there is a small gap when the case is closed; this does not affect anything though. It looks good but installation requires a bit of patience.
3,Very good concept but I’m afraid that it doesn’t hold well long term or excessive. Maybe mine is faulty?
3,The product ripped immediately when trying to instal. I figured it’d be fine to try and apply the guard regardless but it wouldn’t stay put. Not only that but the guard was so u stable it actually cut me a few times when trynna grab my AirPods out of their case in my pocket. Did seem to protect against dust but the last cut it gave me was pretty bad so kinda upset over it. Then again just gotta be careful when Installing! Even with the video i still couldn’t do it so hopefully it’s better for all future buyers.
2,I bought this for my AirPods Pro when I got them because my old AirPods got way beat up around the magnets. I really like the way this looks but It chipped within a day of putting it on. I was SUPER careful to line it up right but my finger hit the edge as I tried to clean some dust out it... and that happened. The adhesive is SUPER weak - it almost feels more like the static electricity that holds plastic wrap to your counter.It's also pretty thick - my AirPods close still but it's just barely. Beyond just pushing the lid up a little further it also weakens the magnetic force that holds the case closed.Not super impressed but it's ok. It's expensive for the low durability. Something plastic would have been better I think. I hope that DBrand comes out with one of these because I imagine the tolerances will be a lot tighter.
2,The bottom part went on really easily when I went to put the top part of the guard on it would not line up right. One side would be lined up and the other would be off. This was my second pair because of the same problem with the first pair. I followed the videos exactly as it said. This would be a good product if it would adhere as it claims. Would not buy again.
4,This dust guard is one of the best ones you can get. Its very slim and durable. Although it is very difficult to apply correctly. Make sure to follow through with the video guide. This is my second time buying this because the first wasnt applied correctly and there were sharp corners and kept slipping off.
5,I was expecting an Amazon person to deliver the package in front of my door but it came in the mail instead.  It looks beautiful on my AirPods Pro.  Maybe I did not follow the instructions correctly but it was a little difficult to apply.  The lid closes pretty tightly  and my earpieces could still charge inside without difficulty.  At the end it turn out perfect.  I love the new look and hopefully it will prevent my AirPods Pro from getting that dirty ugly stain.  I also bought the earpiece covers from this seller.  Also hard to apply but really beautiful.
5,Over all not a bad product. A real pain to line up but that’s because of the case design. To bad no one offers a realistic carbon fiber pattern. Be very careful when installing them as these stickers are super thin. It’s a nice touch but not sure how long they will last.(June 8 2021) Edit: last less than 24hrs. In combination with the elago AirPods Pro Earbuds Cover Plus with Integrated Tips they made contact with the AirPods Pro on the lid. Which caused the top sticker to get stuck and rip. The bottom sticker gets caught on the left AirPod Pro when removing it from the charging case.
5,Too much money for the item. But it is amazing in every way
5,A little difficult to get right when sticking to the case the guide doesn’t help you place it on and in fact I found that it made it more difficult to apply. I didn’t get mine exactly on there like I would like but it seems to be sticking so I’m not gonna mess with it. Purchased this about a month or a little more ago. I’m very happy with how it stays on however wish it was easier to apply another thing is there is metal in it so the magnets for the AirPods in the case try to grab it when applying these dust covers which makes it that much harder to apply. No problems with ripping or anything.
3,Not the color I ordered. I wanted gold but got silver. Putting them on was a bit difficult. The magnetic was making it move away from where it goes even using the stuff it came with was not working it was easier by hand. Still like it though an will keep it
3,Be careful with this product. Apart from it being a great price point and a great shield overall be VERY careful and patient installing it. It is prone to snapping on one of the thin parts. Most of the time you cant take it back out to adjust it while installing it. Very good shield would buy one again but it can and will break while installing if you're not careful.
3,I followed there instructions to the T & still didn’t end up working but I will say that little thing has some good adhesive. But I wouldn’t buy it again. I was as gentle as can be and it still tore in the skinny spot strip. Oh well waste of a few dollars. Try you luck
3,First of all I didn't realize this at first but the airpod pros come with a different material that doesn't collect that magnetic dust. However in addition the guard broke into little pieces within weeks. It shows finger prints keeps the case slightly open and is VERY DIFFICULT to apply. I would not buy recommend or smile on my purchasing of this item.
5,Fit great. Case still closes and stays closed  Instructions on how to use alignment sticker were not helpful. Ended up using what they came in to line up and stick. Just cut existing holder peal back side and stick it down. I work with metal so my AirPod pro case always had some sort of shavings and/or  dust stuck to the magnets that hold it closed by the end of week or even day. Have yet to try just installed however if stuff still gets in there it should wipe right away seeing the magnets are now covered with this product.
4,Looks nice and definitely seems to be protecting against the metal shaving mess I experienced with my AirPods gen1 - although I’ve only had my AirPod Pros for like two weeks at this point. Installation was challenging. You have to cut the plastic film it comes on all the way to the edge of the protector and then trying to get the metal film to stick to your AirPod case in the right spot took several tries. Two person job one to hold the case open and one to install.
3,As you can see in my pic the guard is not on my case.  Why?  Because it came down to a choice of either guard or the earbud covers.  The company that makes the guard does an externally great job of getting them precisely cut to fit and the margin of error for instillation is very VERY thin.  A little to thin for both the guard and the covers.
3,I got this for my wife’s AirPod Pros. She’s had it for about 4 months and with “heavy” use (I mean every day heavy use) they have started to fall apart. Installation is easy and it comes with directions. Would recommend if your looking for a little extra flair in your case.
4,The material is slick but since its so small and the case is too I had trouble installing it; yet I was using just my hands so there's that.
2,Damaged after fist days
4,Okay it seems like Apple has left little to no room for the APP’s case for any dust guard. That being said elago HAD to make their product thinner to accommodate this change in design. Unfortunately  the ultra thin dust covers can’t defy physics:1. Bends to the will of the strong magnets of the case when installing2. Breaks easily due to the thinness itself.3. Elago elected to provide only 1 set this time amid the circumstance that it is a more fragile design. (Airpods 1/2 sold as 2-pack)
3,My main trouble was sticking the bottom sticker onto the AirPods. Eventually it was impossible to fit it into the clasp area and in trying to do so I ripped the sticker so now I only have one applied. Aesthetically it looks fine but the application is essentially impossible to do perfectly. I think the hassle is not worth the benefit of a dust guard just wipe your AirPods once in a while.
3,I have two AirPods before I got the AirPods Pro. Since Apple has placed 6 magnets in their case this is an item that you must need ! As the magnets sucks to a lot of the dust. However the installation of product was really difficult. When I finally finished the installation the bottom row of the sticker decided to fall off. I will keep it for now and prevent further damage.
5,The most important review about this product is the installation and it’s easy just follow the instructions and do it slowly. There’s a video about it in YouTube if you confuse.
4,The product is perfect for your Airpod pros. But it does require alot of time and patience for the best results. I would suggest everyone watch the installation video before you begin with the install of the dust guards.  Only issues I had was the guide sticker didn't want hold the guards in place while trying to install them. Otherwise I did it the best I could.
3,It was kinda hard to get it on evenly it’s been on for a day and has already ripped in a narrow area.
1,Adhesiveness is very very bad and somehow it ripped itself leaving part of it just hanging instead of being stuck to the case… I would gladly pay $3 for this AT MOST….
3,If you want a “dust guard” that doesn’t last for one day buy it :)
3,Installation was really difficult!! Even after seeing the YouTube installation guide video I had to use my second pair after failing to install the first one correctly!!! That’s why am giving it only three stars!! But the product is really good & The quality is very high!!
3,It was ok. It is very hard to apply to the case. One side of the guard stared come off a little after I applied. Then I cut the portion and use it. Wished it easy to apply to the case
4,Installation was pretty easy. In my opinion for the price you’re paying they should give you 2 or 3 sets not just 1. Especially since they should know people will mess up. Also they look nice but I took out my left airpod and scraped the sticker and it won’t restick whatsoever. Basically have to be super careful. Looks very nice but probably won’t last long. ALSO very very very prone to fingerprints.
1,I have no idea why or what made me think this product would work. It’s junk the adhesive does not even stick and it tears soooooo easy. Worst product on Amazon.
4,The dust guard fell apart easily. I bought some for my AirPods 1st gen and they worked very well. I love this brand other than that but I have to admit it is very tough to apply these dust guards.
2,1.Yes this did scratch my AirPods but not to the extent to we’re it is very noticeable but can see if looking closely. Altought the case i don’t intend to use this product any further for fear of further damage.2.Another bad thing is it only comes with one so if you were to mess up then your screwed3.And another thing I ordered dark grey but it came in space grey but I didn’t really have a problemI don’t recommend you get this but keep in mind it’s not a horrible product.
3,The Guard Adhered okay except that middle section & I thought I’d leave it be but it ended up ripping anyways so not too durable. If the company offered a replacement it would make up for the lack of quality for the first product.
1,Damaged the stems of my AirPods cause of it being slightly not on line with the charging ports. Just clean your AirPods every now and then. Not worth it.
3,It’s more of a silver color. Pretty easy to install looks very nice
4,Tears very easy and the magnetism makes it hard to place with ease
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Dust guards are Ok they broke on me in two weeks I returned them and ordered the gold ones and they sent me solar ones I put them on they look good wish they could’ve got the order right and gave me gold but it’s not worth the hassle of taking them back off and calling up Amazon and going through the whole process again if they breakI will have no choice but to go through the process again
4,I got the gold color but next to the white outfit of my case the gold is hard to see. Even with my black protective case on
3,I really wanted to fall in love with this and buy more for family and friends so the too could protect their small investment from metal debris.That love was cut short after showing it off to my wife and her pointing out it was cracked!It wasn’t cracked upon installation or in package.I had high hopes for this little accessory.
3,It’s a really good concept but mine came with the stickers upside down so I had to peel them off flip them and then try to stick them to the AirPods but by the time I had done that I tore one and they were no longer sticky
4,It’s cool but hard to install but looks good.
1,Installed on my new 2022 Air Pod Pros very hard to get aligned. And didn’t stay stuck long at all ended up removing and throwing them away.
3,It is a little expensive I had the original ones for AirPods first and second gen those were FANTASTIC these only come with one pair as the other came with 2 pairs. These tip so easily and come off easily it isn’t funny. Wish they took the same approach as the 1st gen AirPods dust guard.
4,It’s gold but it’s very subtle it almost looks silver. I am disappointed in the color and would not recommend this if you want a vivid vibrant gold.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 DONT BY THESE!!!!! Don’t by these!!!! Don’t by these!!!! Don’t by these !!!! Don’t by these!!!!You going to break it I tried to be as careful as I could possible be and it broke 20 minutes after I installed it so don’t bother if you can find a plastic one go for it but these one metal looking think no!!!
2,I decided to buy these even after reading all of the negative reviews. I assumed it was just user error. The finish looks great but that’s where the greatness stops. The top piece was broken right out of the box. After much trouble with the bottom piece I was able to finally get it aligned perfectly. Even with the top piece broken I would have still been satisfied from an aesthetic standpoint if the bottom piece had held up. Unfortunately the bottom piece did not adhere properly and it also ripped shortly after installing. To make your buying decision as simple as possible I wouldn’t even accept a replacement set if the seller offered to send it out for free. It’s only a few bucks but don’t waste your time or money on these.
4,Product works as described. However the application process is cumbersome and if you mess up and try to readjust you risk tearing product. This happened to me and I adjusted as best as I could since I didn’t want to wait the amount of time it would take to return and receive replacement. Nevertheless a very good product.
3,Good look good product just the durability around the corners could be a little thicker if not careful it rips easy when placing it on the airpod casing
3,Worked for me for a week later on started to peel off and the thin side started to scratch my AirPods and it did split into 2 pieces. I did installed it correctly and balanced the 2 sided perfectly. I wish to buy it one more time but I’m ok without it.
3,Im not if it was me or the product but it wasn’t letting me charge my left earphone so once I took it off ( rip it off) it started working perfectly fine.
3,The product is very thin metal. The "guide sticker" tells you to use it to apply the dust guard however they don't tell you how. So I did what I thought would be best. If you are off just half a hair you will know. The metal creates a lip preventing the smooth removal of your AirPods. Decent concept.
5,The dust covers come on a sticker/film.  The way they put the dust covers on that film is terrible... the part that goes into the 'elbow' of the airpods case is in the middle of the film.  Use scissors cut the film down the middle between the two dust covers.  Get close to the edge of the dust cover so you can easily line up the cover with the airpods.I did this with the lower dust cover after struggling with the upper.  What was a challenge with the upper dust cover became a breeze with the lower one once I trimmed the film to apply the dust cover directly to the airpods without messing with the 'guide sticker' that was included.  Good luck!
3,Installation is straight forward. As far as durability goes the photo shows what happened after one week…on the plus side they look great everything else was perfect other than that
3,I love elago products. I used the dust guards for my Gen 1/2 AirPods and a piece hasn't broken off. Sadly. I bought around 3 of these and the top piece always breaks off.
2,Assembly wasn’t that bad once I figured out what the instructions were even saying.But the case won’t close with both of these in.And the bottom one broke after about 20 minutes.So I left the top one and trashed the bottom and the case closes completely.Note: if you are partial to the little “clack” when you close them this makes more of a full “thwuck.”
2,Very bad experience. The instructions were unclear the installation process wasn’t intuitive. The top part was easy enough but the bottom part was impossible to install and ripped apart right away. Disappointed.
1,I tried to contact the seller in regards to getting this replaced but their system said my message didn’t pass their “fraud filtering” so I have no choice but to leave my experience here: in a nutshell they looked great initially. Very shiny looked well cutout. The problem was taking them off of the plastic they’re attached to. One side immediately tore. Didn’t care too much and still tried to install the other side which I had gotten off without an issue but due to how flimsy the plastic was coupled with the metal they have inside of them made it nearly impossible because the magnets in the case would pull the smaller sides towards the charging area and in trying to reposition it both sides ended up ripping. At this point I was frustrated and attempted to take them off so I could send them back but it kept ripping into smaller pieces even when I used tweezers. Some of the pieces even got stuck near the charging area. Luckily I was able to keep them from going down where the buds actually charge. Good idea hate that I have to give it such a bad rating but seeing as how I am unable to talk with the manufacturer directly I have been extremely displeased with everything.
3,very hard to install had to cut the packaging in order to install the bottom part but im sure it does its job not a perfect install whatsoever and it sticks to the airpods quite well which is great but can make it hard to install
2,It does what it is designed to do but it doesn’t last long and presents other problems.  Installation took several attempts. Either the holes did not line up to allow AirPods into their charging slots or the sides of the dust hairs prevented proper closing of the lid. Daily cleaning and sanitizing of your AirPods and case is still necessary.  The dust guard started to come apart near the end of the second week. I suspect it is caused by taking the AirPods in and out.
4,The dust guard looked just like the picture and they make my airpods look a bit fancier! The application guide was easy to understand but be very careful when handling the dust guard since the sticky side is up and one of them accidentally stuck to the sleeve of my sweater resulting in it being creased and full of lint.
3,I like it but after month it getting cutted for unknown reason? But i like it lol
3,Over all decent product but I did have one of the thin pieces brake on the second day of use. Not sure what happened to it but it split and doesn’t want to stick to my case.
4,Installing was easy but then I somehow got a bubble. I didn't like it so I took it out on force. The next day other parts have been sticking out so I just took out that one small piece. It still works...
3,I don't know if it's just how I put it on but some of it just fell off my airpods. It was concerning but hopefully durability is good for other people.
2,I opened the package and while there was some form of instructions they were very unclear and left me just doing it because it's a sticker right?Wrong.Because it is thin it tears easily. And if you misalign it you may give yourself a nice metal "paper"-cut during normal use.Great idea wish I had read the comments though as kind of an expensive mistake.
3,It broke but it was that hard to correct I see the other reviews but it’s supposed to be delicate so idk.
2,Ok installation guide. Absolute crap. Makes no sense. They do a horrible job explaining how to properly install the dust guards. You mess up a little and the whole thing is now a waste of money. I finally got both in after trying to understand the instructions and my AirPods didn’t even close all the way. I made sure everything was lined up and it didn’t close properly. Last time I ever buy crap from Elago again.
5,When my sister first got her air pods she said that this area was the one area that got dusty and dirty the fastest. So when I ordered my pros I knew to get this. Putting them on was pretty easy just like a screen protector but the space was a bit akwaes for the bottom so far I haven’t had any issues but I haven’t had it on for very long.
3,These are not easy to install. I ended up failing the first time around and ordered a new set to try again. They do look really nice or cool.
3,Had them on for about an hour my case wouldn’t close all the way. Took them off and moved them same problem. They look really nice though.
3,Maybe two weeks of having it installed it started breaking and flaking off
3,Looks great but if you're the slightest bit off with placement you run the risk of pieces breaking off or the whole thing itself lifting. Dust still collects on it and in some cases will wipe off a bit easier but it doesn't eliminate the dust problem
2,I am giving this item 2 stars only because I can see the purpose of this item. However this item is way to hard to install because you need to line it up perfectly or else it will hang off one side. I feel like I needed a microscope when trying to install this thing. Not only that but this item continuously has the magnets on the AirPods trying to pull it into the wrong spot. If you mess up at all while installing it will end up looking terrible and you will most likely just remove it as I did. This product would be great if they are able to make some type of installation device similar to the ones made for screen protectors but as the item is right now I would say only buy if you have the steadiest of hands.
1,After a few months of usage. Ended up tearing up. 1 year warranty. Useless product.
2,This is pretty much a sticker. If it guards against dust ok but it's still just a sticker. Fragile - upper "guard" ripped while peeling it from plastic. Frustrating installation definitely not "easy installation" as stated on the package. I'll keep it for a while to see how it performs but already looking for a replacement.
1,It snapped after it was places when I closed the air pods the metal it’s made of snapped
3,It’s a cool product if you can install it correctly. There’s a lack of instruction and unless it’s placed 100% accurately the adhesion sucks. Being so even the slightest deviated causes problems when putting the AirPods back in the case. They’ll rub right against the metal film.
3,Maybe mine was a bit defective but a piece came off after a week or two of light use of my AirPods. But overall decent product. Fits well looks nice and easy to install.
5,I was able to put this on with some common sense and about 5 minutes of my time. Both top and bottom covers did not snap and i was able to line them up first try. I’m not sure why people have such problems in other reviews... must be some boomer who can’t figure out a simple sticker application. Anyways actually protects from dust especially with a complete cover on the case.
3,Producir is hard to line up and install
3,A little tedious to put on.And the EarPods scrapes them when you put them in.
4,This is my second purchase of this product. They are VERY sensitive and it was my fault I messed them up the first time. The “how to” video really helped me apply it the right way the second time. I love how it looks!
2,Not sure if I installed these wrong but they wouldn't stay seated. They eventually ripped a little and I left them in because they were still working. However I reached in to get my pods and I stabbed myself under the fingernail at some point. Took em out after that. Of course they wanted to stick to the case now. I had to scrape them out. Cool idea and it worked but i'm good on these.
2,Starts tearing off
2,Tried to install it carefully but the film is far too brittle and just breaks up into little fragments upon the slightest touch. Moving it around to adjust the placement will absolutely destroy it. Just keep looking this product isn’t worth it.
2,The pads when on super easy looked great but the issues is that it started to fall apart after a few days.
4,It’s really good just took some time to put on.
5,Very nice product keep the airpod case clean . I’ll will definitely buy it again . Great product And easy to apply .
1,Bottom piece’s adhesive wore off in like a week I only have the top guard still in my case. Definitely a waste of money will not be trying these again.
3,It ripped a day after I applied it and the case is closed most of the time.
2,Very hard to instal. They do not go on easily and if not done perfectly the rest time you are left with a mangled mess... mine are in the trash
1,I never thought I would ever write a review like this so if you're reading do NOT buy this LOL
4,Does what it says it would but placement is not super easy
5,It does what I want it to do.  I followed the directions online and on the packaging to install it.  So far it has stayed clean inside.  Hoping this will help with the small dust and such that gets down inside from your pocket Etc.  Would buy again.
3,They look nice and are easy to install if you watch the how to video on youtube. I don’t know if they protect from dust but you will have fingerprints and mine have already been damaged how? I don’t know.
2,The adhesion on this “Dust Guard” was not as efficient as it seems on product view. Within a couple of days of using this so called “Dust Guard” it started to peel off. It did not help that the “Dust Guard” did not even fit probably.I can not believe how fast this dust guard stared to wear off. Overall this “Dust Guard” is most definitely not worth the price and is not as durable adhesive or valuable as the seller claims it to be.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Those guard works really good and it wasn’t hard to install on my AirPods ProEstos protectores para los AirPod Pro cumplen con su tarea la verdad es que no son difíciles de instalar
4,It’s nice and fits perfectly
5,All I have to say is that it works and keep my air pod from scratching my case. I do wish the install was a lot easier those.
2,I was able to apply the dust guard to the AirPod Pro after several tries. It didn’t even last a week when the adhesive started to loosen and cause minor cuts to the AirPods and to my fingers. I was unable to get in contact with the seller and had to contact Amazon customer support in order to be issued a refund after sending the defective item back to them. Disappointing product and upset to not getting in contact with the seller. Purchaser be forewarned.
2,I thought it would be cool to have a cover on the inside to prevent the dirt from staining my AirPods Pro as I’ve seen it happen before on other AirPods. I think it’s on my part that putting it together was a bit harder than expected but not only a few days later the thinner parts of the product has come off and I just hope these don’t eventually fall off completely and only last me a month. Product has good potential just not going well for me though.
2,I guess I should have looked at reviews before buying. Installation may be a bit baby proof or I’m terrible at following directions. The top piece ripped during install. The bottom piece was installed and is still in place 2 weeks later.
3,bad line up and installation
2,I liked the color. That's pretty much it. Difficult to put on right and even when you do they wear out pretty fast. Tossed em after roughly a week and a half because they ripped in at least 4 spots from general (opening/closing maybe 3-4 times per day).
3,The top stayed on for like a week and then it peeled off.
2,After a while it starts to rip apart I don’t think it’s worth it in my opinion
5,Excelente acabado brillante le da un toque más Pro a los AirPods.
3,cute but a piece broke off within a few days of having it.
4,Pro tip cut the plastic it’s attached to in half and just flip it for easy install 5 mins no bubbles or tears.
1,I PUT ON THE DUST CLEANER THING AT MY AIRPORT AND EVERYTHING WORK OUT FINE. BUT WHEN I TRY TO PUT IN MY AIRPORT BACK IN THE CASE IT GETS STUCK AND WHEN I TRY TO TAKE IT OUT THE TAPE JUST RIPS OFF AND CAN NO LONGER BE USED.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT WORST PRODUCT YOU WILL EVER PURCHASE.
4,Easy installation patient needed can't say how durability from now. Time will tell
3,Se ajusta bien pero muy difícil de instalar. En una zona es muy delgado y se quebró durante la instalación
3,The adhesion wasn’t that bad but after a while it started pealing
2,I followed the instructions to the dime and installed them perfectly. But the adhesive on the back left wasn't sticking and lifted everytime I opened the case and now it just ripped itself apart. This was also my second purchase of this bc I messed up the first time.I had this dust guard on the gen 1 airpods and that is still working till this day almost 4 years no rips.But the Pro version doesn't even last 3 days and rips. So disappointed in this version of this product
1,The difficulty of putting these on your case is enormous.  This needs some sort of template to assiste to make them useful.
4,Product works great had trouble getting them to stick to my case ended up ripping them but made it work.
2,honestly this was not worth my money. i haven’t even taken my airpods outside of my house or used them much since i got these dust guards and i just got them a week or 2 ago and they’re already chipping off in 2 places as you can see in the picture. one place by the hinge on the left side and on that same side towards the front. would not buy again. :/
2,Although this seemed to be like a great idea (especially keeping in mind that on my old Airpod the dust and debris  accumulated quite fast inside the charging case despite diligent and frequent cleaning) after installing this on my new Airpod case literally not even a day passed before it was already breaking apart sticking to the Airpods very easily or otherwise just going missing. The installation process was also challenging and it definitely requires some patience. Overall the idea is quite good but the actual product lags behind in terms of durability and quality.
4,Couldn’t close it al the way. Left a little gap. Had this on for about 2 weeks & it ripped already. Also it was very hard to put on.
3,Looks amazing! But broke within 3 weeks. Looked good while it lasted!
3,I misaligned it about quarter millimeter and was shaving the side of my brand newly purchased Airpods Pro. So yeah. Over priced but does remove that lil black stuff as now only that part I had to rip off has a bit of that magnetic stuff.
4,It’s actual nice but it took me some time to put it on
2,These seem nice at first glance but once you install them there a pain shure they do there job but the adhesive gave out after a month. :(
4,Follow the instructions. Recommend cut the guide on half to install. See how long it last.
2,even before applying the protector comes between two sheets of film. while peeling back the film the protector tore already making it difficult to use.the material seems like its metal shaving and actually pretty sharp so caution when applying.was looking forward to the item but disappointed by the quality.
4,Very hard to install. I never got to use the one I ordered. It tore as I tried to install and after that it became impossible to stick on. I watched all the install videos but once mine tore it became impossible to install on my AirPod’ Pro.
4,First tab was easy to put on. Second tab shock is mIn tab was not as easy. I had to re pull it with tweezers to correct it.
5,Maybe some people just need to be a little more patient when putting this on their AirPods? As I had absolutely no trouble. Everything aligned perfectly well didn’t break and it’s not cutting my buds at all. It also looks great with the elago case!
3,I love the idea and I love the color but after applying the dust guard the exact way they showed in their video tutorial it still managed to tear after one day of use.
2,La verdad al principio pensé que era una excelente inversión pero al pasar de un mes empiezo a despegarse y conforme se despegaba de iba dañando y rompiendo mas. Además para poderlo colocar es difícil ya que si no lo haces bien se daña ya que es como una lámina muy delgada y si se doll a se daña
1,When you grip an airpod to take it out of the charger it comes right off and cracks. Does not stick good at all. Waste of money
3,I bought the gold version and it looked more like silver. Had them for about a week and took an AirPod out and it ripped. It’s an okay product mainly for aesthetics.
1,Okay I wanted to love these because my husband is an iron worker and gets his AirPods dirty and dusty at the construction sites. Let’s start with the fact that these directions were so horrible and after about 10 minutes of trying to understand how to do it based off the instructions I put them on my own way. I cut the sticker with the guards in half and put them on that way. The best part about this though was the fact that after all of that frustration I check my email and they send an email with clear instructions on how to place the dust guard (NOTHING IN THE PACKAGE SAYS “check email for instructions” btw!) and then to top it alllll off after having it on for less than TWO HOURS the dust guard BROKE!!!! (Picture attached!) so save your money and time buy a different better one! Good luck!
2,The dustguards are a great idea and another way to personalize and give some life to the pale white case of the Airpods Pro. But the reality is that it is a poorly put together idea after 10 days of use the dustguards started to fall in pieces on the more thin trims just open the case and you start to find chunk of the bottom layer attached to the top layer without previously showing any sign of tear or wear off.
1,Tore within 2 days of applying to AirPods. Save your money and avoid this product
5,Very easy application!! However after 2-3 weeks the dustguard started chipping and losing its stick. So I contacted the company and they acted so quickly about the situation and even insisted to send me a replacement! Would definitely order from them again.
5,So I bought these for my new Airpods Pro after buying a set for my girlfriends Airpods. These are considerably harder to install than the regular airpods. I messed up installing them and tore them. I admit it was my bad not the product. I actually got a piece stuck to the case and when I shut it it scratched the case a little. I admit to it being my fault and I’m going to give them another shot. I already ordered them so we will see what happens. Best practice is buy the two pack just in case.
2,I purchased two for my daughters and my cases. I was able to get mine installed in spite of the confusion directions but my daughter broke into 3 pieces during install. Using tweezers i was able to actually get them in place and looked decent but as soon as you take and EarPod from case it pulled the cover apart so i threw the pieces out and it was a waste. Great idea but just way to thin and difficult to install. save your money its easier to clean the dirt with q-tip and alcohol once a year
4,Does what it was meant to do but there is one gripe... the small bit that comes in contact with the AirPods themselves whenever I take the buds out is starting to peel. Aside from this issue I like the aesthetic and functionality the dust guard provides.
4,It is perfect but little hard to be done by yourself it needs more innovative way to be attachedThanks anyway I like it very much
3,it started falling apart after about a week
3,The dust guard ripped due to how thin it was. Application of the bottom piece was the hardest to apply.This is my second purchase sadly.
3,It can be nice and I can see the purpose for it but it is not that easy to install. Even when you get it pretty centered the airpod case still doesn’t fully close and is open by like a millimeter and can be a little annoying.
1,The bottom one tore cause it had a weird bubble in the corner while trying to adjust it it wouldn’t work and tore it up cause it stayed put. So good adhesion but tore like paper which would be expected from how thin it is but sucks cause it didn’t lay right. I don’t know if that’s good enough value for my money I still have the top one placed but it looks oddly balanced so I think I’ll take it off.However! Do not let this negative review turn you away I think it would’ve worked if I didn’t suck at putting on the bottom bit and would’ve worked really well.
5,Not a bad product at all I got my AirPod pros  and these on the same day and it was already preventing stuff from getting into the case don’t listen to people saying there breaking and what not if you take your time on the installation you will be perfectly fine look up a vid and don’t rush it 💯
2,I’ve had this product less than a month and it has already ripped off. It looked pretty cool when I first applied it to my AirPods Pro case however after time it started lifting. I feel this was waste of money. Don’t waste your time this product is no good.
3,Product doesnt stick as well and easily peels off also very flimsy
1,wouldn’t recommend
2,I like many other consumers looked at videos about the product and saw these they looked cool and they were good for your case. However when I got them they only came with 2 so you have one shot and if you ripped them thats it. I ripped the top cover and got very frustrated the bottom one got one but it is almost impossible to line it up properly and they only came with a sticker and the guards. They sticker method was to hard so I put them on maunaly. Dont buy if you have shaky hands or cant assemble something that requires 0 movement.
2,The margin of error is too low if you install it even slightly incorrect each time you get the pods out it will tug at the sticker eventually peeling it off. Overpriced and too flimsy
2,You can tell it’s a cheap product. The stickers come on a piece of plastic you are supposed to use to put them on with but it gets it the way and makes it very hard. They don’t stick very well and want to come off... I have to keep sticking them down. Over all not a great experience.
5,I was little bit worried about this product. Becasue there are a lot of 1star reviews. But no matter what I read I just bought this dust guard. TBH it was pretty easy to install anyway. There is a simple guide in the box. So if you guys follow the instructions correctly you guys make your Pro looking good!  The Key is following the instructions!  This is what I want to say for future costumers.
2,This is a nice idea to "protect" your expensive Airpod Pro. But it is not easy to install even following the instruction video due the hinge of case. Only used for a day and it was broken :-(
2,This is extremely flimsy and fragile.  The weakest point is obviously at its thinnest and it is right there that the product snapped.  The product would probably work well if it can be installed properly but unless you have the hands of a top tier surgeon good luck getting it on there without messing it up.  The company needs to work on a better transfer system getting the product from sticker to AirPods.
4,Good product just a pain to put on and must take time and care cause will rip. But once on it loks good!!
3,Decent but starts to rip after awhile. Good for money
1,I wanted to love this product especially after it was featured on a YouTube video - but Its just not happening even after watching the install video. This was a major struggle and I had to do this for two AirPod pros! This dust guard tore into so many pieces that it now looks like a collage on both AirPod pros. I was determined to get this done correctly that even went as far as ordering a pair of second guards and still with the second pair I got the same results. Nowwww I believe part of the reason for the tears and uneasy install was because the guards cutout was slightly off meaning they didn’t seem to exactly mimic the dimensions of the AirPods so trying to align the guards and the slots led them to tearing. The material itself was thin enough to hat pulling up the guard to align led to tearing buttttt it was also sharp edged.Ugh still on the lookout for a quality dust guard.
2,Had the dust covers on for a week and they started to tear and split! Then the slivers that would come off would go in your fiber like a splinter….this brand sucks.

1,I can see how someone might really need this to reduce the amount of microscopic metal buildup but it is really hard to get off. I installed the top one with no problem then was kind of off with the bottom one but never fully placed it down. I then began peeling it up and it ripped down the middle and it took an hour to get the rest off.
1,I'm not complaining about them cuz I think it was my fault maybe I putted it to much on the edge near the front and that's why it broke or maybe not I don't know
3,It already broke. Only last for one weeks
2,This is the second time I bought it. It’s still ripped easily didn’t even last a month
2,This product is very flimsy and if not placed correctly then it will come off. It’s not easy to place either.
3,It is a good product but the one problem is it chips off real easy and gets caught up on the AirPods at times. I am really good at installing these. I have had one for every AirPod and have installed many others.
5,Good luck
3,Not to much
3,It was hard to put on and it broke
3,Not sticking well
3,Broke on installation very then... as I guess it needs to be.
4,Adhesion
4,It took me 10 minutes to install the upper part. The lower part was more difficult to control the installation process. After a while it was damaged and wasn’t able to remove the inner part ;(
3,I like the product but it is hard to install falls apart easily but with a product like this it should be expected
3,The media could not be loaded.
1,The product was difficult to put on if you don’t get it on perfectly the first time forget it it’s not going to work. I decided to use it anyway because what the heck I paid money for it I would use it but about two day’s into using it it started falling off and actually cut my finger at one point opening my AirPods case
5,The dust guards look amazing after installation!  They give the inside a splash of shiny color.  Who doesn’t like shiny things?  The added sticker to help with installation was a nice touch.  I watched the video for installation on YouTube and it was still hard to install - definitely have to take your time and be careful.  Once you get it though it is well worth it.  Highly recommend getting the 2 set just in case the first one becomes a trial and error process.
3,It came broken and when I tried to salvage it it just shattered into more pieces.
2,After the terrible installation process I fell asleep and when I woke for work I opened my AirPods case and the dust guard had stuck to itself (I had installed it perfectly fine) and teared the bottom cover in half... Would not recommend purchasing.
2,Had to throw it away.  It's a thin sheet of metal and can break if you are not careful.  It's sandwiched between two sheets of plastic and the install process can be tricky.  No do-overs.
3,It breaks very easily and it’s very hard to install but good protection.
2,I never did figure out how to correctly use this. The directions were not clear at all. It ended up ripping while I was trying to apply it to my AirPods. Unless you already know how this works don’t buy cuz you’ll break it trying to get it on.
3,The adhesive is weak and lower part is difficult to place lasted a week.
3,It started falling apart but I’m a mechanic so it could be that I’m too rough
3,The product is great and fits just fine but the instructions and guide were of no help. Very difficult to line up on the AirPods case.
3,The instructions on how to apply were not very clear and they ended up starting to peel pretty quickly.
2,Nice in concept. Complete pain to install and be careful they’re delicate and sharp.  Ripped one thing to get it off the sheet then slicedMy finger open trying to put the second one in.
1,Very difficult to install and broke apart into many pieces with the slightest pressure.
3,The product is amazing and easy to install itself! I was just really unhappy that I ordered a Gold Plated Dust Guard not a Silver one.
1,Looked coolLooked forward to putting it on my airpod prosThen bottom one was challenging yet doable to attach ( the magnet pulls the product into place  so took several attempts to install straight.The top part tore in the installation and looks badIt is pulled in quickly by the air pod pros’ magnetic closer and it tore.Looks jacked up and sticks out in a stabby my finger wayDisappointed 😕😐
1,I NEVER take the time to write a review but this time I did. all of the reviews about this product being hard to put on and it being garbage is absolutely correct. first of all the directions don’t many any sense whatsoever. then when you finally figure out how to put the dust covers on it’s literally impossible without them ripping or getting stuck or something. they are super thin (yes I understand it has to close) but if it gets stuck to the wrong spot on the airpods and you have to move it you’re screwed because it’s going to rip.SAVE YOUR MONEY or buy them elsewhere. i’m out the money and dust covers.
5,i loved this product. after i put it on i wouldnt get dirt on the inside cracks. just when you pput it on makesure it is clean. i didnt clean it fully which made mine come off. but definitly worth it
2,As you can see from the photos the back of my bottom protector is bubbled and didn't stick. Makes a clicking noise when I close because it was rubbing.  I don't think is the correct way. Thought it was easy to install and very fast shipping but this didn't adhere correctly. Not sure if ill use it again.
3,I had these for my regular AirPods and the were easy to install. But for the airpod pros they way they want you to install it’s almost impossible to get the base in without ripping or tearing it.
2,Has them on my AirPods for a couple days no issue. They then torn in the middle for no reason
3,Very difficult to install. You only get 1 so if you mess it up you need to buy a second like I did. Once  installed looks great n does it’s job.
2,This product is a good idea however when trying to install the strips would not come off the guide sticker that is included to help install the strips onto the air pods. After 10 minutes of trying to install them the lower strip ripped and I have yet to install any of the strips to the air pods! This requires a lot of patience and steady hands for sure. It is stressful trying to get them on and I have yet to do so.
2,Wasn’t enough instructions about how to apply it. Ended up ruining mine by cutting it due to lack of info on how to apply properly.
2,Just hard to attach to the air pods them self
2,First off I ordered space gray & I received chrome. Secondly the adhesion is very “wonky” being that you can not pick them up with the guide sticker they come with & they ripped in two places while I was trying to put them on the case.
5,I have a loving hating relationship with this sticker  it fits perfectly even thought it feels kinda doesnt close quite complete in time since I ordered it just a couple days ago the upper part started to come off and I rip it off
3,It was very hard to apply and got ripped
4,Looks good not very easy to apply and not sure on what it prevents but it looks good.
3,The dust guard works well it gets the job done the problem is the durability there are sections very narrow that come out after a month of use.
1,This was extremely annoying to put on once I did I noticed the AirPods no longer would close fully. I tried to remove them to return it and they immediately ripped/broke. Don’t buy these
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The title says it all. Went on without any problems. Still on as I write this. I approve. Not that anyone's listening anyway.🤷‍♂️
2,The application instructions are clear and helpful sticks well and overall was a good product until I opened my AirPods case the next day and the sticker was in pieces. Really disappointed maybe it was just the one I received.
2,This is the 3rd one I've order and not the best experience with this product 1st one didn't last long before falling off 2nd one was damaged and the last one completely fell off when i open my case
2,I ordered this product because it was referred  to me by a friend. Well got it in the mail and the instructions are very minimal. It doesn’t explain anything intact there are really no instructions just 2 bullet points on the plastic thing they are stuck too. Second thing is I ordered the rose gold one and they sent me a silver one. Third it’s impossible to get the air bubbles out
2,Very annoying to put on and it isn’t durable at all. It starts to fall apart.
4,Kinda hard to put on but they hold up for the most part
5,love it great item
1,They don’t quite match the fit of the case and even took some pieces of my earbud off by nicking it off :/
2,Disappointed with this product. Hard to install properly with the layout of the product. Very frail. When I placed it on my AirPods it broke by barely touching it. Not the best adhesive either. Look for something else.
1,This piece of #2 costs $10.99 and literally broke in less than 2 weeks like whatttttt???? I didn’t even get the CHANCE to clean the sticker or do anything but apply it to my AirPods case. This is more worth like $1. It also closes leaving a gap meaning it’s too thick so their advertisement is a lie. It does not close without a gap. To add onto that as you can see in my photo it get pretty dirty looking so if you’re a clean freak you’d have to constantly clean it which you probably shouldnt because the QUALITY is so CHEAP. Save your money and try another brand that is cheaper and better quality than this one.
1,I cleaned my AirPods before I put this on it and they just didn't stick properly. Also they have a tendency to rip and tear if they are just barely misaligned with the holes on the AirPods case.
2,Parts of it broke off for no reason
3,Got one half on the other half ripped on install. Can be quite sharp to the touch if not aligned perfect. Will not use them.
2,It does not stick on well and roped a little from me taking the earpiece out. I took painstaking care to put these in
3,The concept is great an effective however the application is tricky as it’s a sticker.Be careful of removal and what should be provided then separated as single use case
1,After getting completely frustrated trying to make these things work I just went ahead and threw them out. Lesson learned
5,These work great easy to install and most importantly the lid closes all the way. Super happy with these dust guards and they match my case lol
1,The first set I bought I really messed up the application. So figuring the ripping was due to human error I bought a second set. The application went really well and I loved the look. However when I opened the case I noticed the film had ripped in the front and back - on separate sides.I really like the idea of them and would maybe re-purchase if they lasted a few months but this was less then an hour.
1,Horrible by the next day it was completely coming off it’s chipped all over place & it’s been less than a week that I put it on my phone also wasn’t the easiest to put on
5,The product is okay it is just suer important that u apply correctly they do a decent introductions video nut I feel they could do more to make it easier on condumers
2,Received these today go to put them on and they aren’t even. Lose to fitting correctly the top portion was so bad it wouldn’t even stick. The bottom piece fits but couldn’t use the top piece waste of money.
3,Really hard to put on and veary flimsy also broke in 2 different spots I don’t really recommend it. Really hard to apply on AirPods
4,It got damaged after I put it not worth the money
1,I was pretty excited to receive this I had my Airpods Pro as a gift and I wanted to protect them so I bought a case and these guards. I got prepared followed the directions on the guide sheet and even watched a video before doing it. I soon realized how hard it was to install them on my Airpods Pro case but that is no the worse; the worse part is that after ONE attempt the bottom guard just broke. Still optimistic I tried to install the second one with the same result. I know now that I was a fool buying this item. Please don't fall for it.
4,They are nice but not as dark as the picture shows!
4,I liked the finish and texture of the dust guard. It’s  a bit difficult to apply perfectly but it looks very nice. Good quality for a low price!
1,The product came to me fine but the issue is with the product itself. I had really enjoyed the concept of this because my AirPods get dirty on the inside. I had an awful time trying to get them aligned perfectly but I did do it! Not in the way they showed you on the package because they put one of the stickers upside down!! So I had to take it off and fiddle with it for 15 minutes trying to get it on there while it kept sticking to my hands. Finally I did get them both on there. However they made it sound like my AirPod case was creaking when it was being opened! I had then saw after a few opens of the case one of them actually ripped off a piece! I ripped them both off in frustration. A total waste of money.
5,Good product. When putting it on  it was kinda confusing on how to put it in. But looked at the YouTube video.  Love how clean my airpods look. The Guard does a fantastic job.
5,really liked the use of it
1,I’d seen a few videos mentioning how this can help preserve the interior of the AirPods case so I figured I’d give it a shot.  This was the worst product I’ve purchased in years!  The top piece went on easily but the bottom piece ripped in multiple places while installing and won’t stay on.  It’s so thin in places that the littlest pressure or movement while installing will rip it.  Luckily it was cheap (around $7) so it wasn’t a big deal.Save yourself a few  dollars and avoid this money and time waster.  You’ve been warned.
5,overall very happy with these! took a few tries to install but afterward they look great & have been on for months now! very protective. only con i have for them is that they can become a little smeared and pick up on fingerprints rather easily. not a huge deal though because they can be wiped clean!
5,B 4 I put these on my air pod pro case they used 2 get a lot of dirt an lint from putting my case in my pocket when I was working. Now they keep all the dirt an lint out of the case. They work good 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
4,Follow directions with transfer paper or it will rip quickly
2,It seems like a good product but the material used is so thin that mine tore besides the suggested  method for installing these stickers were just hard to accomplish as my hands are very shaky when trying to be precise. Maybe if an extra pair were included I wouldn’t have a ripped sticker so buyer beware... even the simplest mistakes atone with tears if your not careful :/
2,I love the idea no doubt about that but it doesn’t stick strongly. Every time i take the airpods out it comes out with it
5,I didn’t follow the video/instructions and manually put each sticker on myself. Process was quick and seamless. Just be careful with the stickers as they’re a bit delicate but they adhere to the case well. Once installed close and push down on the case for a few seconds and you’re done!
1,Instructions were not easy use
2,This product works very difficult to apply to airpods.. not very good for the price it broke very easily. Idk if this helps or anything but yeah not worth the price
2,It would not close perfectly. Which i think would be more prone to have dirt inside the case. The dust guard thin but it still leads to a small gap when you close it
5,Bought it before new AirPod case inevitably  gets dirty. Not bad.
5,I had the issue first when i got the product. But i have explained it to the seller and they have responded very quickly and considered my request. The product is Durable also adhesion is too god. But should be careful when u install it on pods because they can be easily breakable.
2,It broke upon installation and that's about it.  I assume the dust will only accumulate now on the small missing gap so it should be easy to clean.  First world problems.
5,I bought these for my AirPods Pro’s. They were a little difficult to put on cause it kept wanting to stick where it shouldn’t. But that was probably just me. Otherwise it took maybe 5 mins to put on and looks good. It’s also stayed on since I put it on and doesn’t slip or pull away.
3,These were a little bit hard to install but after we got them on they have held up well.
1,This product is a total mess I tried to stick it in my AirPods pro case using the sticker guide they provide once you put them in the Airpods case it doesn't attach at all. they detach once you try to retire the sticker guide. If you manage to stick them in the AirPods case (A very hard task) they will detach by themself I pinched myself a finger trying to adjust the bottom part but went broken.If you are in the mood to throw away some money this is the product for it.
2,I like the product but when I went to install as the directions stated the top did not adhere correctly and gets caught when opening the case. I do like the concept of the dust guard.
1,First bad buy on amazon in a while got these because someone on YouTube recommended these as a good accessory to get for my AirPod Pros and they would be a good accessory minus the fact that they are not easy to install AT ALL the instructions aren’t clear I even watched a video on how to install and I ended up ripping one just as others have that I’ve read and when I installed it didn’t seem that they fit very well because I could feel the covers on the Edges when I removed my airpods from the case the covers would lift every time I took my airpods out they didn’t stick to my case very well so I ended up just removing the covers all together. Not worth the price.
2,They come between a piece of plastic on the back and adhesive on the front. When removing the backing the dust guard split in one of the thin parts. Once torn it’s pretty much useless because the ends curl up and since it’s thin metal will scratch the AirPods or the case. When I had both on the case didn’t close flush like it does without them applied.
3,Really hard to install and started to scratch my airpods looks nice but needs to have better directions.
3,Not bad to install but the durability is not great they break and it peels off
1,One of the worst purchase decisions I’ve ever made. I have looked at these for years and I finally decided to make the purchase. Both pieces tore when trying to attach the guide sticker to the dust guard. Tried to make it work anyways but the guard proceeded to continue to tear when trying to align to the case. If you do not set it perfectly the first time there is no adjusting to make fit. Trying to adjust to fit the case results in bends and tears in the guard making it useless. Luckily it was only a $10 purchase but it was definitely a waste of $10. I would not recommend anyone purchasing and I will never purchase again.
4,Looks really good and easy to install
2,It was a pain in the butt. You had to really meticulously spend a lot of time trying to put it on correctly. After a while it starts to peel off because you’re using your EarPods a lot . I wouldn’t buy it again
1,Worthless does not cover as show too small and when you put pods in or out it cokes off
1,Only reason I’m giving it a 1 star is because when I placed an order. I purchased a used one and when it arrived it was damaged. It was unusable it was broken. I returned it and order a new one and I love how it actually protects the case of your AirPods. It sticks well it actually last a long time on the case if you stick it on right. For 8.99 I figured you could at least give another set just in case you mess up you have the opportunity to do it right again.
2,Was excited for the product but when applying the guards it cracked in three places then a piece totally fell off in the middle after a few open/closes. Not what I was expecting
1,I’ve tried two of these and even with the video it’s not very simple to understand how to install. The first time one of them was misaligned just slightly and ended up scratching my Airpods Pro. It was only after that occured that i saw in the product images that it warns about that. For something as important as that it really needs to be more clear. I’m a fairly technical minded person so if i missed it then i’m sure i’m not the first one to do so. After the attempt with the second one i purchased i gave up. I would rather just keep my Airpods case clean on it’s own rather than deal with this and keep wasting money.
1,Well it’s a disastrous shopping experience for three reasons:1. I followed every step on the instruction video and it did not work. So I had to peel off the tiny pieces of dust guard and put on manually.2. While doing that I accidentally sliced my finger tip on the edge of AirPod Pro and it was cut to bleeding.3. Worst of all it is all durable at all as shown in picture. Broken on the second day?! You must be kidding me.Well last but not least a piece of suggestion and a question for Amazon: in cases like this how can we return and get refunded as if we peel it off the AirPods it is basically destroyed.
5,Very nice touch to my AirPods Pro!! They look elegant and a breeze to install just make sure your work area is clean of dust and debris while you apply the film it is very thin but if you follow the steps correctly you can’t go wrong!! Quite the value for my money I am very pleased with this purchase. Thank you Elago!!
2,Main problem with them is they only come with one set so when u mess up like I’m sure most people do on accident then it’s ruined I got the top on perfect but slipped trying to get the bottom alined once it did there was no retrying I tried to take it off to re-aline and it just ripped into three peices
1,Not only is the guide that comes with it to place it convoluted and doesn’t work AT ALL but if you’re serious about it staying you should paint some glue over where you place this because they will come right off even when placing on a brand a new case (I bought two one for my sister and one for my mom my moms AirPods were new).
1,Bought these thinking they would protect from dust over time I installed them perfectly(by spraying with a solution to not stick to everything immediately) but the edges are still pronounced enough to scrape the AirPods. Now my $250 headphones are scrapped and grooved because of a $10 product that in retrospect was completely unnecessary. I used to love Elago but even the color is not the same as the pictures and there is no way to fix the damage to the AirPods even after removing the dust guard.Side note: the dust guard is thin but not thin enough it leaves the case open ever so slightly which actually invited more dust in.
2,Rips really easy not very durable does wat it’s needed but doesn’t last and very hard to install as well
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The dust guard is easy to install. Keeps dirt from getting trap in the case; after closing the lid. I recommend pairing it with the silicon earbuds cover. Love the product.
1,This product had that sleek look with attractive color that was perfect with my case that i had. Though after using it for a few weeks it became very apparent that the “dust guard” clearly wasnt doing its job of keeping dust away. I had to wipe it off every day just to make it look good. Also keep in mind that this product isn’t fingerprint proof. DONT waste your 10 dollars!!!
1,Applying the product to the AirPods was a struggle and the instructions were not clear or helpful or even relevant.  After a week it starts peeling off piece by piece. This leaves so many exposed sharp edges that flap around that I would cut my finger whenever I would graze against the product. It’s like a deep paper cut. Horrible.
2,It stays on and its good but it tears so easily and barely touched it when getting my AirPods and and the bottom sticker ripped
1,Not a fan. Although I will admit part of my problem was user error. Installation of these dust covers was extremely difficult and I actually messed the top one up so bad I had to take it off completely and trash it. The bottom one however I did get on but was just SLIGHTLY misaligned and every time I pull an ear bud out it catches and is beginning to peel the adhesive up and crack/tear/break (like what you see in some of the other reviews) the metal dust cover itself.May consider another pair and see if I can get a better stick but initial impressions I’m not impressed.
4,They are ok but the edges are so sharp that they cut my fingers when trying to take them out
1,I bought this product and it did not stay on my airpods. I bought 2 one for each of my two sets of airpods and fortunately only installed one to see how it worked. It did NOT work and I returned everything but the packaging for the first set was long gone and they would NOT honor the return I sent them.I rarely write reviews ... only if I feel strongly. Do NOT buy this product unless you are prepared to get ZERO value.
2,The product broke apart and revealed sharp edges that sliced my fingers every time I opened the AirPods case
4,It’s good just needs a better way to put it on.
1,First off it was very difficult to install even after watching the video they provided. Did not want to stick on my Airpods so then I kept trying and eventually broke and cut my finger very deep! (Look atpicture) Now I have a broken unusable product and a cut up finger. And oh it came a day late even with prime.
2,Extremely difficult to install. Even with instructions and taking a lot of time one set broke apart and then would pull off when taking out headphones. Ended up with it stuck to me and other things in pieces. Was able to get one installed but still not great.
3,It’s hard to put on and it later starts to peel itself off
3,corners and overall fit not exact I like the feel look and tight fit
2,Put it on correctly as instructed and it snapped the next morning somehow.
1,I really wanted to like these! The idea is genius! The application is complicated to say the least. The video makes it look so easy but it is not. And if you don’t get it lined up right the air pod catches the edge of the dust guard. It is a waste of money for sure. I spent way too long figuring out how to adhere it to the dust guard and just used my fingers to line it up. That was quite frustrating. I definitely would not recommend this.
1,I should have read the reviews before buying and wanting to customize my case. These are horrible. No matter what I did these do not stay. It’s not the alignment as I even had other people try. It’s perfectly placed into the places it should be. However it does not stay. I just wasted my money on some stickers that do not stay at all. The case is magnetic - why wouldn’t these be magnetic? Don’t waste your money!!!!
1,This product is to fragile to properly Install. Big waste of time
2,Too hard to put on try to watch a video or something to install this correctly otherwise save your money
1,These are absolutely awful to install in the AirPods. My first problem is that they came off on the wrong side of the plastic so the adhesive side was backwards. So I had to take them off with my fingers flip them around and put them back on the sticky plastic. After finally getting both installed I don’t think they will even stick for the rest of this day. The bottom one ripped and started to come up. Also I ordered gold and got the dark sliver instead. The box even says “18k gold plated” and I got the wrong color. Don’t buy these trust me.
1,The thing is made of metal and when you try to apply it to the case the magnets constantly try to pull the thing towards them which means that you can pretty much never get a good fit. The quality is also bad and broke while applying due to the magnets. Returning immediately.
2,I have bought this product before for my airpods 1/2 but when it came in the mail today I immediately tried to install it but it ripped even though I very carefully tried to be careful with the film. This is a very delicate item and I have contacted elago for help hopefully they respond.
1,I was very excited about this as a way to keep my Airpods clean. This is terrible. Bad instructions. No way to easily install. I ripped the bottom one within 2 minutes while installing it. do not buy. I expected more from Elago.
2,easy to cut yourself with the Sharp edges I have scars  to prove it
5,I’ve owed AirPods for some time. I must admit that I hated the look of a dirty lid. This helps keep a clean look without scratching.
1,Do not bother with this product. I week after installing an edge tire. I wen through the hassle of asking for replacement sending back the the problem one. Received the new one installed it again. 2 weeks later again a piece tore but this I said whatever I’ll deal with it. And today again another piece tore from the top part.  These are not durable unfortunately. And it wasn’t my installation as I followed the instructions exactly.Too bad in theory they looked nice. But definitely not worth the cost.
4,hmmmmmmm
5,Nice compliment to case!  I just put this on last week so cannot comment on durability yet. It was easy to install & really looks nice!
1,This product tore immediately after removed from package. I tried to be as careful as possible but it is so flimsy and thin. Removing it from the packaging will cause it to break. I installed it anyways to see if the adhesion would keep the tear together and it barely sticks to the case. After opening and closing the case twice it began to fall off. Save your money and purchase another brand.
2,One my 2nd use the 1st set ripped & on my 3rd-4th use of the 2nd set it ripped
4,I only used my AirPods pro like 5 times and the dust guard has some how already chipped
1,Great idea and concept. Poorly executed in my opinion.
1,Absolute pain to install instructions hard to follow with very basic no detailed pictures. As soon as I applied and tested fit one side ripped and now will not sit in place right. Waste of my time for waiting on them and money to buy
2,Broke the moment to put it in. Parts wouldn’t lay in right
5,I liked it a lot cause it minimizes the sound of the airpods when closing that anoying "tap"..
2,Was a little hard to stick on. The bottom piece has a little bump as it didn’t stick on 100%. It’s a good product to keep my AirPods clean but can be made a little easier to apply.
5,A+
4,Loved the easy installation of this model of dust guard compared to the normal AirPods.
1,The dust guard is ok... it doesn’t let me case close completely and i have cut my finger on the inner rim where the earbuds go... they could be betterUPDATE...Had ordered a second pair to replace the first... I thought maybe I installed them wrong or something but no... the second pair did the same thing... I kept getting little cuts on my fingers and the guard cut up my silicone covers for my buds. Big disappointment...
5,If you follow the instructions provided after purchase via email you’ll end up with this! Awesome!
1,I was really hoping this would be a great purchase as it really annoys me how the dust can build up on the case. However after a couple they started to come loose. Didn’t think much of it until it started slicing the silicone pieces on my AirPods. I’ve replaced the ear pieces and definitely will not be using this ever again.
1,Have not had this item even a month and it has ripped. They are cute and look great but not very durable. It was fairly easy to install but I work with vinyl allot. For those who do not then I can see it being a little tricky. Overall would not recommend seeing how quickly it ripped. Not worth the money.
2,The edges broke taking it off the clear film.
1,1. You can’t put the top and bottom one it won’t close2. Didn't last more then 5 days3. When it breaks it’s sharp and it’ll cutDon’t buy spend your money elsewhere. I have had them on for about 5 days now and they broke already. The plates are very thin and slice; I cut my finger on it cause the plate broke and snagged my finger tip. Also it comes with a top and bottom plate but you have to choose between the two because using both won’t slow the case to close properly
1,Well when I first started to try to put this together it was really confusing and the stickers were all facing the wrong direction the guide was confusing and well I managed to put it on it looked great it added a whole new look and I dig it but a week later it just started to fall apart not in a sense of it was coming off it was just coming off like breaking apart very brittle I honestly liked the product is just that it doesn’t work save your money and go somewhere else
4,Good
1,The concept is great but the directions are unclear and unless you get them absolutely straight they will overlap the opening for the earbuds and will get caught as you take the earbuds in and out.  As you can see in the picture both top and bottom have caught and ripped and have pealed up.  I expect that they will not last very long as they will continue to peal off.
1,I applied the label as described in the included instructions. After a few hours the metal tape started to peel and break off with opening and closing of the case. After a day and with so many flecks missing I peeled the remainder off.
1,This was just two stickers on the same clear piece of plastic. It was so hard to put them on my case. They made it look on the directions that they were on two separate pieces of plastic and thus really easy to apply onto your case.The stickers themselves show finger marks really easily so they don’t look nice.Then after a week the sticker got caught on something and ripped...so I ended up taking off the top sticker and keep the one around my AirPods on.Overall has to be something better out there.
2,Excited when I first got it but it was difficult to put on. And I’m just 2 days it ripped.
3,Rip easy and can be annoying asf to install
2,It was a hassle to get to the part and even worse to get it taped to the bottom. It ripped almost right away my headset came out with it sticking to it so I threw the bottom away
3,The installation process is not userfriendly at all.
1,Trying to get the plastic cover sheet off was a task in itself. Then trying to get it to stick to transfers plastic sucked and wasn’t sticking enough and ended up snapping thinnest part of the dust cover
1,I had to immediately discard of these due to them ripping during installation. I’m not sure if there was a monumental quality oversight but I couldn’t figure out if the “guide” I was supposed to transfer to was the plastic piece covered in writing severely inhibiting it’s usefulness as a “guide” or the piece it was already on which was incredibly difficult to position properly.
2,It looks cool at first and definitely protects from dust and scratches but after like a week or 2 it starts to break and tear. Eventually the whole thing just breaks with little sticker pieces still attached to the inside.
1,This product is absolutely the worst thing ever. It doesn’t stick properly. It’s super hard to align. Even with the alignment sticker if you are off by a fraction of a millimeter the whole thing is useless. The AirPods will catch on the sticker ripping it and possibly cut someone. And that’s if you even get it on. In my case I could only get on one sticker before the other one broke into two pieces. These are literally just two pieces of laser cut foil with adhesive on it. Too delicate!
2,When I went to apply using the instructions they provided it ripped so easily and wouldn’t stick properly.
2,Man this was an absolute nightmare for me to install. I ended up breaking one of them so I just keep on on the bottom but you guys need to put an easier installation setup I’m for this thing. Way to thin and fragile
5,You need good eyes and need to take your time to really align these properly when installing these.  I still didn't get them 100% lined up but pretty darn close LOL  So far they're staying on just fine and look nice.
5,On top of quality it has a cool look
5,It’s super hard to install but just follow the directions religiously and you’ll get it!Amazing look to the case and makes everything so much easier to clean. I got these because I’ve seen what AirPods look like without them and yeah I’ll pay extra to make wiping off ear wax dust and dirt easier.
1,Not exactly sure what happened but like half of it came off- I use my AirPods for the gym and sweat gets on them- I assume that could’ve done it.. but either way they should be able to withstand microbes of human oil..
2,Durability is terrible the bottom sticker ripped on the first day after opening the case for the second time after installing.
5,Not bad it worked for me ... we’ll see how long it holds .. but for now it’s good
1,Avoid this piece of junk.This is nothing more than a flimsy scrap of metal that will do nothing. The product says it’s to help with the magnetic pull from your AirPods but the product is metal. Installation is a pain because of the magnets. Incredibly cheap for the price includes one set the “guide” sticker didn’t work at all for me because the metal piece stuck to the wrong side when removing it leaving me to have to pick it out and try to manually install.
1,Update: less than a week & the top guard broke when i tried to align it the right way to avoid it further damaging my ear tip.It made a small cut on my airpod’s ear tip & scratched the stem a little.
1,First of all I ordered a gold and on the box it said gold however they were silver. Second the adhesive does not stick at all with the ridiculous instructions. Third they aren’t even shaped correctly no matter which way i tried to put them one side was always hanging over where it wasn’t supposed to be. I’m glad I could get a refund bc this WAS NOT WORTH IT
1,Not only was it unreliable as far as correctly lining up across the AirPod product’s seam so as to protect it like it writes and claims to do — I couldn’t possibly see how it would do more than be a glare of a sticker that’s cut as to perfectly shape the inner lining of the product of the upper and bottom lid but not actually cover the seam that it claims is in so dire need of protection and is allegedly designed to do so. It doesn’t fit.
5,I dont know why so many reviews are 1 star. either they received defective ones or they just dont have the steady hands or patience to put these on. I just watched the youtube vid on how to apply it and its perfect. no trouble on my side. Good product!
2,It’s a nice sticker. Just be really careful when putting it in it breaks easily. check the picture. Don’t buy it it’s a waste of money. Broke the next day. It’s a very fragile sticker.
1,The main thing that i don't like about the case is the the lid has came of a few time which means that one day i will lose it and i don't like that. The lid should have been attach to the case so that way i wouldn't  come off. Since it has a lynand I connect it to my belt loop. I do like the case I just don't like how the lid comes off so easily. I would not recommend this product for that reason.
2,Not so easy to install and they are very thin so when removing AirPod pros after installing the dust guards they are prone to catch the sides of the dust guards causing them to rip.
1,I had this product for my 1st pair of air pods..and the samething happened ..the bottom ticket was a mess to get on and to keep on without touching the air pods when taking out are putting in.  I was able to get the top piece on my 1st pair after several tries..so I thought to give them a try with the pros..and same thing..bottom piece was rubbing the pods when taking out and putting in..then the top portion did the same thing ..except this time it ripped...
1,They looked great and I would of kept them but it wont close with a protective case. U can squeeze it closed but it doesn’t stay closed. So I had to remove it. Maybe it would work without a case.
5,Does the job. A little difficult to put on but that may have just been me? It does come with some instructions on how to put it on. Overall a good buy.
2,While trying to apply this on my AirPods the guard easily snapped as I slowly took it off the sheet. I had no problem with my previous guard on my first pair of AirPods.
1,I don't like this product. I bought it to protect it from dust in my airpod pro but I feel like it doesn't really do much at all. It was quite hard to install it tore up during installation. It looked nice after all said and done but be aware!!! It made easier to open after I put it on ended up losing my left piece. It costed me $89+tax in order me to replace the missing left piece. I peeled it right off after the incident. Waste of my money
2,Dislike how when opening AirPod case the product started to lift and had sharp edge feel as well as the product lift up and broke while stuck to AirPod case.
2,Started peeling off the same day
5,Absolutely love these dust guards! They’re very durable they look great and they were super easy to install (using the install guide)! I highly recommend the Elago Dust Guards!
3,Installation is very hard
1,This product was very complicated to place. It broke 3 times.... I can still use it but I'm ocd and it drives me crazy.. not worth getting.
2,it was easy to install and it looked great but after just 1 week of use it got darker in some parts as if it had rusted
2,Not impressed they lasted about a month of being installed on my AirPods somehow 2 pieces broke off of both sides. 2 stars because install was straight forward and easy. Cannot add photo for some reason.
2,Already broke on one of the thinner areas.... good idea but needs to be better.
5,This is my second time buying them. They help by keeping clean the inside of the case.
5,This is a genius idea. I’ve had this on my AirPods case for over a week and so far it’s a great experience.
2,I followed all the instructions and it still ripped. The steps aren't as easy shown in the video. I'm very displeased in the way it came out on my case. I will be reaching out to elate
1,I wanted to like this product however that was not the case. It was hard to install and I doing so one of the corners stuck to the flat edge inside the case. When I attempted to carefully peel it off it ripped!
2,Elago offers the best dust guard I’ve seen however this product is still very difficult to apply. The instructions are confusing and maybe it’s just me but it seem the guards don’t cover the whole intended area.
5,It fit just right and looks really nice. It took me a few tries to put it on correctly but once I did it looked awesome.
5,Excellent product and does exactly what it’s intended for. Had the Gen 1 AirPods and they were very hard to keep clean but with this product I have not had one single issue or dirt with my new AirPods! Highly recommended!
2,Instructions were very unclear. Tried to understand them as much as possible but ended up messing up the installation and the protectors snapped in half. Would like to see better installation instructions.
1,I'll give 1 star because I can't give less. Don't spend your money on something that is impossible to install correctly. Look for any other solution but don't buy this product unless you want to lose your money.
2,It ripped while putting it on and i didn’t put force to it or anything! This is ridiculous!
5,Difficult to put on recommended watching the instruction clip a few times. Once on it’s very durable.
1,The dust guards broke after a couple of days of me using them there was a rip in the part that goes on the bottom. I trusted the company because I used their dust guard’s on my old pair of AirPods and they held up great but these were just terrible.
2,Watched the video on how to install the dust guard and did exactly as the video told me to do. Still I couldn't even get one of the guards on without ripping it. For $10 I couldn't be more disappointed.
1,I read the instructions and tried to peel off the dust guards using the clear plastic sheet and it did not stick to the sheet so i had to put it on hand. After finally doing that the top one didn’t even stick onto the case and now is broken off. Super cheap and not easy to assemble.
2,As soon as I opened the package the instructions were unclear on how to apply. This led to the product being damaged and installed incorrectly.
4,Very hard to get it just right
1,This product is very fragile I took my AirPods out of the case and clipped the guard and it tore. It’s also hard to install and I cut my self twice from it be careful when using this product. Better to just leaving it off.
5,This was easy to install good value for the money. Thickness is great my case closes as normal.
1,Those product suck so bad. They messed up my apple AirPods Pro case. When I try to stick them down because they come loose again and again I push one wrong direction and I break the lid just enough to throw the thing off and not close exactly right. So now I am totally screwed.
2,Hella hard to put on. When I finally got it lined up. I closed the airpods and when I opened them the guards were broken. Not worth it.
5,Se adhiere muy rápido
5,Si
1,Once I opened it out of the box the material ripped. The material feels like some cheap aluminum. Also they are magnetic so when attempting to align it the material would always go off-center. I eventually gave up and threw it away. Waste of money.
4,All in all is acceptable compared to its price
2,Less than twelve hours of having it on they ripped. Might have taken the AirPods out 3 times. They look nice and were easy to put in but did not last whatsoever.
1,Never have I been more dissatisfied with a product purchased through Amazon. This product caught my eye because there are very few of its kind. While attempting to install I realized that product quality is very poor and instructions are very unclear. I would rate this product a 0/5 if possible. If it were possible I would have attempted to resolve this issue directly with the seller. It appears as though you cannot contact them AT ALL. Do NOT purchase.
5,I used this item on my AirPod pros and it was definitely worth getting great company to purchase from and excellent customer service!!!!
1,This product is a rip off. I received it today and I tried to install it. First the print size on the directions was so small I could not read it. Second the directions were not clear: both my wife and I spent 20 minutes try to decipher them. Third I could not get the product to line up with my Air Pods Pro case. Fourth the bottom par tore and I cut my finger. This product is a joke. Do not buy it.
5,Product went on smoothly glad to find this product. Hopefully it will prevent issues with the magnets getting dirty/worn in the future.
5,Perfect fit and easy install use adhesive sticker to make install easier
5,Hides the dust well
1,The instructions are incredibly vague there is no way to tell what the guide is or how to install it. Claims easy installation but one of the guards tore immediately. I do not recommend buying this product complete waste of money
1,Instructions are vague and incorrect with missing steps. After a long battle getting them on they almost immediately fell back off. I was very excited and was immediately disappointed.
1,I was looking for something that would help keep dust and dirt from getting on my AirPods case but this item doesn’t do the job. It didn’t adhere well and when I took it off the sharp edge cut my finger.
1,First day it got a metal bit stuck on it. I wiped it off and the cover came off with it like it was nothing. Metal shavings get stuck in all the places it doesn't cover and makes it harder to clean. I don't recommend at all if you work in a place that's prone to having metal shavings. Putting the sticker on was kinda a pain. It seemed like they shipped it backwards on the plastic or I'm just that dumb.
2,I like the product but the adhesion is not so great. Multiple areas of the dust guard has tore and started to peel off
1,Huge waste of money this product has the worst application process I have ever seen don’t waste your money on this your better off buying an air compressor and getting the lint and dust by spending 5 minutes cleaning it out rather than using this product. Lesson learned -10/10.
2,I love the idea. Just very disappointed on how it broke on me so quickly (not even 10 minutes after putting it on) is
2,It's great I loved it... then it broke.I had it for 2 months and had to take it off because it was falling apart.
2,This item was difficult to adhere on to my AirPods case and in trying to do so it cracked because it’s so delicate.
1,This is so incredibly difficult to install on the new airpod pros it doesn't matter how careful you are they rip! They don't come with detailed instructions so I had to look up an instructional video (which wasn't even on the manufacturer's website). I did everything they said to do yet they still ripped almost immediately. Unless you don't care about the quality or having tears then don't waste your money. They also prevent the case from closing flush.
2,Extremely difficult to install. Once installed I noticed my AirPod case did not close properly as it did before. Everything was aligned perfectly but still wouldn’t shut completely. Disappointed.
1,More trouble than it is worth!!! Installation is nearly impossible to do perfectly. The sticker guide to help you place them on correctly does not help at all. The guide sticker is too big to align them for installation. I eventually gave up and just threw them in the trash.  Do not buy!!!
2,It was bad the bottom dust thingy was damaged the top one was good
1,Purchased to make it stand out. Lasted less than a week. Sections of it started to break off making it look tacky. It’s brittle not durable and a complete waste of money. Oh and sucks to apply. Not recommended sorry!
5,No sirve en absoluto se ensucia rápido y quedan huellas
2,It broke a few days into having it. A little piece just broke off. I installed it correctly but it didn’t hold up.
1,I level of precision required to snap these in place is very high. I ended up cutting my fingers on its sharp edges. I am sorry to have bought these for I removed it within 15 minutes and had small cuts (no blood just the top layer)  on my fingers.
2,It didn’t last as long as I thought it would unfortunately
2,Great product and looks great in place. Hard to install because the stickers are magnetic. After a couple of months of use it started breaking at the thin points.
5,Le da un toque de elegancia a los Airpods  pro.  Fue un poco difícil ponerlo solo que hay que tener paciencia.
5,Love it!!! Don’t have to worry about particles everywhere.
1,At first I thought it was a great purchase but then as I tried to attach it to my airpods it would not stick to the case it kept falling off and snapping in half. I bought a second one thinking it would go differently but it did not. The dust guard broke right in half the second I attached it to my case. Do not buy. I wasted $20 on absolute garbage.
5,Very easy to place and very good looking
1,I would not recommend this product. I tried to follow the instructions. I could not figure out how I was suppose to put their sticker on the provided plastic card. This should be done for us. We should not have to transfer the cut out from one piece of plastic to another. This ripped and is not aligned due to this issue. Do yourself a favor and do not purchase this.
2,The damn thing sliced my finger . It’s metal so the magents throw it off and as I was trying to adjust it it cut me
2,Sticker came off in places. Did not last.
2,Application wasn’t bad they didn’t stick and one already broke
5,Worth the price!
1,The product arrived promptly. Putting the guards in place was a bit tricky. I had to cut the plastic very close to the guards in order to place them properly. After on week of use I noticed the guard is not staying in place even though I cleaned with alcohol to ensure a clean surface to adhere to.Update : after just a week of use this product is breaking apart.
1,I didn’t care for this item. It was very difficult to install. I resorted to using tweezers to try to help but with no luck. Ended up tearing so I threw it away. Complete and utter waste of money and my time!
5,Great added protection. I thought I was going to mess up but it’s easy to install.
1,Absolutely worst time trying to install this. First off the installation video made it look simple. Stake the sticky side of the film and lay it over the stencil lift apply remove sticky film.  Mine the sticky side of the film would not lift the stencil OFF. I tried everything and it just wasn’t strong enough to lift it!  Finally tried peeling it off and it broke and went into the trash.
1,Do not buy I had the gold one it never rusted but this rose gold rusted the next day and nothing was even moist. Waste of $$$
2,The guard is basically a metallic paper. It is extremely fragile and hard to install. Mine broke on the first installation step. Totally not what I expected.
1,Great Idea for a product. It adds some coolness when you open up and see the metallic finish. Followed the video guide and it still took like 15 minutes to position them correctly with no overhang. Lasted about 8 hours before the first piece broke off. Would like to have another set but probably not worth the money if it isn't event going to last a day. Very disappointed.
5,These were pretty simple to install and give the case a unique look.
2,Super hard to put on and the guard very easy to break. Leaves the AirPods case a little left open. And doesn’t make sense.
5,The dust guards are very durable and made of a strong metal
5,The included instructions didn't make sense to me. Watching the how-to video on the product page was what I followed to successfully install the dust guards and I'm overall satisfied with my purchase.
2,These were difficult to apply to the my AirPod case and ripped super easily
5,I liked how easy the install was with help of the YouTube video. I like the color that is came in.
2,Installation is a pain! If you don’t line it up just right your AirPods won’t charge or get scratched up by the foil type guard.
1,i was trying to take them out the same way it showed and they broke
1,The first time I ordered this product it wouldn't stick to the case so I had to get a return. Once the return showed up It did stick. Less than a week later it has already started to peel off and even the back right corner tore off completely. Wouldn't recommend this product
2,Se despega fácilmente
1,Horrible product! After getting this replaced a couple times I finally got it on without tearing. Now after a couple days of enjoying it I noticed it is carving my AirPods near the sensor area! This film is extremely sharp and will cut your investment. Not worth your time and money.
1,Just a terrible product. I can put on screen protectors on phones & iPads with no dust…this was a joke. The product tore just trying to put it on. Then another part tore as I was taking my AirPod Pro out of the case.Very brittle. Stay away.
1,I was very happy to use this product but when I tried to do the "Simple easy process" it would not even barely stick on there and when I pulled it off the thing snapped! I do not recommend this product at all.
1,I do not recommend to purchase this product. I haven’t even had it installed for a month and it’s already ripping from the corners. I take really good care of my AirPods and I keep them clean that is why I bought this product but it does not work. I bought the rose gold dust guard and it’s starting to get like black rust on it.
5,This is a great accessory for air pods. It works perfect to keep dust from getting down in the case. Also the adhesive holds very well.
5,Bought dust guards from Elago for my AirPods 2 and AirPods Pro. Great product and definitely does what it advertises. Installation takes some practice so definitely buy two pairs if it’s your first time buying them because you will 100% tear the first pair.
1,Very difficult to install because they are so small in order to fit the case.  Also crappy instructions provided.  I tore mine so I never put them on - threw them away.  A waste of money and time!!!
2,broke immediately and is extremely fragile for $10
5,Tell you the truth I don’t know if these really keep dust out but it is aesthetically appealing.
1,Buyer beware. Installation is difficult as you trying to line up the liner in a very tight spot. The worst part about this is the sharpeness of the product. The lining makes it difficult to extract AirPods without cutting fingers. Very sharp.Last thing is on durability. The liner is coming off and breaking off (it’s made of metal) after 3 days on.Disappointed
2,Bottom sticker was impossible to apply. Top sticker lasted about two weeks before tarnishing and chipping. Save your money
5,Why all the bad reviews? Just put these on my airpods and they give the case a whole new look!! I just gotta be a tad bit careful when installing. But overall I’m pleased and they look great.
1,Do not waste your money on this. The “sticker guide” wasn’t sticky and this “gold” (def only looks gold in certain light)part- it bent while I was peeling it off the plastic and this thing is thin as paper feels like tin foil and now it’s bent and not protecting anything from dust. What a joke
1,Don't waste your money on these. Ripped after the second time i closed the case.  Leaves a small gap in the case when closed. Had to take them off of the case due to the gap. So they lasted less than 5 minutes on the case. Watch the video to install these if you do purchase these. Defiantly takes patience to install these.
1,This product is basically two very thin aluminum sticker. It’s very hard to install and does not fit and align well to your AirPods Pro. Mines basically came off after a day. Don’t waste your money
2,Does not fit perfect edges will scratch you’r AirPods due to it being aluminum type of material and having a sharp edge
5,But you have to check the manual before put this on your airpods!!
1,To start they don’t “perfectly fit” like they claim. When you have these installed the AirPods case doesn’t close all the way. Additionally they ended up hanging off after merely a week and to top things off the sliced my finger open when I went to finish uninstalling them! Maybe they’ll work for you but they didn’t work for me.
2,I installed it and went to take my headphone out and it ripped and was ruined. The very first time. Do not recommend
5,All those people who put bad reviews did not watch the You Tube video go and search up Eloago AirPods Pro. And it won’t be a problem but you must have hand’s of a suregon. Great product but not for the price. :)
2,Ripped after application very thin not durable.
2,Rips easily and breaks apart in the actual case
1,Came in damaged (looked like a cut on the bottom part decided to deal with it because I thought it was stick good...WRONG!) A piece ripped off win peeling off the film Came off and crinkled within the third or fourth usage of the AirPod Pro case
5,Excellent product stopped the build up of dusk and debris
2,Dustguards would not stick to AirPods case
1,Top piece basically impossible to line up properly. You have to do it the first time or you lose adhesive. And then it ripped anyway after one day. And I am very careful about opening and removing my AirPods. Looks really cool for one day but after that it is sure to break and you’ll be upset you wasted the money.
1,Way too difficult to get these on. I bought three. Ruined two of them while trying to get them on. Planning on returning the one I have left. Don’t waste your money on these.  I have installed phone and watch screen protectors and was expecting some difficulty but this is not even reasonable.
5,👍
2,It tore before the adhesive had even connected. This product is a rip off. Definitely not worth the money.
5,Durability
2,They are hard to put on. Once I got it lined up right it ripped. Wish I could get another set of them.
1,These are not worth the money.  They were difficult to install and one side broke upon installation.  I tried contacting the company to send another pair and they did not.  I thought for the price they would be higher quality.  In the future I would order the cheap $2 ones from China because I’m pretty sure they are the same thing.
5,Really awesome!
5,Definitely money’s worth
1,They broke before I could even get them on my AirPods and weren’t the color they showed in the picture do not recommend
1,These things are the flimsiest "guards".  After trying to apply them for 15 or so minutes I gave up.  One buckled and subsequently lost its stickiness.  The other side one I got applied but it didn't fit accurately.  Then while trying to adjust its fit it also buckled.  The whole bloody mess is in the garbage now.
5,Great Product
5,Weary to install love the color adds pop to the bland EarPods boring white case!!
2,Did not stay on.
1,Literally the worst product. When I put it on I was careful to align it perfectly but some spots weren’t sticky!! So within 20 minutes those spots RIPPED!  This product is truly awful! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY... turns out my brother had bought one too and had the exact same issue😡
1,I should've listened to the reviews before buying. The product is real fragile and tricky to install. Save your money and dont buy this. I am really disappointed. I even watch a youtube video of the installing it and i did follow it step by step but the product still didn't do its job.
5,It was not easy to install like the video shows you. Basically almost broke the pieces because they don’t come off the plastic film. But I got it done taking them out by hand one by one
1,Worse product i have ever purchased on Amazon. It’s almost impossible to line up on the case correctly and breaks way too easily. The one for the Air Pods 1-2 is ok but for the Air Pods Pro i do not recommend this product
5,When opened ir came out it doesn't want to stick
5,It’s a little challenging to apply but once you follow the instructions to the T you should be fine wonderful product 👍🏽.
5,It worked great keeped all the dirt out of my case.
1,I was incredibly unimpressed with this product. I followed the video directions to the letter but still it managed to not align properly. Instead for the two hours that it was on my AirPod case every time I reached in for them I cut my finger. Not cool. Not sure if I can return but I will definitely try.
1,The product started to break after 1 month of moderate use the strips are very thin and the glue is not enough to keep them glued to the case
2,It ripped on the 2nd day
2,it keeps peeling of my AirPods.
1,Completely frustrating installation.  The product might be okay but they DO NOT HAVE a simple and easy installation method.  The instructions are terrible.  Do not buy these.
1,I thought this was a great idea I concept but I was wrong. I really really wanted to like this product. Installing wasn’t to difficult as long as you take your time. The bottom piece broke after the second day. Super sharp product. If your not careful you will cut your pods or worse cut your finger.
5,little hard to apply straight but one i got it it’s good
2,It was extremely difficult to put on. Once I had the product on my AirPods... THEY PRODUCT TORE IN HALF!
5,Love this it serves a simple purpose but really improves the AirPod experience.
1,The adhesive needs to be better. I put these on 3 days ago and it’s wearing off.  The AirPods coming out of the case will almost always run on the edge when they are pulled out of the case. This didn’t stand up to the wear and tear.
1,Did not cleanly stick to my AirPods case and scraped the corners of the pods because it didn’t sit in the correct spot no matter how many times I tried to place it.
5,Great
1,They are 2 stickers...its sad you have to pay a premium for such a small upgrade. And as far as dust guard? Come on it doesnt stop dust it just collects on top of a sticker now....Visual upgrade only.Update: within less than a week the top already ripped. Returning it waste of time and money
5,I like it does it's job
1,Not worth the 9 dollars. A section ripped off within the first week or two. It’s a cheap sticker that’s not worth your money.
1,it didn’t even stick to my airpod pro case
1,i bought this for my aipods and it ripped as soon as i took it off the sheet they product should be more durable.
2,It broke off after a week
2,No clear cut directions. Cut size is slightly off so AirPod pro’s hit them causing them to break easily
1,Was worth the money.... they would stick and then automatically peel off after you close and re-open the case. They we easily peeled off and messed up my case. But if I could get my money back for 2 of them I would. DO NOT BUY THESE!!!
5,Keeps the device clean and safe from dust and particles
1,Everything is broke the box and the product. Absolutely pissed this is the second order from you guys with this issue
1,Horrible product. It did not work and the directions were incredibly unclear. Just clean your AirPods case with a cotton swab on your own. Don’t waste your money on this product. I never leave bad reviews but this one warrants a bad review.
1,Product had a piece chipped off after 2 days. I've only taken my airpods out of my case once since I've applied the dust guard. Application was difficult even with their tutorial. Very expensive for something that breaks after 2 days and does not come with spares or replacements.
1,Disappointed with product received rose gold when i ordered black. Broke upon first time i put them inThey are attracted to the magnets and they’re basically Cut from a sheet of thick aluminum foil. So thick that it doesnt let you close your case right without accidentally crushing them thus causing them to snap.
1,After a month and a half the product failed Due to poor construction first thoughts were that it was innovative and worth the purchase that would still stand if only the product was durable.
2,Not very durable at all
1,put them on like the instructions said and after a couple of days they started breaking off every time i would pull out my air pods so just took them off and threw them away would not buy again
5,Great! Works as intended!
1,Was excited to receive this and when it arrived it was the wrong color. I figured it wasn’t that big of a deal - so I installed it and less than 3 weeks it chipped off and wouldn’t adhere properly. Disappointed to say the least. I guess you get what you pay for.
1,I was very disappointed with this product it didn’t fit properly before it was useless I would like to have my money back
5,Day and night different. Highly recommended
1,la parte superior pego bien y calzó exacto pero la inferior no calza bien al sacarlos airpods los bordes se despegan y termina rompiéndose como se ve en las fotos
1,It is not as easy as it looks and a mm off and it’s worthless. Case won’t shut and had to remove. No chance of recovery after taking it off.
1,I’m going to chalk it up to user error but I cannot instal these to save my life. I have tried three different pairs and they tear on me everytime. They seem like a great product but I can’t get them to work. Figured I would share my experience so people are aware.
5,I bought for son. He is satisfy. Reliable and durable.
2,lasted less then a week
1,Installation was easy enough but the case won’t close all the way. Less than 24 hours after install one half has torn and rendered the kit useless. Be careful as this is sharp and if any piece comes off it will cut you or worse get in your ear.
1,Es lo peor que he podido comprobar por Amazon eso no funciona trae poco pegamento y se cae al instalarlo es una basura no lo recomiendo
1,I have a few elago products and this is the least of their quality. Flimsy material a terrible install process that is too finicky and delicate. GREAT IDEA - poor execution. Hardly even worth returning because they are so disposable and mine are already snipped where they weren't perfectly aligned and the airpods case snipped them.
5,Too flimsy they came apart while taking them of their package.
1,It didn’t not come off of where it comes and when it did it broke before even installing.
2,Extremely difficult to install.Started flaking off after a few days. Had to remove
1,Se rompió al primer intento de despegarlo la mitad se quedó en el adhesivo y la otra mitad se rompió no vale la pena
1,This product would not stick and when it did it made it very hard to close the case
1,Cheap and tore during the attempted installs and the same for my other 5 sets of AirPod cases.  I’d rather just every few months clean out the case with q-tips and a wipe or two
5,Easy to install; finger prints show easy but easily can be wiped with a micro fiber cloth; would love to see a matte version; does its job and protects while giving the AirPods Pro a sleeker look
5,I always Buy this brand and I love it. Have to have a steady and gentle hand to apply though!
2,It hasn’t even been a week and it’s already cracking and coming off.
2,Cover did not adhere well at all. AirPods started to tear the cover.
1,They rusted in the span of 3-4 weeks. It’s a horrible look and it just looks dirty. Now I’m having trouble removing the dust guard. It is very secure and I’m afraid it will scratch on damage my AirPods. So now I’m literally stuck with this rusted guard.
2,The thing literally broke on me. One side stood the other just ripped in 3.
5,Goog
1,There was almost no adhesive to any of it... the guide sticker would not stick to the dust guard so I had to peel it off and that almost ruined it and then it wouldn’t stick to the case. I ended up having to just throw it away.
5,Very easy to install and they look great!
1,Absolute waste of money when I peeled it off the plastic it ripped. And every time I tried to apply it it got attracted to the magnets in the case and would not stay where it was supposed to. Try it if you want just don’t expect much
1,Worked great for about two hours then it stopped being sticky and ended up being more of a problem then a solution
1,The product is impossible to get off the sticker pad and onto the AirPods. They were very fragile! One tore as I tried to remove from pad.
1,This is utter garbage. The “guide sticker” is backwards making it impossible to install per the directions. Without the guide sticker the actual dust covers fall apart in your hands. Total waste of money. Wish I would have heeded the other reviews.
5,Just follow the video instructions and youll be good
5,Price
1,Don’t waste your money. This sticker is first of all very hard to put on without is breaking. It doesn’t protect or cover the surface completely and leaves sharp edges that could potentially cut.
5,It is nice
5,Good to have so as to keep the dust and grime from soiling the AirPod pro which is a problem to clean out without scratching or damaging the AirPod case
1,Bottom line wouldn’t stick to the correct side of the plastic so I tried to loosen it up so I could stick it to the guide plastic but it broke still tried even with the broken spot then it just broke more. Got the lid part on
5,Easy to use:)
1,This product seemed like a good idea seemed to be durable.  When it came to adhesion I followed the steps and this thing does not stick.  Seemed like every time I grabbed my pods the product would come up with it.  Seems inefficient.
1,Cheap and tore during the attempted installs and the same for my other 5 sets of AirPod cases.  I’d rather just every few months clean out the case with q-tips and a wipe or two
1,I bought this item for my grandson. I applies it for him to make sure it was done right. After a couple of days the bottom started peeling up and had to be removed and thrown away. The top one is still intact.
2,Did it’s job for about a week then they fell off.
5,I love this dust guard fits perfectly and closes perfectly no gaps only think I should’ve done was read the instructions but thankfully I got it on they look beautiful a new dark grey shine
5,if you hate seeing your AirPods Pro Dirty from the inside this is the item you need Dust Cover. Easy to install. Happy I found this on amazon
1,The durability of this product is terrible.  I receieved and installed this product last night. Installation seemed to go smoothly for the most part. This morning woke up ready to make call grabbed my AirPods put the right one in and immediately felt a sharp pain in my ear. Part of the dust grabbed attached to the AirPod and cut the inside of my ear. No easy way to reach out to the seller to address this problem so this scathing review is what is necessary.
1,Instructions were impossible to follow. The sticker has already completely flaked off and it’s only been a couple weeks. Good idea but the execution of this particular product is poor.
1,I expected a good quality dust guard but I instead got a bunch on tiny metal pieces in my fingers ears and AirPods Pro. Easy application and all but absolute trash of durability. Within 3 days the entire hinge area had chipped away. Absolutely horrible product.
2,Didn’t like that my case didn’t close evenly after applied... I scrapped it!
1,Bottom protector is very hard to apply using this. When I finally did get it on it bottom part caught on case when I opened it and pulled and broke. Top portion of protector still ok. Not happy with application included.
5,Elago sent over a video instructions to add to the easiness of installation. The dust guard has held up well on my recent trip to Hawaii. It doesn't peel off or seen any tears.
5,Excelente producto
1,Not even worth spending the little change as soon as you try to use it to put into your case it breaks it is stain as hell not worth the time or the money get some Q-tips some peroxide or alcohol and clean them yourself
1,Doesn’t fit right constant sharp edge on inside of both sides so AirPods catch white taking them in and out. Wouldn’t be bad if it fit right
1,Broke within a week of using it. Reached out to them via email and sent them a picture to get no response. Was great when first installed but now is torn and useless.
1,I put the product on almost perfectly fitting. The first issue I noticed is that the case didn't close like it used to. Then the next day some of the parts started breaking off and falling off the case just by opening the case.
2,The sticker just came off after a couple weeks
2,Hard to install and eventually chip off
1,What a joke this is literally just a sticker are you kidding me a sticker that makes a case desperate description is completely in accurate and makes you think that you were getting a offbrand charging case that has dust proof resiliency what a crock
1,Would not go on right and the top piece was ripped. Waste of money!
1,It’s incredibly difficult to get these covers off the plastic sheet they come on without ripping them. Despite following the instructions word for word both of them ripped.  For something containing metal you would think they’re made of thin paper. Not even remotely worth $9.
5,it’s like a shinny silver and it covers the spots where dust and dirt get
1,This gives the worst install instructions ever. First the wrong side peels off when you you are opening it to put it on the guide sticker so the cover sticker just got stuck on the guide then the second one ripped. Not worth the 10$ for a couple stickers
5,Looks good
5,Had in for two weeks and no signs off debris or build up
5,It breaks too easily
1,It was too delicate and not easy to install. Even creating a space at the opening.Had to peel it off an throw away. Worng decision.
5,Pretty good product I’m glad I bought it it has worked amazingly to keep dust off the AirPods case 10/10
1,It doesn’t stick very well and it ripped already the first day I got it from the top cover
1,Looked nice in the box absolutely impossible  to install. I have installed a LOT of screen protectors vinyl wraps etc. instructions didn’t make any sense and I was unable to install these properly as once you attempt to remove them to re align they tear/pinch. Would not buy
5,Se mantiene perfecto con el uso diario cumple con todo lo descrito.
1,Started falling off after a week of having it not worth it
5,Easier to out in than I thought and they look amazing.
2,Very low instructions and it breaks easily.
1,This dust guard is a ridiculously expensive super thin sheet of metal that doesn’t even come with a second pair in case you mess up the first time. After a grueling installation I later found that it was leaving visible scratches on my AirPods. Angrily returned immediately.
1,Difficult to install and the instructions provided was poor.
1,I really wanted to like these.  The dust guards are so thin that putting them in place was near impossible. They tore in several places as I was installing making them useless. Into the trash they went. Save your money!
1,After 2 days I begin to notice a noise all because of the material that it carries makes the sounds evaporate it is not worth it
1,Unless product is put on exactly right (which is very hard since their application process is awful) it will break. Once it breaks it will be hard to get off. Lasted 2 seconds on my case and took me 30 minutes to get off.
1,Absolute pain to install I gave up.1st set I had ripped when I was taking out an AirPod with minimal force.2nd set I still couldn’t figure out the easiest way to install them. I gave up and requested a refund
1,Applying the sticker was pretty straight forward but the sticker peeled and broke off after 3 days of use. I used it and applied it as advertised.
1,El producto no venía con instrucciones para la instalación adecuada ek mio se rompió en 5 pedacitos... muy triste.  Luego vi en un video cómo se instala.Puede ser un producto bueno pero sin una adecuada instrucción de instalación para mi fue una pérdida de dinero.
1,There is only one picture on how to install and there is no way it can be done that way. I got it on finally but it ripped. It looks good but the install is the worse thing I have ever seen. Don’t waste your money.
1,They are not easy to install!  I have been with them for a short time and they were damaged just by closing the airpod case...
2,Laverda me arrepiento de la compra  se daño muy rapido.
1,LOW QUALITY. It didnt last long.. it even cut my skin.
5,Good
5,These are great be sure you line them up just right though or they will get hung on your finger and the rip the tape
5,Very useful
1,This was one of the worst products I have ever purchased. Even though the product is relatively inexpensive don’t wast your money. They have to be lined up Perfectly or they don’t work which is almost impossible to do with what they give you
1,Honestly. this falls more on Apple than these people. This product looks amazing on your airpod case until it starts to fall off piece by piece 2 weeks later. Apple needs to re-design the airpod case to not collect so much dirt in the creases.
2,It peels off after a week
2,it rips so easily and seems like it does nothing
1,Cons: Difficult to apply. Ripped top and bottom pieces upon application. After a few days more pieces began to break off and now it seems to be in place but missing parts.Pros: They refunded my money
1,Whatever genius decided that the dust guard should be METAL in a MAGNETIC case should get the Nobel prize
1,It does not come with airpods and it did not fit in mine
1,This is garbage.I had a lot of problems installing it.The top part was easy but the bottom part was pretty hard because it’s metal and kept bouncing off the magnets in the AirPod holder.DO NOT GET THIS
1,First time I couldn’t get it on. I saw the video. So they send me another on I didn’t follow the video since it didn’t work so i sprinkled a little water and installed it. It didn’t last. It tore as I take out my pods.
5,They are amazing noise canceling is really good and whenever you use them in transparency mode it’s like they’re not even there...
1,I was going to like these but they started to come apart. Now I’m just going to take them off and not use it at all. Stuck on the first time right. But after a week they’re coming off.Don’t waste you money.
1,Hard installing didn’t go on right it sliced my fingers up every time i put pods in and took them out!!!! They broke and ripped on there own That metal will cut u up be careful not worth the money at all!!!!
5,Broke a part as soon I took out of the box.
1,Broke 5 mins after I used it and the magnetic strip interfered with the case closing
5,Perfect
1,Garbage. Couldn’t even get the product to untuck from its packaging with its own instructions and how to video it was just simply stuck to the packaging. Didn’t even get the chance to make it work on my AirPods. What a sham of a product.
1,After a couple of days the dust guard ripped. Not worth the money I don’t recommend it
2,ripped in 2 days
2,The airpods case doesn’t close completely it leaves a little gap
1,When I installed them they were hard and wasn’t easy and when I took out my air pods it scraped them and when I pulled it off it cut my finger and it started to bleed.
1,I was so excited to install these and tried to be as careful as possible due to the other reviews. Unfortunately right after I installed them and took the headphones out the front portion just ripped. So disappointed that it didn’t workout.
5,This makes my AirPods Pro case stand out. Looks great!
1,Second set first set  fell apart putting it on this one’s on exactly and it’s cutting into my brand new headphones would not buy
1,This is a great idea. But they go on good but the adhesive sucks bad. Had them on for a couple of days then when pulling a bud out they rip. They’re too flimsy to work correctly.
1,Pealed and tore it about two weeks. If you need a dust gaurd your not babying the airpods. This film would need gentle use and extreme care to keep it intact. Avoid!
1,Didn’t fit good left a gap between cap and case
1,After having to order a second one I had the exact same issue after watching the installation video multiple times of not getting the dust guard to stick to my AirPods. I highly recommend not wasting your hard earned money on this product.
5,Muy fácil de instalar y el color es bello
1,I can’t even use these and wasted my money when I could’ve bought these from someone else.
1,Ripped very easily. It’s not worth it the magnets pulled the dust cover off and broke it after I opened my airpods a few times. Would not buy again.
1,Mine was hanging off the sticker and would not even adhere to my head phone case. Not worth 10$ more like 1$.
1,The product broke in multiple areas within a few days of purchase definitely not worth it.
1,This produce was terrible . Didn’t get the sticker off the backing it came on before it ripped. Never even got to put it on the case it was intended for . Flimsy and not worth a wooden nickel
1,Ripped right after install but it was only small and I was able to stick back down then not even a day later it ripped again in another spot and the whole thing just fell off. Do not purchase!
1,This product is too hard to install it never ever Lance right if you get it in the wrong position there is a sharp edge that scratches your AirPods and can cut your finger!
5,So if you get these take your time attaching it to the film & AirPods. I love the look.
1,This product broke instantly even after following all the instructions when you apply it it comes right off once you try to remove your airpods from the case.
1,Bottom dust guard was broken in package in two places poor design. And it’s a finger print magnet I will not be purchasing anything from this seller again and you shouldn’t either.
1,The installation instructions are confusing and if you’re not careful the foil breaks.  It’s very fragile and even if properly installed dust still gets in your buds.  Save your money
1,Easy to install installed correctlyit didn't even last 3 hours & it was already coming off and parts of it broke
2,Tore taking it off the paper
5,I love this product it fits perfectly and looks luxurious the customer support is amazing and I definitely recommend this product to others.
2,Not so good rooted right away
5,This product definitely keeps dust out and adds some bling. Cool
1,Made sure I cleaned the are with alcohol and let it dry so it could stick good and by the end of the day it was coming off and tore
5,I love this product and the seller is nice too
1,Was already broke when arrived. And fell apart when trying to put them on. After seeing what it was made of it was obvious that it was never going to do what it was supposed to anyways.
1,After 2 days I opened my car felt a sharp poke on my finger and when I looked at it it was bleeding pretty bad turns out part of the guard had broke and peeled up it gave me a jagged cut.
2,It breaks fast
1,Wow  I don’t like to write negative reviews but literally top 10 worst things I bought on amazon.Basically just threw $10 dollars on the trash along with these things that ripped while removing from the packaging
5,Very practical and cute! Elago also has a Youtube video that walks you through the process. Very helpful!
1,Did not stick right caused more trouble
1,Super hard to put on broke on the edges and always stayed nasty looking. Not worth the money.
5,it can protect iron dust
5,Good
5,Broke the second day of use doesn’t sick well
5,Purchased this for my daughter for her new AirPods. She loves it! So far it has met expectations
1,Was not worth it. Came off and began to tear after the 2nd day. I only use my AirPods for school. Would not recommend.
1,Very cheap and flimsy not durable at all.
1,I’ve had it on 5 seconds on my AirPods Pro case and they ripped while putting them on the case
1,Bought this in hope of protecting the seal around my airpod pros. Unfortunately it did not last and now there is a section missing after the first day.
5,I having receive this Prado can’t you call me at (718) 787-6027 asSoon as possible
1,Product arrived very fast and was a breeze to install. However not even a day later after install the bottom cover tore for no apparent reason. Durability is definitely not it’s strong suit. Would not buy again and would not recommend.
1,The product was easy to install but overall durability was terrible. I installed them in the night the next day by mid day there was a piece torn. It looks great but just a little better durability would of been better.
1,The product was too brittle and would be difficult to manage to apply to where I needed it to be and was troublesome and was not worth the money.
1,They didn’t work for one they were hard to put on and 2 they fell off within a month of having them if anything less
1,They where somewhat difficult to apply to the case. They don’t last very long and can catch or cut you while taking the AirPods out. They tear after a week or 2 overall not worth it
1,DO NOT BUY....Just got this item today and when applying it on my Airpods they ripped. Sensitive is not the word for this item. If I could give this item a (-1) I would. DO NOT BUY!
1,Product didn’t fit properly and came off within a couple of days.
1,Item was not realistic to install.  The cover also was not cut with any precision as it would overhang making contact with the airpods.  The adhesion was the biggest problem as it would not stay.
1,I followed the directions perfectly and even waited to open my AirPods for these to arrive.They lasted for about 10 minutes the top completely fell apart. Very disappointed
2,A pice of it broke
5,Took about 3-4 times using the soapy water trick once I got it all aligned it was perfect
1,It ripped almost instantly. It also didn’t seem to fit it was too small.
1,it’s garbage it came in silver even though i bought the gold plated version and it’s a huge pain to install it mine ripped in half trying to take it off the main sticker. WASTE OF MONEY
1,Difficult to apply and doesn’t stick well
1,I thought these were medal and that i was gonna take them out of the package and they were on a piece on paper. very disappointing they’re still in the package not used
1,flimsy and can rip easily mine lasted 2 days before the top part of the dust guards ripped
1,This is a horrible product.  The protector does not come off the plastic.  So once you manually get it off it rips.  Waste of $!  The video makes it look so easy but it’s not.
1,I was so excited to receive my new dust protectors. Until I realized what a piece of junk they were and the directions were not only unclear but stupid. Also the product itself was poor quality and a piece of garbage.
1,I have had the dust guard on for just over a day and almost half of it has broken off and because it is metal is now slicing my fingers when I take out my AirPods
5,It fits perfect on my AirPods Pro!
5,Really good product looks very nice
5,Took all of 5 minutes to line everything up. Very pretty.
1,It’s an aluminum sticker. Comes with very bad directions you’ll just end up messing up the sticker it’s not worth it waste of money just clean them with a cloth every once in a while
1,Terrible it came in with dust guard bent so I couldn’t do anything about ityou might as well just be giving away your money.Just regularly clean your AirPods and you wouldn’t even waste a dime
1,Literally ripped within 24 hours of installation and considering you only get one in a pack this was a complete waste of money :)
1,It’s literally just a freaking sticker
1,The side where the ear pieces seats  came off and tore after the third time I used my headphones. Very disappointing not going to pay for another one. Great idea poor execution.
1,Lasted a couple or days then it started to peel
1,I installed the dust guard onto my new AirPods Pro and after opening and closing it a couple of times I saw that the dust guard had already started to come apart. Save yourself $9 and don’t get them.
1,I’ve had dust guards on my AirPods 1 and 2 these are super thin and break super easy the material needs to be a bit thicker for them to be better wouldn’t buy unless they made it stronger very disappointed.
1,Very difficult to apply and felt like it would scratch my airpods pro’s so I ended up removing it.
1,Not a good adhesion. Every time I lift my AirPod out it pulls the dust guard with it and it tore within 24 hours of adhering it to my case.
1,The adhesion did not last long making the durability non existent. Basically ended up being a waste of money and time.
5,Watched the installation video; took me 5 minutes to install it carefully. Looks amazing when I open the case!
1,Didn’t stay. Started lifting every time I tried to open the case one of the thinnest sides snapped. I had to take them off. Not worth buying.
1,Not worth the money. Doesn’t fit properly
1,The installation process was kind of tricky and after instillation the sticker started to buckle in on itself and eventually shear. Some portions of it look okay still but not as pretty a sight I was hoping for.
1,I only had a week and it broke without force
1,It was very difficult to put on and broke
1,First one had to be replace.  Ripped.  Replacement cut my finger since it didn’t stick right.  Sharp aluminum.  Bad cut
1,Don’t waste your moneyExtremely difficult to put on.Made of brittle metal that breaksJust not worth itI don’t understand why they can’t ale it out of vinylWaste of oney
5,Cleaner look...too bad the AirPod pros itself sucks
1,If you don’t get it perfect in the first try don't try adjusting it it is extremely fragile and will literally crumble under the slightest pressure waste of money
1,Didnt stick came apart. Overall disappointing i work on cars and taught it was a cool idea to keep shavings from sticking to my airpods
1,Horrid.  The installation of these things makes it near impossible to get a good fit.  And nearly 10$ for something that should cost maybe 3$.  Nope.  Never again.  Waste of money.
1,There was gaps when I attached the product and when I tried to redo it the guard ripped.
1,I am gentle with my AirPods. This just didn’t hold up. Bummer
1,This is the biggest waste of money ever! Tore both of them trying to install them. Don’t waste your money!
1,Product adhesion do not last a month.. try to put it back but not work. After removal  a cut in finger was received. Looks good but don’t last. Waste of money.
5,Its nice but hatd to fit
1,Flimsy broke before I got them on then lid didn’t operate properly.
1,Wouldn’t fit and waste of money
5,Great product came in really fast
1,This thing is only $10 but the fact the it ripped within first week of use is pretty bad.
1,HORRIBLE product. broke for it was even on my airpods pros  and kept coming off . pointless and doesnt do the job  the color started fading and chipping the next day
5,Very nice I like that the surface of the opening doesn’t get messed up now
1,I hated this product poor quality and it is already coming off. I’ve had it on for a week and I will have to buy another one because it doesn’t not stick well.
5,Very discreet I had a hard time applying the product but definitely worth the buy.
1,Not a good product it ripe right off on first open after install
1,Trash already ripped and I just put it on yesterday.
1,I’ve applied many skins and other vinyl but this was the hardest to apply and I felt I could never get it right. I would have appreciated a second one as a backup.
1,Not recommended. Won’t snap close your Airpods Pro. Waste of money. Applied it for 5 minutes and threw it into dustbin LOL
1,Put it on as instructed and the bottom piece keeps peeling off. Peeled off to the point that it broke and doesn't even stick anymore. I wouldn't recommend buying this at all.
1,I watched several videos before buying this item.  It didn't last 2 months before the top portion tore on its own.  I wouldn't recommend these.  They also look tarnished already.
1,Just awful. Wait until some good companies come out with there.  First set lasted almost 24 hours. Then I cleaned the area even more and the second set lasted almost 36 hours before they started peeling off.
5,Good protection for AirPods Pro
1,Torn off within few days.
1,The adhesive was good but that’s about it.The template used was too small didn’t cover the outer surface of my AirPod pro all the way. If using be very careful because they rip easily.
1,They ripped as soon as I lifted them off the clear plastic. Unbelievable. I can’t believe I spent good money on these.
1,The adhesive is not told on which side it is. Breaks very fast. Not worth my money or time.
1,I don’t understand how I can buy other brands of dust guards for AirPods and they last me a lifetime but this one brand is way more and it breaks in an instant.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Very easy to install just watch the video. The color is very nice. So far it hasn’t shifted !
1,Not fitted to case overlapped edges… kkept coming off entry time i tookk earbuds out
1,package came in terrible condition and very difficult to i atal without breakingfollowed the instructions in video but was different from the product shown.
1,After only a week these dust guards are already falling apart. I’d suggest looking for something better. I purchased these bc someone on YouTube had recommended this brand. Also they’re not easy to install at ALL.
1,Not good quality. Instructions are very minimal. Both sides broke installing. Quality is not good. I do not recommend this item for the airpods pro. Not worth it. Had a very bad experience.
1,Was very hard to place and line up or to get to stick. Ended up not lined correctly and tore while trying to even apply it
1,I ripped some how while in the package
5,very good similar to the site
1,My dust guards ripped the day I got them. I wasn’t even able to use them it was a waste of money and if I could I’d get a refund
1,The product is not as good as advertised.  The adhesive eventually wears away.
1,This didn't last opened mt case today and a piece had broken off.
1,Peels off and breaks off into little pieces. No way this lasts. The fix is worse than the problem.
5,Thank you
1,This product is unsafe ! It cut myself when opening and my wife! Do not buy!
1,dont buy. poor adhesion. came out
1,Very difficult to align and install this product should come in a pack of three so you can at least have one to practice.  I had to remove it
1,Had this for two days before it started coming off don’t buy this
1,While i was trying to install the rim i glided my finger along the edge of it and it cut my thumb to the point where it started bleeding (like a lot).
1,This was such a waste of my time and money. The adhesive was horrible and the material was extremely thin. I would never buy this product again. I am highly disappointed.
1,Not strong or durable and definitely not worth the money ripped instantly as I removed the guard from the sticker sheet.
1,Ripped once placed because it didn’t stick
5,I like the way they fit and will protect my case.
1,Absolute hot garbageInstall is difficult even when following the directionsThe edges are super sharpFell apart within a week of usage
1,Not very happy with this product. Was very excited to install. But directions that are given aren’t working like in the video. Wouldn’t recommend
5,Fits nice doesn’t last long
1,Came broken waste of money and the adhesive sucks. Should’ve asked for my money back when I got it or returned it
5,Follow the video instruction and worked pretty well. You will need steady hands though.
1,Returning broke couldn’t even put on flimsy cheap should send like 3 replacements for this price like they for the wrap earbuds I bought
1,Product installation description invalid. It shows to attach the wrong side of the guide sticker which causes tearing of the product. Waste of time. Product also does not fit properly in the case!
1,It was hard to install and didn’t remain glued on. They are cute but not functional. I don’t recommend it.
1,The dust guards are horrible in my opinion. After viewing the video several times I tried putting them on. They did not stick to the AirPods at all. I will be seeking a refund.
5,Great product
1,Just a flimsy sticker that didn’t last.
1,Son as you put them on and close the door the dust hard would rip and I had to throw it away. Not real durable.
1,Bad size and hard to install
1,I saw the instruction Video multiple times.  The dust guard never stuck to the case as instructed.  Extremely hard to line up with the case.  Returned.
1,Poor quality poor design and very hard to put on correctly. Don't waist your money easier to just clean your case out once in a while.
1,They don’t stick at all... and once I took my air pod out after install it broke an came unglued from the case
1,It’s a metal sticker with the strength of tinfoil after install it started fraying with pieces being attracted to the magnets in the case. Complete waste of money I don’t recommend it.
1,The film didn’t last long. I didn’t get the stick right the first time. I tried to lift it up and the edge broke. Worst purchase ever.
5,Great product. Does what it says it does
1,The item started rising and broke almost immediately after having them.
1,they break easily and followed the instructions to put them on but it didn't work at all. waste of money.
1,This product is unsafe ! It cut myself when opening and my wife! Do not buy!
1,The protector came ripped on bottom portion
1,Already broken for the first time!!Very unsatisfied
1,No pegaba bien y se me rompió el primer día
1,Se despegó solo duro unos meses ahora no se ve bien pésima compra no lo recomiendo
5,Not easy to install but then it’s so perfect and elegant
1,Was a waste of money for it to easily rip apart.
1,After a day of having these [properly] installed the foil snapped. This product is totally garbage. Got worse from the pic I left here. Garbage!
1,I wouldn’t really call these dust proof the adhesion is not really 100% stable as part of mine is peeling up
1,Product is super flimsy and almost impossible to install
1,it caused a gap that was noticable when closed so i tried taking it off and fixing it so there was no gap and it completely ripped complete ripoff dont buy.
1,They did not match case perfectly every time I pulled out an earbud it would lift.  I finally removed and trashed them.
1,The item does not fit the air pod pro... it broke while installing it ... so I couldn’t return itWaste of money
1,This product sucked. I tried installing them and they broke/ripped and wouldn’t stick. I’d rate a 0 star if I could
1,The application process was not as easy as the instructions made it seem. After having it on for a few hours it had begun to fall off.
1,....This product ripped apart and cam off fast. Currently the pieces are in trash heaven right now. Money wasted with nothing to show for it.
5,It was very easy to install and works perfectly.
1,muy deficiente la forma de instalarlo las pegatinas venían ya sin tener adherencias y completamente frágil.
1,Not a fan completely fell apart while installing
1,These are very thin stickers that peel off and break after one use . Not great dustguards at all would not recommend
5,Follow instructions for putting it on. It looks great!
1,the product does not allow the headphone charger to close properly👎👎👎
1,This is the worst product I have ever bought on Amazon.  Just opening the package and it was broken in more than one place
5,Not only looks but also easy to clean!
1,This was the worst thing. Mine came a broken and crushed and I can’t even ship it back or get my money back. Highly dont recommend
5,Great product but hard to install.
1,Broke I 1 day. Not durable fit was ok overpriced for quality.
1,Terrible product. Mine ripped apart while I was putting it on. It's very fragile. Good idea but terrible execution.
5,Really good to keep headphones safe
5,Great
1,I found them difficult to install.  The bottom one broke when I was installing it.  I never got to use it....
1,Don’t waste your money followed the instructions for install but product doesn’t stick and stops lid from closing
1,Not worth buying
5,Very nice and easy process
1,Just finished installing once I closed it up and opened it little strip came off. Not worth the 10
1,Very Flimsy and directions are hard to understand. That being said installing this is close to impossible.
1,I will never purchase this product again. It’s flimsy ripped during installation and scratched my case and earbud. Installing it also cut my finger up.
1,The value for this isn’t right. It’s a sticker and it breaks easily. It’s totally not worth it. Never buy this
1,Did not adhere properly hard to install properly and when it comes apart creates sharp pieces that cut your fingers. Absolutely horrible product.
1,Difficult to place on and then don’t even stick very well. When you go to remove an air pod it will lift the cover.
1,The instructions to put on the product was very non helpful it honestly didn’t even work when I tried to apply it. Just not a good buy
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Looks amazing!
5,Was difficult to install overall very pleased
1,Thought they would be a solid investment but the film role my second time opening the case
1,Do not buy! I'm typing with 2 fingers as my index finger is badly sliced and I'm holding compresses to it. Very Dangerous should take off the market!
1,The application process was confusing and overall a horrible experience. The product itself ripped on me twice just trying to get it on the AirPods.
1,The product with reason broke after tree das of use.
5,🤙🏽🤙🏽🤙🏽
1,Didn’t last very long and came off in a few days. Didn’t even looked like the color I ordered
1,Just a foil sticker. Nearly impossible to install. For 8 bucks there should have been 10 pack. Waste
1,Needs to be more durable
1,The durability is horrible. It started flaming apart as soon as I brought it out of the packages. DO - NOT - BUY
5,Amazing!!!!!!
1,Horrible product! Super hard to install and doesn’t stick correctly and easily rips. Ripped as soon as I tried to install. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY
1,Not easy to put on and it does not stick well to the case
1,Bought two in one week hard time sticking and because of that was cut twice because its sharp metal. Good idea needs work.
1,Did not like it even after I got a replacement it just didn’t last even a week
1,This product really has no purpose and is very difficult to instal without breaking it.
1,These instructions were not clear I should have seen the video first but by the time that I did it was too late.
1,They ripped and fell apart before I could even use this garbage. Not worth any sort of money.
1,Worst purchase.  The dust guard doesn’t stay on piece of it are constantly peeling off and braking.  Waste of money!
1,Do not waste your money 💰
1,Ripped! This product ripped the first day used:(
5,Over all happy with the product
1,Don’t waste your time with these. Total waste of money as they break off and become useless after 4 days of normal use.
5,Good
1,Awful not happy at all waste of money
1,Honestly a waste mine started coming off about 2-3 days after I applied it. Not worth it.
1,it broke as i was going to apply it... I threw the second part away without even trying to open it... garbage 🗑
1,The box it came in was crushed and so hard to apply I got frustrated and tossed it in the trash. Waste of $
1,Broke within the first day. Not worth it
1,Started to peal after a week of me putting it on.
1,My product after applying broke in 2 days and the adhesive wasn’t sticky enough
5,Great product
1,The idea is good but issues with quality. They covers broke the next day under normal use.
1,It was difficult to install & it broke on me.
1,Became nuisance very quickly and ripped it off. Big waste of money.
1,Peeled off after two weeks. Still had dirt under even with it on. Not worth it.
1,I am not a fan. They didn't stick well and are flaking apart more and more every day.
1,Peeling off case easily with in a week at the most. Poor quality too. Not worth it!
5,Super buenomuchas gracias.
1,Cleaned area very well and adhesive would not stick. Also install is very difficult! Would not recommend this product
5,A little hard to install
1,Don’t buy it’s pointless to have... it rip soon as I put it on.
1,The very first day  the dust guard ripped. The instructions are horrible . Piece by piece it is slowly coming off
1,i had no problem installing. but it’s not durable. the thin cut part easily torn apart after a week of use. waste of money.
1,Not worth it I tried to install just as the video shows and it ripped immediately! Waited for this for about a week wouldn’t recommend at all!
1,Very cheap product for the price that you pay ! Will be speaking with seller customer service about possibly replacing it .
1,Broke when I was installing it ripped like paper as soon as I tried to pull it off
1,one wouldnt stick from the day i recived it and both broke with in a couple weeks
1,They wouldn’t stick to the case and wouldn’t stay in place ripped 2 days into having them
1,Broke while I was placing them waste of money stuff gets under it anyway
5,Makes your airpods look nice
1,After applying the thinner parts broke apart. Wished it came with more than one pair in case. These are so delicate.
1,Not happy at all - it tore after one day
1,Fitment was terrible and left a huge gap on my airpods was only able to do the top one
1,Not recommended at all. Not even a few hours after I installed the “protector” and when I opened the AirPods case it was damaged already.
1,This item got dirt in less than a week and I had the hardest time removing them from the $300 EarPods.
1,Very difficult to separate from paper and even more difficult to put on air pods pro
1,Tore off the moment I took the AirPods out. Colossal waste of time and money. I wish I could get a refund.

1,Suck
4,First of all they look pretty good. But a problem I had was with installation. They come attached to an adhesive plastic. You then have to use this adhesive plastic to pull the dust Garda off. The problem I had was actually getting the dust Garda off the plastic. I ended up using clear scotch tape because the adhesive plastic they gave do not work. They were also on the wrong side so I had to use another piece of adhesive tape to pull it off the first piece of tape. The actual application onto the AirPods isn’t that bad it’s pretty easy. I’ve had them for about 2 weeks and there holding up pretty well. They do get a lot of noticeable smudges though. Overall there pretty good
2,I received these as a gift. They are great at preventing dust from getting in but difficult to install easy to tear & don’t last long. Great idea but needs major improvements. I have a great idea on how to improve this product & I wish there was a way to team up with them to improve what they have started so far. Bummer...
1,I DO NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL.Scratched up my AirPods that I just got for Christmas. The edge of the dust guard is really sharp & abrasive to the point where it’s like sand paper to the polished finish of your AirPods. I’m really strict when it comes to new gadgets by making sure that I do everything possible in order to prevent from scratching and so on. I thought it was a genius idea at first.  Found out the hard way that it’s not worth it. I’m really upset that my brand new headphones are already scratched up pretty good. No matter how carefully you try to apply the dust protector on to headphones you will always have an edge that will be exposed and scratch them up.
1,This dust guard adhered to the case properly but other than that it was trash.The guard did not allow the case to close flush which was aesthetically unappealing. There was a slight lip that caught the edge of my AirPods and after about 8 or 9 cycles of removing them the guard came off… in pieces.I should’ve headed the other reviews but I didn’t even think to read them at all. Would’ve saved me $10 and a few weeks of waiting.Do yourself a favor and pass on these… things. You’ll be happy you did.
1,Look cool good luck trying to put them on. I order the other brand that has a WAAAAY easier method on putting them on.
1,Ripped instantly. The downfall is that it’s magnetic and tries to stick to the AirPods. It also tries to stick to the sticker surrounding the AirPods and that causes it to rip and make a weird noise.
1,Horrible product and a waste of money. Instructions to put on is not easy to read nor follow. Took 15 to attempt to put on device only to end up scratching and damaging my Airpods Pro. No number to contact customer service and not worth anyones time and money.
1,I was very dissatisfied with this product..I guess I expected it to work better but I was very wrong..I got a refund.
1,Do not buy waste of hard earned money even if it is 8$ piece of trash
1,Poor adhesion It did not stay put even with good surface prep cleaning. They are a bit small on the sides and even the spare set x3 pulled up and tore .... very disapointed
1,Save your money! Less than paperthintore into pieces while removing it from the film holder. Literally the worst thing I’ve ever bought in my entire life.
1,Completely pointless. I can't believe anyone would actually buy this crap.
1,Broke the second day I had them
5,Recomendado
3,It really is quite difficult to get these placed correctly. I work in the wireless industry and have applied hundreds of screen protectors over the years so I'm no stranger to the basics of applying various sized protectors for a variety of products. I was not able to apply this though without the product tearing on it's thinnest sections. I used a similar product on my previous pair of original Airpods and didn't have nearly as much trouble as I did with this. The edges of this are also quite sharp. If it's not perfectly aligned on your Airpods case you'll likely scrape your finger across the sharp edges each time you remove one of your earbuds from the case.
1,I absolutely love Elago's products. I've been a fan of them since 2010 and I never thought that they would be capable of making a bad product. But they did. In fact they made a truly abysmal product with this "shield"All of the negative reviews are spot on. Installation is a true nightmare. The "application tool" loses its grip on the shield when it gets close to the case. The magnet from the case is too strong and it pulls it off of the sticker. Once you think you finally have found a way to defeat the magnetic pull of the case you then have to try to line things up.Good. Luck. With. That.Right when you think it's lined up you move a tiny bit and it's all out of place again. Then the alignment sticker somehow loses its adhesion and the shield just refuses to stick. So then you try to put it on with your fingers alone- which actually went better than with that stupid sticker- but then the glue on the shield won't stick and it's off alignment again. So you finally get the thing aligned you press REALLY hard on the shield............ and the shield snaps.I can flawlessly tint car windows. I can apply vinyl like a pro. I'm no stranger to lining up sticky things and making it work. But this is just a miserable excuse. Save your money and don't buy this. Until Elago can come up with a better applicator and fix the problem with the adhesive they use on the shield this is more than likely going to end in disaster for you.Elago- You're so much better than this. You should really hear what your customers are telling you when they say that they're extremely unhappy with this product. 660+  ONE STAR (!!!) reviews out of 2130+ reviews can't all be wrong. Own up to the misery that is this product fix it and try again.Now if you'll excuse me I'm going to try and warranty this thing.
1,I purchased this despite reading the reviews saying not to because ive had airpods before and because of the magnet on the headphones the inside was all scratched up so I decided to buy this for my new airpods pro and what a mistake i made not only this thing is not cheap for what you get but installing it is a pain on your behind then once installed 2 days later a metal piece fell off me not noticing almost cut my finger because the piece is super sharp also leaving another sharp piece sticking out as seen on the picture also the airpod case does no fully closes once this is installed as they advertise it and then to make things even better they have absolutely no customer service so youre left with a broken sharp piece of metal that the company that makes it wont support their lack of quality. Cool concept but a bad product and even worst company
3,Like most of the reviews there are mixed results when comparing the ease of installation since there’s very little room for error. I am on my 2nd pair of dust guards and can finally say that I got them on perfectly but that was after going through my 1st pair which I thought I did a decent job at installing.If it is not properly aligned your AirPods can frequently graze against the dust guard that’s sticking out and cause it to lift from the case. This happened to my first pair and for a solid 3 months or so I had a small area of the AirPods case uncovered. Annoying but I lived with it.I just decided to buy a 2nd pair so I can get the fit perfectly and was happy to have a better go around this time. It works amazingly as described when installed correctly and have not had any troubles with it so far.
2,I bought one of these for me and my gf installed without an issue ✔️ that is when the first picture is. A day later the second picture happens...I opened the case pulled ear bud out and pop goes a piece of the guard. It was pretty cool until that point. Might just be a defective piece bc my gf hasn’t had the same problem. Guess you’ll be rolling the dice could get anywhere from a 1 to a 5 star experience. Durability is a 1 star. Another day down another piece falls
5,I got these because my last Airpods case got some weird and unremovable stains in these areas and I wanted to avoid that with the new ones. They fit perfectly and look nice although they could maybe make some clear or white ones for people who prefer it to stay white like the original case. The installation was pretty straightforward but I did not know there was a video until after I installed it and that would've made it way easier. They should add in the packaging the QR code or link for the video right where the instructions are. So far they seem fine will update if necessary.
5,The first release of AirPods Pro had a defect where the closing hinge was loose and made it quite annoying and buddy about ruined the product if you have this defect this product will actually fix that. After putting mine on the hinge no longer slides around. It’s great besides that too but I’m very happy about the hinge. Thank you elago!
1,I like the concept of this product BUT the material tends to tear VERY easily. When you try to actually apply the item onto the airpods case it starts magnetizing and pulling making it very difficult to align even with the guide. this is the second one they sent after I submitted a return for the first due to what I perceived as damage. I wanted to like this but stay away. I will try to return this one as well. I must say the seller was extremely quick at sending me a replacement after the first return.
5,On my rating on durability I rated 3 because I just got them. They are a bit tricky to install. What ever you do don’t use your finger to see if fits well in the edges. It is metal I got cut by sliding my finger inside the EarPod hole to see if it fit well it hurt!. Overall it’s doing what it says it should do They’ve been staying clean. And above all they look cute!
2,At first I loved these dust seals but after a few months they started to lift and three nights ago it broke and started to lift on the lid. I put this seal on my pros right out of the box brand new after wiping them with alcohol wipes. They do not last long at all and they need to send me a new one because I wasted my money!!
4,Great dust guard but it’s a pain in the butt to apply because the magnetic case keeps making the dust guard flap down and stick when you’re trying to get it perfect. Also if you’re OCD this is gonna be a good little challenging to put on and get perfect. Overall it’s great makes the Airpod look super premium but it takes time to get it right.
2,After about a month they’re ruined or peeling.  Applying them was not easy. Did it save them from getting dirty? Sure.  But I’ll have to keep replacing them every few weeks.  Not worth it for me.
1,I tried following the directions provided with the kit to apply the product to the AirPods Pro case but man was it hard.To begin with it wasn't clear exactly how to apply the guide sticker to the actual magnetic stickers. Then if you don't get it right on the very edge of the guide you can't line it up properly.To top it off if you don't get it applied exactly right on the first go it will adhere to the case and you can't really pull it off again to try to line it up.Mine actually ripped and it's now just a useless sticker...
1,So I was excited to get these in the mail and I have to say they looked pretty good and legit.But when I tried to install the the ripped on me. Even though they are metal the rip so easily.  And it happened to both even if I tried very carefully.  Do not buy this item.  Not worth the money or the hassle.
1,It was very pretty but super hard to install.  Very flimsy and has already broke.  Only had them for two days.  Not worth it at all.
3,Looks cute when you first put it on but the color faded in about a week. Not very easy to put on but doesn’t stay on very good. The color is different from the picture. Not worth the money in my opinion
5,love it ! 💕 match’s my macbook case and charger !
1,It does not work well difficult to install the material breaks when installed it is not of good quality and after several days it began to take off on its own. I only used for few days.
1,I was disappointed with my purchase.  I tried to follow the instructions to complete the installation and unfortunately the sticker adhesion continued to peel off.
5,I bought this for my husband and he loved it
4,Not that bad and the reviews are really weird it’s easy to install as long as you don’t mess up which side is sticky and which isn’t. It also just looks very nice
1,There is a bigger gap in between as you can see on pictures.  So how is it gonna keep the dust out of my airpods pro?
4,It was somewhat hard to place it but I made it they look great on it and looks like it works for dust and metal.Also they close correctly without problems.
1,Was a waste of time did not last seconds now the top has pealed off
4,It looks cool but I don’t know about the whole “dust guard” part. If you having trouble putting on the bottom sticker just get a toothpick and push it through.
1,Might as well of taken my 9 dollars and flushed it down the toilet. This thing is about as durable as paper. It tore on the top and bottom stickers within 2 days. Absolute trash product. Do not buy it.
3,My AirPod case is slightly open and it kind of distracts
4,I like the product don’t get me wrong it’s great value for dust protection. The only issue I had was one part of the adhesive fell off leaving a little pet vulnerable but if that issue doesn’t appear for you it’s a great choice.
1,do not buy
1,I had them on for 2 days and it ripped. I can only imagine they will rip off easily now. They went on good no rip and I thought great no problem so how did it rip from nothing happening? Not worth the money
5,As described look good and keep a very nice appearance.
1,I did it as the video is shown the bottom one stocked on good the top one where is so think it broke and it wouldn’t stick for nothing I would by this product or recommend to anyone 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻...
4,I like the 18k shine but I didn’t like how it scratched the AirPod itself.
5,Gives your airpods that added protection and gives a nice sleek look. The application is a little tough but be patient. It's also very sharp so be careful when putting it on
5,Easy install not hard at all seems to be on there really so far
1,This is the worst thing I could have spend $8 on. Do not buy this product. You will end up throwing it away in frustration. The instructions make no sense whatsoever. I very seriously think this is the worst thing I’ve ever bought in my entire life. Shipped fast.
2,Difícil de install
3,Pieces didn’t wanna stick to guide sticker and snaps easily. Its on my phone now but on it broken.
5,Easy to Insatll
5,Some spots didn’t stick so they chipped off just minor little spots. Otherwise great dust guards
3,It ripped after a month
5,A little difficult to install for me as a first time user but there are videos and customer support and can help you through the process
5,It doesn’t not lose the adhesive once stuck on your device properly very clean and quick application.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Not that easy to install and very fragile would buy it
3,Honestly it’s a great product. I really enjoyed it until after a week...  The dust guard started peeling off. I assumed that I installed it wrong so I ordered another one. Same thing after a week. Started peeling.
1,Don’t buy it. It breaks off after 2 days! I do not recommend it. It doesn’t allow the AirPods to charge because of the gap it leaves
2,Super hard to put on and ended up ripping in less then a week. Great idea but not long lasting.
5,Love them
1,Enough said. It looks great for the 5 days it stayed on. I cleaned the case and applied exactly as they said. Don't waste your money.
1,No funcionan  no dura el adhesivo y muy mala calidad  NO LO COMPREN NO LO RECOMIENDO
1,Terrible it was a pain in the buttto get it on and it kept pee;ing after like 20 min on
1,Actual ass had to return these cause it was very difficult to put on then tears the next day. Also a pain to remove these.
1,Hard installation unclear instructions and its a waste of money!
2,LITERALLY BROKE AFTER A WEEK LIKE UMMMMMM. but it does stick good BUT it’s a bit difficult. over all not the best thing i’ve bought
1,The adhesive wasn’t good the product is too thin and I wish it covered more of the surface
5,Great product i recommend if you want to make yojr AirPods keep looking new
1,About 3 days after applying 3 different peices came off. I do not recommend does not last. It’s also difficult to get the alignment just right when applying.
1,Peels and doesn’t work. Hard to put on and the chips and flakes and gets everywhere .
1,Terrible. Didn’t even go on AirPods correctly and totally not sticky enough
5,I like how it fits and looks but start peeling off one week after installation and I clean the AirPod case before installation
2,Product should be $2.00. It is gimmicky
1,Literally ripped in half off of nothing never even got to out it on the aurpods
1,In 2 weeks the sticker fell apart. I went to to take out the AirPod and a the fallen part of the sticker cut my finger.
5,All the dust protesters I’ve used they always rip over time which is very annoying but this one has really held up perfectly and was easy to apply
1,Don’t ever waste your time.  Not worth it
1,This was a complete waste of time and money don’t buy this
5,I love it it keeps my AirPods looking clean. I work at a tire shop so dust is everywhere
4,Very good product must be very careful putting it on
1,Impossible to line up correctly
1,hard to apply rips easily
5,Very good quality
4,Was a little hard to Install but they help a lot
5,this product was great and delivered very quick
5,Very simple to install
1,Very bad product
1,The stickers didn’t line up with the holes. They were very close but overhung just enough that the earbud would catch on it when taking them out of the case. After 3 days of use they no longer stuck to the case. I had to throw them away. Dont waste your money on these.
1,Almost immediately comes off/breaks
4,Hard to put it on
5,This is my Second purchase after my upgrading To the pro version.
5,Item was good
5,Like the product
5,As long as you have some patience then it goes on good contrary to other reviews. Will update after a week or two.
5,I got the new airpod pros and judging how my last AirPods looked I wanted to get a dust guard. As soon as I took my new airpod out of the box I put the dust guard right on. Looks really nice and the case still close’s smoothly.
2,Pro: looks very sophisticated  Makes your AirPods look even more expensiveCon: not sticky enough in regards to sticking to the AirPods  Too sticky with itself so that when you open it it comes off  Easy to tear apart when applying
5,Just be careful with it you can cut your self
1,It rips so easily and is really sharp if it does. The first one I bought came with a small tear in it which then turned into shreds of it all over my counter top. I then got a replacement and the same thing happened. The top guard was fine but the bottom piece just doesn't want to work at all. Very disappointing because if it was to have worked it would of looked perfect.
4,Extremely difficult to apply but patience and if you gay get your fingers out of the way makes it worth it. The stick guard doesn’t work AT ALL. but you can apply manually. Worth $10 or less dollars don’t pay more
5,They work great
5,I really just got the because they would look cute with the case. But they actually do protect in a way the build up of earwax on the inside. I know this because I looked at my boyfriends and his are really nasty idk way he doesn’t clean them but good buy
3,Ripped both when putting them on. I think now that I’ve done it I could do the next time with ease but doing it the first time is very hard. Adhesion isn’t great but I think would be fine if you got it on straight and with no wrinkles.Overview: now that I’ve done it once I think I could easily do it again and make it look better. But it is hard to do
5,Keeps your AirPods case with less lint a bit hard to apply so take your time.
5,Great product and good price
5,The magnetic adhesive works well. Its not hard to apply seeing they give a guide on how to. Best dust guard  I have purchased on Amazon and I bought many. This product really keeps the dust out the AirPods and keeps it clean.
5,Great product
1,I absolutely hated it. The sticker kept peeling off the dust cord doesn’t even work with the guide sticker.
5,It looks amazing but wish I came with some stinger stickers
5,Muy practico
5,I love how this looks on my airpods and keeps them clean! The process of putting them on was tricky but I got it and love the look.
5,These are a pretty awesome little invention and a very cheap accessories that has big ROI.  It takes a little bit of patience and a steady hand to install them but they look wonderful! I was very pleasantly surprised by the almost mirror dark aluminum color. Fits the apple airpod pro vibe. Also before this I was constantly using my only to swipe dust out of the charging case and I don’t do that anymore. Extremely effective.  And they are ridiculously cheap. Who cares if they tear in a couple months. Buy more! I’m going to buy a few just to have on hand. Seriosuly if you want to protect your AirPods as much as possible this is a very important part of that.
5,Definitely come in handy for neat freak! These little things are very durable the adhesion is great and it is a awesome value for the money. You wouldn’t believe how a small thing makes such a big difference
1,Followed instructions carefully and still managed to break it with minimal force. Not satisfied. If it came with 2 sets that would be nice like screen protectors give you a second chance. Very finicky.
1,It broke as soon as I got it would not recommend getting
1,The product they received was not sticky enough to stay on my AirPods the only thing holding them down all the magnets in the actual case itself. Very disappointing now every time I open and close my case there’s a little clinking noise.
1,They ripped immediately upon installation they are extremely thin and the instruction in the box are very vague. Will be sending these back not worth the $$$
5,I liked it a lot at first but after using my AirPods daily for a week or 2 some of the edges started coming up and now 2 parts are broken off. So for heavy users probably not the best.
5,Great customer service and product
1,I have a lot to complain about. Installing these is very very difficult even with lots of patience. When the case is closed there is absolutely a gap. And when you open the case occasionally the back edge of the bottom cover will peel up. And I’m constantly afraid that I’ll get stabbed by metal that might flake off (other buyers review read before buying.) They look nice so for now I’ll keep them around but if I could go back I would have just got a normal sticker.(Edit-) Day Two removed them. Began to peel up everytime I’d open my AirPods case and a flake of metal stuck to my ear tips like a different reviewer on here. Going to buy stickers. Don’t buy these trying to help you.
1,After installing I had my finger slide across it and cut my finger and bleed. Don’t buy even if they look cool.
4,They’re hard to understand thee instructions so u just put them on the best you can w out touching the sticky part. The ones I bought were Gold I got the silver or white gold looking ones but needed to make sure no dust would get in but like I said the introduction are short and more written in Chinese They are a nice lil touch tho I just Wish the seller Sent THE GOLD as a ordered 🤷🏼‍♀️
3,It literally took me 45 minutes to install them. The glue stick pad didn’t help at all. Had to put them on with my fingers.
5,Easy to install and perfect for keeping any debris from dirtying the case
5,Thay are nice
3,Dificult to apply I end up discarding it.
4,At first I was discouraged by the reviews because of how “difficult” it was to install the dust guards. And to add how it was easy to tear them during installation. But to be honest they were easy to install and as long as your careful they won’t tear during installation.I’ve had them for about a week or so and they’re still on and there is no damage. As far as the lid to the AirPods charging case not closing all the way I use the Catalyst waterproof case so I can’t say anything about that.
1,It lifts easily and removes itself
1,I followed the instructions to the tee. And it still ripped as I was installing them. I have bought like 6 of these thinking it was me.  Horrible product! They don’t even offer to replace it. I will make a YouTube video reviewings this soon.
1,If i could give no stars i would. It broke within 20 minutes of applying. It is a filmsy piece of plastic worth a fraction of a penny that they charge you $8 for. Lol. Garbage product.
5,Gracias
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Es a la medida y ajusta muy bien recomendado
1,I work two jobs that aren’t the cleanest and I bought these hoping it would keep my AirPods clean. Sadly that wasnt the case. This literally lasted me two days before falling apart.Apart from that if always made a scraping noise when I opened them. I put it on pretty darn good if you ask me. Overall the quality wasn’t what I expected either. I thought a pair of two would come in the pack considering it’s price but only a single pair came. I’ve seen other dust guards half the price and worked better. I thought the extra bucks would mean its better. Not in this case. Overall not satisfied so don’t put these as your first choice.
1,Didn’t last long
5,If you watch the video the instalation is quite simple. It looks great and fits well.
5,It’s worth it for keeping out dust and dirty just have to wipe the buds down every other week but other then perfect but trying to apply them in the case is a little tricky just need steady aim and good vision
5,Great no dust at all it’s amazing
1,Poor quality don’t buy it
4,This came in handy more than I thought it would… but its perfect. I only gave it four stars because it was as easy to apply like the instructions state… could have been user error but I refuse to believe that 😂😂
4,These are better than the last ones for sure. These have pretty precise cutouts and even allowed for a do over when I Got it stuck in the wrong spot. One thing with these little bad boys is that the tolerances are razor thin so a RCH off and the edge sticks over the opening and you catch it almost every time until it peels off
5,This product fits perfectly and looks great on my Air Pod pros with the new case I purchased.
5,Excellent dust cover
1,Barely had it for a day and it’s already broken its as thin as paper but as fragile as foil get something else
3,Hard to install
5,honestly very solid. It was kind of tricky at first to attach them but I eventually got the hang of it.😅
1,Mal producto no compren esa basura
5,There were perfect
1,I placed these on my case as perfect as one possibly care with great care and precision.  The next day I noticed it made a scraping sound when removing the buds from the case and looked at my AirPods Pro's and there's a pretty big scrape on them all things considered.  Would not recommend.  It's too sharp and can scratch your buds!
5,Great adherence and easy to install. Doesn’t get caught on ear buds pulling them out. Bought others before but fell off and didn’t fit right. These do
5,Perfect all around. No issues at all. Great adhesive
5,
1,It's not easy putting the dust guard in place on the case and after a day or two it starts to move and pull away from the case
1,Not durable at all. It broke as soon as I opened it.
3,It rips very easily
1,Man this could've been executed  better.
5,Exactly what I needed to keep my airpod pros looking clean and new. Waiting for the day that I can find a white dust guard tho so that it isn’t as noticeable.
5,I’m not really a fan Adhesion isn’t the greatest flimsy material
5,Excellent product!
5,Looks good
5,Very happy with the set of dust guards for my son's Air Pod Pro's.  Seller was quick to ship easy to work with and communicated well.  Would work with again in an instant - recommended to others as well!
3,Es bueno para cumplir su función de impedir que la suciedad que quede en la superficie abierta de los AirPod pro.Doy 3 estrellas por 3 razones en particular.-La calidad del color es mala. Al usarlo en el día a día parece que los protectores son calcomanías doradas pero de un color tipo envoltura de regalo dorado. Pensé que tendría una calidad de color metálica parecido al marco de acero de algún celular.- Al estar ya instalados los protectores no permiten el cierre total de los AirPods. Algo que a mi parecer no se ve bien.-Por las 2 razones previas creo que el precio es excesivo para su calidad.
4,Tuve la primer generación de Airpods para lo cuál hubiera sido perfecto este producto ya que al abrir y cerrar los audífonos se rayaron y se devaluaron para el mercado de segunda mano.Compre este producto para mis Airpods Pro no busque ningún video y batalle bastante para su colocación incluso rompí un pequeño tramo hay videos sencillos y muy bien explicados para su colocación de haber sabido...Con todo y las complicaciones lo recomiendo ampliamente.
2,This is great for collecting the dust on your AirPods however it’s not sturdy enough not enough durability and with the sharp edges you really have to be careful because it’s very sharp. It’s very finicky!! Also when you put it on your case doesn’t close together very well. It leaves a slight gap between the cover and the base. It all those slight misses were adjusted this would be a really great product for your AirPods.
5,Se adhiere bien solo que es complicado de poner.
1,-it's just bad quality and hard to apply-literally took me a solid 25 minutes putting the bottom part of the the dust guard bc it wouldn't line up properly due to the magnets of the AirPods-I gave up putting the top part because the adhesive wouldn't stick and it rips so easily-literally $15 down the drain but oh whale-gives you little cuts too so beware-the YouTube tutorial isn't even helpful either
1,El producto se ve muy bonito recién puesto pero no pasó ni un mes y se me empezó a romper! Es muy delicado y aún puesto es muy probable que se te vaya a romper. Jamás se va a ver limpio al menos el color oro rosa es un imán de manchas. La instalación fue muy difícil aún siguiendo el tutorial de Youtube.
1,It is a nice product however I followed the video on using the sticker guide to place the dust guards on my air pod pro and they did not transfer onto the guide. Eventually trying to get these things to transfer the top guard tore. Guards are supposed to peel off with glue side down when I place the guide over it but it wouldn’t come off at all. Waiting to hear back from Elago for a replacement before I ask Amazon for a refund.
1,This product is not very good. I attempted to install it following all the directions and it tore immediately. It also stuck to the applicator better then the case itself. So when I went to peel the applicator off the sticker came right off the case.
2,Es casi imposible colocarlo. Las instrucciones no son nada claras es muy delgado y se rompe al colocarlo. Se despega y se rompe. Muy caro para lo que es.
2,Installation is over complicated. I had to look up their YouTube vid just to get started. Watch out installing the top side the metal dust guard gets attracted to the magnets in the AirPods makes it really tricky to align.Also doesn’t close comfortably when you have both layers so got rid of the top layer all together
3,Quite difficult to install and the installation instruction (placement guide) is confusing - advise to simply ignore the so-called instruction and apply the guard as stickers using your intuition.Once installed the guard is decent and functions as described and intended.
1,Nothing I like about this product. Its an absolute wast of money. A piece just came off and so difficult to put it on unlike they marketed it. Its 1year warrant so requested a seller and haven’t even responded. Very poor quality and customer service!
5,Muy buena protección siento que sella muy bien los bordes del estuche para impedir que se ensucien con el tiempo de uso ajusta perfectamente dentro de las orillas.
1,No lo compren! Es de pésima calidad y se rompe súper fácil
2,i don’t like it it makes the lid sticky and makes a sound when opened. overall not the best product i wish i never spent my money on it.
3,I ha to buy 2 kit to get one ok instal. Cause the first one was not straight.
2,Hard to put on. Once you mess up that’s it you wasted money. A bit too pricey for what it is.
4,I had no problem putting the bottom one on but the top one was a struggle. Did go on the first time and had to redo it then it didn’t look good I so ended up taking it off. Focus really hard to insure it goes on correctly.
1,The guards broke multiple time trying to apply. I tried to piece it together like a puzzle but was pointless. I returned them and fortunately got a refund. I may try and buy a similar product but different brand that isn't so fragile.
1,Tried to put it on and broke right away so had to put on just wasted $13
5,Tiene una ligera complicación para instalarlo si no se es muy hábil le va a costar trabajo ponerla bien
5,Very thin so the case can close properly so be very gentle and Precise when putting them on. Otherwise it’s great
1,Mal producto llevo 4 dias con el y ya se desprendieron pedazos materiales de mala calidad rayo uno de los audífonos
3,No es un producto de excelente calidad se me empezó a romper al mes de uso. No lo volvería a comprar.
1,This is the second time we have purchased these with the same end result; they have been removed.  If you don’t get them on perfectly they scratch your AirPods.  Very disappointed.
3,Pues la verdad en mi opinion no es super util
5,You need to use scissors to separate the two sides and then the application will be easy. But the item is very good.
4,A little hard to actually put in place...but works really well...
1,dejando de lado lo dificil que es instalarlo es algo completamente inutil
4,The only problem I had was that it is so thin and flimsy that it ripped almost immediately after application. However Elago went above and beyond to contact me and refund the money when I hadn’t even asked for it. Greatly appreciated
1,El título no define lo que se vende
3,Cumple con la función pero es muy difícil de poner y se rompe fácilmente el precio es algo elevado
4,Overall it keeps the dust out well but I found installing it to be a little challenging as it’s very fragile
1,tres mauvais
5,Súper fácil de instalar le da un look diferente y protege a los AirPods
2,They were super hard to get on. The top one ripped apart so I had to throw it out and only got the bottom one on.
5,Good
1,It broken in 5 days
1,Se rompe muy facilmente se despega.
5,Like it
5,Mejor que otras marcas lo recomiendo.
1,The product is not that good as shown.  It doesn’t fit on airpods and gum is not strong to make a hold on airpods.
5,Buen producto pero muy frágil
3,Se rompe muy facil muy delicado y el precio es muy elevado para sólo contener 1
2,I was not able to install the dust guards without tearing them. The sharp metal part cut me.
1,Pas facile à installer ça s’est brisé à l’installation
2,Once you messed up there will be no turning back. Hella expensive
1,dust still gets in and the sticker is already peeling off
1,Applying guide not accurate wasted my money
1,Hard/Annoying to install. Ripped as soon as I tried to adjust it.
5,Perfect what i prefer。
1,No sirve de nada al día siguiente de haberlo puesto se daño
1,It got broken
2,It started breaking apart a couple days after being installed
1,They are so fragile and not worth it
4,Good product
5,Great
2,El producto raspó mis airpodsSe empezó a descarapelar y cada que sacaba el AirPod derecho pasaba justo  por donde se descarapeló no me había dado cuenta pero hoy me pareció ver raspado el plástico de los airpodsNo recomiendo este producto para nadaNo creo que sirva de mucho y el riesgo de que se rompa o lastime tus airpods es muy alto
4,Messed up installing it and it tore a little bit. It’s fits perfectly though!
2,Quedan como unas pequeñas rebabas que pueden llegar a rayar los airpods a la hora de sacar un audífono se rompió un sticker la calidad es media pero no es lo que uno esperaría por el precio tan alto además se ensucian con solo verlos y se quedan pegadas las marcas de los dedos.
1,First off the sticker that came with this to use as a guide did not even stick to the dust guard. I was left finding something that would. You got to pack your patience. A good ol' half inch of it had to be cut off. Bad product. Not happy at all.
1,This item is getting a 1/5 based off of my experience. Firstly the durability is highly questionable even though they had said in the description of the product “long lasting”. It is incredibly difficult to apply and they only provide one set of this expensive cheap cover so if you mess it up you’re finished for. Obviously unless you want to get it replaced which is just adding to the cons of this product (I did ask for a replacement so let’s see how that goes). I suggest you wait a while and get your protective dust guards off of Ali Express for much cheaper ($1.80/CAD). I will update this review on customer service as soon as I get a response from Elago Canada.
1,Don’t bother trying it out just read the reviews.Ripped on me using the guide plus too pricy for a piece of paper-like metal. Sell this for $1 and I’ll keep it as it is.
2,Was not easy to install at all. The pieces were backwards on the plastic sheet as compared to the instructions which made it difficult to install. I had to remove the stickers from the sheets to spin them the correct way. The cutouts for the earbud holes were smaller then then the holes in the case and the material is razor sharp I have cut myself when cleaning debris from the holes.
4,Perfect fit. Look great.The installation instructions are very poorly done.We did not fallow them.It needs a better template for installation  Thank goodness my girlfriend figured it out.
1,This product is easy to install and it looks good. However the sharp edges will scratch and damage your AirPods as you insert and roll them out of the cases. I ripped these off shortly after putting them on to prevent any further damage. Waste of $15. Do not buy.
5,It's amazing product.
2,Not easy installation
1,Not easy to install it brakes in the 2 day…Not a good product….It looks that the trend for products that you buy from amazon now… Yeah!!!!!!
1,Disappointed in the quality of the pieces and +++ difficulty to put the dust guard on case. Wasn’t able to get it on and the dust guard ripped after continues tries to put on case. Disappointed with my purchase
5,pour proteger mon appareil
1,Not worth buying it’s just a waste of money..
1,Came off after a few weeks
5,A bit pricey but its a very good product for your airpods. People don’t know how to put it thats why they break the item so fast. Try to watch YouTube before putting it it’ll save you time and prevent it from breaking!
5,Very nice
1,It’s ripped and teared on the 3rd day of used. Not gonna recommend this one
1,Extremely annoying to get on and Brooke easily...
1,Case was not closing properly after applying and it got broken but i tried to apply as instructed
3,Edit février 2020 : En voulant nettoyer via un mouchoir simple les résidus sur la protection un bout de celui c'est arraché net sans avoir forcé. Produit difficile à entrenir dans le temps car fragile. 10euros pour un produit qui va finalement accumuler de la saleté avec impossibilité de lui faire peau neuve c'est très moyen.Attention : il faut un peu de patience de la rigueur de quoi nettoyer la surface du boitier et de la bonne lumière pour pouvoir installer proprement les stickers sans que ceux si ne se déforment ou rayent les airpods par une mauvaise application.Le résultat est bon et donne un aspect chromé agréable. La fermeture n'est pas gêné par l'épaisseur des stickers qui sont vraiment fin tout en sachant que le boitier des airpods pro laisse de base ce mini liseré au capot qui ne donne pas un aspect tout lisse quand il est fermé
3,Ho già avuto la prima versione di AirPods ed effettivamente il prodotto si sporca parecchio perché le calamite attirano materiale che poi una volta schiacciato dalla chiusura è difficile da pulire.L'idea del Dust Guard è eccezionale e le mascherine metalliche sono di una precisione dimensionale micrometrica.Purtroppo non è fornito nessun sistema di ausilio per l'applicazione. Solo una guida assolutamente insufficiente.Le mascherine sono fornite su un trasparente rigido che non è sagomato per agevolare l'applicazione.Il risultato è che per applicarle serve un gioco di prestigio (le mascherine sono sensibili ai magneti della chiusura)Per chi le compra io consiglio di operare in questo modo (cosa che non ho fatto e mi sono letteralmente impiccato):1) senza separare i due trasparenti con al loro interno le mascherine sagomare "con molta attenzione" le mascherine in modo da poterle applicare senza toglierle dal supporto trasparente superiore.2) Separare i due supporti trasparenti3) Applicare le mascherine tenendo ben presente che sono sottilissime e si staccano con difficolta dal trasparente.Insomma avrei dato 5 stelle se l'applicazione fosse stata un minimo più agevole.E' stato letterelamente un gioco di prestigio !!!!In bocca al lupo
3,Tutto bene e molto bello fino a quando 3 settimane dopo averli attaccati si iniziano a staccare e a raccogliere molto sudiciodo due stelle perche esteticamente molto molto carina ma niente di più
3,Just like screen protectors this expensive dust guard is very tricky to align. Once it’s even slightly in position it’s almost impossible to realign without creasing or bending the guard.It’s very flimsy yet sharp around all edge and is a fingerprint magnet.Even though it provides an individual look and you can coordinate it with say your iPhone I just wouldn’t bother.Has mine for a few days and it’s already lifting.
4,From the reviews of other users I was put off from buying this product since there were many complaints about the installation being hard and that the product would sometimes tear when applying it to the case.However I decided to try for myself and the installation was no problem at all. The guide sticker they supply in the box was great and you can take all the time you want to apply it properly. You can tell that the sticker is fragile but handling it with care there should be no reason why it would tear.I love the aesthetic and it seems like it will definitely keep the dust out.
3,La pose est très minutieuse ; J'ai obtenu un beau résultat mais c'est très fragile
3,Der elago Dust Guard tut was es verspricht. Leider ist das auftragen Millimeter Arbeit wodurch das nichts für Leute mit zittrigen Händen ist.Das ist bereits das zweite mal das ich sie gekauft habe. Beim ersten Mal konnte ich sie trotz Probleme richtig auftragen. Beim zweiten Mal hatte ich leider nicht so viel Glück und musste eine Seite komplett ab machen und nach ein paar Tagen habe ich das auch mit der anderen Seite gemacht weil eine Seite alleine etwas blöd aussieht.Der Guard selbst hat jedoch eine sehr gute Qualität hält sehr lange und schützt vor Kratzer und Staub.Mein Pro Tipp: kauft die Option wo zwei Paare drin sind (auch wenn sie etwas teuerer sind) damit ihr falls es beim ersten Mal nicht klappt noch einen weiteren Versuch habt :D
2,1. It's incredibly hard to put on so if you find it hard to put on a screen protector don't even bother with this2. It's incredibly fragile although metal the strips are very thin and easily break. I closed the lid and opened it and it broke3. If you don't manage to put them on very well and if the edges protrude the metal will damage your expensive pods. I noticed that the strip was hanging off the edge on one side as I ran my fingers across it to check the fit.Great idea by elago but I think it's better to just clean your pods routinely rather than wasting money on this as it'll most likely not work for you or it'll damage your pods anyways.
5,Scrivo questa recensione in quanto noto molte recensioni negative del tutto ingiustificate dovute probabilmente al fatto che la fase di installazione è stata presa un po’ “sotto gamba” andando poi a rovinare il prodotto finito.Specifico film da subito che sono un normale cliente che ha pagato il prodotto regolarmente senza promessi rimborsi o cose varie.Specifico inoltre che di queste ne ho applicate ben 3 su 3 diverse AirPods tutte con stesso a maggior ragione di quanto sto per dire.Partiamo dal presupposto che sicuramente l’installazione non è la cosa più facile del mondo soprattutto nelle AirPods Pro dove c’è da allineare il bordo sottilissimo al fine di avere tutto ben centrato ruolo fondamentale la pulizia del case da eseguire per bene prima di procedere all’installazione e la pressione dell’adesivo una volta installato altrimenti ovviamente non attaccherà bene.Detto ciò dopo 2 settimane sulle mie AirPods personali e 1 mese sulle altre 2 AirPods di amici non posso che consigliare il prodotto in quanto con le dovute accortezze il prodotto svolge un egregio lavoro nessuna rottura dell’adesivo nessuno scollamento e nulla che consenta di parlare male di questo prodotto.Sicuramente consigliato anche per dare un piccolo tocco personalizzato al case.
2,Die Seiten sind sehr scharf und kantig wirklich nicht gut. Klar es schützt vor staub und so aber es löst sich nach 1-2 Monaten und nochmal kaufen würde ich es nicht.
2,Ich bin schon lange ein eigentlich zufriedener Kunde von Elago Produkten. Die Airpod Hüllen sind wirklich gut und die Dustshields FRÜHER auch.Jetzt mit meinen neuen Airpods pro wollte ich wieder diese dustshields haben jedoch halten diese nach dem zweiten Tag schon nicht mehr! Falls es möglich wäre kostenfrei diese Dustshields nochmal zu bekommen wäre das toll. So war es leider reine Geldverschwendung!Nachdem ich sie drauf gemacht habe bleibt jetzt auch ein recht großer spalt offen der auch staub reinlassen würde wenn man nicht grade eine Hülle drauf hat!Sehr enttäuschend leider
2,Interessante come idea evita l'accumulo di sporcizia sulla parte interna della custodia delle AirPods.Nota dolente di non facile installazione e comunque crea uno spessore che non permette la chiusura perfetta delle AirPods
4,I have only had these installed a week now so can’t say for certain they are effective but so far seems to be reducing dust buildup.  It should be noted they are a bit tricky to install correctly ie get them perfectly aligned as you only have one shot at this so any readjustment is not possible as they will rip ( so thin). aesthetically they look great and it a nice custom look to an otherwise boring interior.
4,Buoni i materiali e la funzionalità: finora nessuna polvere metallica è presente nella custodia. Il dimensionamento della parte superiore che prevede bordi molto sottili non è precisissimo: è fuori tolleranza per qualche decimo di millimetro e questo rende difficoltoso il centraggio sul dispositivo. Una stella in meno perché mancava il kit di pulizia che ho visto in altri commenti e che credo sia fondamentale per una corretta istallazione. Il prezzo penso sia caro ma comunque è da considerare che i materiali devono essere contemporaneamente resistenti e ultra sottili e che devono essere lavorati con minime tolleranze
3,The product is good but they peeled of on the wrong side of the plastic and there is no way of using them now I’m disappointed but they did look good
2,Nicht wie im der Beschreibung zu installieren hat mich leider enttäuscht. Dieser Staubschutz ist leicht magnetisch und muss von der transparenten Folie abgezogen werden und dann mit viel Fingerspitzen Gefühl ausgesetzt werden. Habe dabei bereis Schwierigkeiten gehabt wobei ich kleine Hände habe (weiblich). Leider nicht so wie ich es mir vorgestellt habe jetzt ist es zwar drauf aber hat mich nerven gekostet.
4,Il prodotto è veramente comodo bisogna stare un po’ attenti mentre lo si applica ma seguendo le istruzioni ci si riesce al primo colpo. Dopo 3 settimane però ho notato che si era tipo ossidato non arrugginito ma l’effetto era quello così ho deciso di toglierlo: una cosa difficilissima! Infatti la pellicola è fragilissima e togliendola si strappava in mille pezzi e negli angoli della custodia ho dovuto utilizzare degli spilli rischiando di segnare la custodia. Sotto la pellicola però la custodia è rimasta come nuova anche dopo 3 settimane peccato che dopo poco si rovini...
3,Das war am Anfang gut aber mit der Zeit wird das schmutziger und wird langsam kaputt. Wenn man das nach Monaten von AirPods Case entfernt dann sieht man Fleck den man schwer weg kriegt.
4,It’s good I won’t lie but at the end of the day if u bend it u won’t be able to bend it back into place.So I’d beware of that but truly other then that it’s a great product
4,Devo dire che è molto bello da guardareL’effetto acciaio e lucido è una figata!Molto comodo per personalizzare un po’ la custodiaUnica pecca installazione difficoltosa visto che la forma è tagliata così precisa ... attenzione a come viene incollato o sporgerà di anche pochissimo
4,Der Staubschutz kam pünktlich bei mir an und war schön Verpackt.Mithilfe eines YouTube Videos von Elago war das Produkt dann auch einfach anzubringen. Man braucht aber dennoch ruhige Hände! Mein Staubschutz liegt nicht ganz gerade auf. Die Folie zum aufbringen hätte dabei ruhig etwas stabiler sein können.Der Staubschutz selber glänzt sehr stark und zieht Fingerabdrücke praktisch gerade zu an. Die Farbe Space-Grey ist durch das glänzen schwer zu erkennen was mich aber nicht stark stört.Leider sind die Magneten der AirPods durch die Folie etwas blockiert und halten nicht mehr so stark wie vorher.Dennoch hält der Staubschutz auf beiden Seiten sehr gut und erfüllt auch seinen Zweck. Von außen erkennt man keine schwarze Linie und die AirPods sehen dadurch auch nicht weniger edel aus.Ich würde es trotz der Kritik erneut kaufen.
2,Wenn die Aufkleber aufgebracht sind sehen sie Schick aus! Ja wenn den das ist der Knackpunkt! Erstmal sollte man sich die Aufkleber passend ausschneiden damit sie vernünftig aufgeklebt werden können die Anleitung hilf nicht wirklich. Dann stark drauf drücken sonst bekommt man die Folie nicht ab ohne auch den Aufkleber wieder in der Hand zu habe. Ob die Aufkleber länger halten bezweifle ich stark aber da erst neu kann ich dazu nicht wirklich eine Aussage treffen. Ich würde mir die Aufkleber nicht mehr kaufen!
3,Looks good works okay doesn’t last very long mins started to peel after a week or so
2,Die Folien haben sich sehr schlecht auftragen lassen und sind nach einem Tag Benutzung leider gerissen grundsätzlich finde ich die Idee und das Produkt aber gut es hat seinen Zweck auch nach defekt noch halbwegs erfüllt
1,C’est compliqué à mettre en place et fragile.Une fois correctement installé on se rend compte que c’est inutile que ce empêcher de fermer correctement le boîtier.En bref je l’ai mis à la poubelle 3 jours après l’avoir collé ça fait bientôt un ans que j’ai mes AirPods et tus sont toujours en impeccable.
2,Inutile : les autocollants s’enlèvent rapidement et ne protègent alors plus rien du tout
4,These are Verry hard to install on the AirPods and are expensive for just stickers but glad I  got them as they are Verry good at what they say on the tin
3,Difficili da mettere
1,I had regular AirPods and they attacked dust into the case like anything. So when I got some AirPods pro's and saw this is was an instant buy. Huge mistake.These are pretty much impossible to get in place - almost always they hang over the AirPods slots in the case leading to a scratching hazard. They creased up and stuck to themselves on first installation.I get get a dust and bubble free screen protector on a phone every time. These are impossible.Sadly not fit for purpose.
3,Très compliqué à installer et très fragile
2,Poor product applied as instructions said and two days later the top one ripped! Not happy with the product at all! Would not recommend
2,Nonostante il prodotto sia ben fatto l’applicazione risulta piuttosto complicata  nulla di impossibile ma riuscire ad allinearlo perfettamente richiede un po’ di pazienza e precisione. Il più grosso difetto (motivo della mia valutazione) è che sostanzialmente avrete un solo tentativo di riuscita. Se come nel mio caso vi rendete conto a posteriori che l’allineamento non è perfetto sarà IMPOSSIBILE rimuovere la pellicola senza distruggerla (probabilmente a causa della sua potente colla)Ho dovuto cestinarla...
1,I thought that it would be nice to have something like that to avoid dust and steeldust remains always stick on the magnets. Idea is brilliant nothing to say that but i can call myself very experienced applicator for these type of stuff(protectors skins etc) and have good tools to do it. This thing is above expert level after proper application it leaves gap between the lid and the main body. I returned the item i have to find some other brand or maybe something else to keep the device clean.I wish i could recommend the item.
4,Super produit pour protéger l’intérieur du boîtier AirPods Pro. Par contre faut prendre son temps pour le placer car c’est fragile et pas toujours aisé surtout pour la couche inférieure.
3,Aparentemente todo perfecto pero al tercer día se desprendió un trozo de la pegatina... si bien parece de bastante buena calidad
4,il prodotto è ben fatto è in materiale metallico come dice in descrizione peccato solo che il taglio dei fori non è perfetto in quanto nella parte del coperchio in un paio di punti è leggermente più grande. il prezzo secondo me è troppo per il prodotto in se nota positiva è che elimina il fastidioso scricchiolio del coperchio
4,Da ich bei diversen True Wireless Kopfhörern das Problem hatte dass sich nach der Zeit Staub oder ähnliches in dem Case absetze durch das auf und zuklappen irgendwann unschöne Kratzer oder dunkle Flecken bildeten.Da mir Kopfhörer für knapp 240€ allerdings zu schade sind dafür habe ich mich dazu entschieden diese Folie zu kaufen.Es ist zwar eine fummelige Angelegenheit diese anzubringen allerdings lohnt es sich vor allem da ich finde das es echt schön aussieht und es die Airpods vor die oben genannten Schäden schützt.
4,Prodotto utile ma difficile da applicare.
2,L'ho installato e rimosso poco dopo l'applicazione delle pellicole non è così semplice come si legge nella descrizione del prodotto e la non perfetta adesione ha fatto si che nella parte inferiore del case si rompesse dopo poche ore di utilizzo. Per di più la difficoltà di posizionare correttamente la pellicola ha fatto sì che una AirPod si graffiasse a toglierla dalla confezione.
3,Das Anbringen war einfach. Aber die Anleitung ist von der Bebilderung evt zu verbessern. Trotz blasenfreier anbringung habe ich im geschlossen Zustand einen Spalt zwischen unter und Oberteil. Dieser wurde in der Produktbeschreibung explizit ausgeschlossen.
4,Le rendu est propre mais l’installation est compliquée et demande beaucoup de patience. Je recommande tout de même.
1,Ok spendere quasi 10€ per un sottilissima pellicola di metallo ma  l’applicazione non è impossibile ma alquanto complicata. Per poter applicare la pellicola senza che venga “attratta” dai magneti della chiusura degli airpods bisogna far in modo che la pellicola rimanga incollata al foglio adesivo che la sostiene ma tale foglio è troppo ingombrante per poter permettere una applicazione allineata. Per potersi inventare qualcosa di simile è necessario staccare la pellicola e successivamente applicarla a filo del supporto trasparente nel senso contrario in cui è stato applicato dalla fabbrica. Tutto questo per vederla staccarsi pochi giorni dopo l’applicazione a causa di un micron fuori linea durante l’applicazione (non perchè l’adesivo non sia sufficiente).A quel prezzo avrei studiato un aiuto all’applicazione nella confenzione.
3,Muy bien hecho pero no te durará nada se acaba levantando y rompiéndose
2,Unnötig da es nicht hält!
4,un buon prodotto
2,mediocre
1,Sono tagliati bene. Questa l’unica nota positiva-arrivano attaccati alla pellicola/guida al contrario di come sarebbe logico (mentre si attacca la parte “base” quella “coperchio” si deve piegare strofinandosi su di esso) per la cronaca  ipod ha il coperchio che si apre NON a 180°.- quando sono attaccati e l’ho fatto BENE essendo uno che lavora nella micromeccanica creano uno spessore che impedisce la chiusura in battuta del tutto con la comica risultante che rimane una fessura dalla quale entra la polvere. Vorrei ridere
5,Does the job and is good value for the money tricky to put on but it doesn’t help with my fat fingers! Would and have recommended to others because they look good in your AirPods Pro case
3,Etwas funneling richtig zu Fixieren allerdings machbar. An sich sehen die Folien super aus bei mir sind sie leider innerhalb eines Monats relativ schmutzig geworden. Dafür wird natürlich das AirPod Case selbst nicht so schmutzig.
5,Me parece que cumple su función pero tengo que decir que dos trocitos de papel por ese precio me parece caro... tengo que agregar que lo compre pensado que vendría un segundo par de repuesto... pero desde luego  no lo volveré a comprar por ese precio.
4,An sich top nur leider löst sich die Folie relativ schnell und dann fehlen kleine Ecken (arbeite aber auch in der Metallverarbeitung)Aufkleben hat sofort gepasst
1,Die Aufkleber befinden sich auf einer Folie. Allerdings sind die Aufkleber so dort aufgebracht dass sie von dort nicht direkt in das Gehäuse geklebt werden können. Also Folie zerschneiden und dann einkleben. Da die Aufkleber an vielen Stellen recht schmal sind ist dies ziemlich schwierig diese einzukleben. Sitzen die Aufkleber nicht sofort richtig ist eine Korrektur (abziehen ermeut aufkleben) nicht mehr möglich (ist mir passiert). Ich habe den Mist dann in den Mülleimer geworfen! Vielleicht kommen Uhrmacher damit klar ich leider nicht.Ich kann das Produkt nicht empfehlen!
5,Mi sento di dissentire rispetto alle altre recensioni trovate su questo prodotto se si seguono le istruzioni alla lettera con un po’ di mano ferma si ottiene un’ottima adesione e precisione del prodotto.Nonostante l’applicazione di coperture in gomma anche per gli auricolari il case si chiude veramente bene!È da vedere in futuro come si comporterà ma per ora non posso che essere soddisfatto.
4,Llegó pronto y muy fácil de ponerse
2,Esteticamente bello ma assolutamente non funzionale. Non facile applicarlo bene la pellicola è piccolissima in certi punti e visto che per estrarre una AirPod  è necessario infilare un dito  questo tocca la pellicola come si vede in foto e si stacca subito. Soldi buttati
3,Ist mir beim Aufkleben schon durchgerissen allgemein jedoch ein schöner und effektiver Schutz
4,Ottimo prodotto fa quello che promette!
2,Bringt fast garnicht‘s
1,These things are flimsy!! Spent a while getting everything aligned so as not to scratch my AirPods Pro. An hour later they’re broken. These things are an absolute con. You’d be better off putting your cash in the bin directly because these will end up there soon after you get them.
3,Difficile da istallare
2,After nearly a month of everyday use the protection started to chip off
1,Non seguono perfettamente la linea  si spezzano facilmente. Taglienti rischi di rovinare le cuffie e le dita come nel mio caso. Non le puoi rimuovere completamente. Come in foto è rimasto un lembo attaccato che non so come rimuovere. Posso essere rimborsato? Ho i resti del prodotto inutilizzabili ovviamente
1,This is perhaps one of THE worst product I’ve ever bought. “Easy installation” it says I wouldn’t even be mad if it had 2 or 3 in the pack but for that price you only get one it’s not sturdy metal it’s basically plastic. The installation process almost guarantees that they get ripped as they’re very fragile. Basically useless.
1,Beim abnehmen ist es abgebrochen und hat sich tief in meinem Finger geschnitten und habe mehrere Minuten gebraucht bis es ansatzweise aufgehört hat zu bluten daher leider nur einen Stern!Produkt an sich nicht schlecht man muss aber vorsichtig sein beim Abmontieren!
2,Works for the intended use however broke within two days of applying them to my case overall disappointing
3,Sieht optisch super aus nur das drauf kleben war ein wenig schwer
2,It looks great but scratches easily and in my case prevented the case from closing completely
2,Dopo poco si è spezzato e scollato
1,Uno dei prodotti più inutili che abbia mai comprato. Si è scollato dopo pochi giorni non aderisce al bordo interno della custodia e come se non bastasse non ferma in alcun modo polvere o sporco. Soldi buttati.
1,I’ve bought two of these now. The first didn’t go on very well as it’s very fiddly to fit. Thought it may just be me so bought another and filled the instructions to the letter. Still really fiddly and the bottom part broke as it’s so thin in one section.
4,Preis bisschen hoch aber es schützt geht aber auch leicht kaputt
1,No es lo que se ve no vale para nada
1,Tras seguir un tutorial de Youtube tutorial de la misma marca que vende el producto ya que las instrucciones son bastante escuetas y complicadas de entender instalé el producto en mi AirPods Pro. Sinceramente no es nada fácil su instalación aun así quedó perfecto todo a la primera y visualmente genial. Tras un par de aperturas y cierres al día siguiente la parte de debajo estaba rota por la parte más fina es demasiado endeble y el pegamento no actúa como debe.El precio es abusivo para un producto que en la mayoría de los casos no funciona y si funciona es durante un tiempo determinado en mi caso ha sido un solo día absurdo el coste del producto para lo que se obtiene y la fiabilidad de dicho producto.
1,It stops your case from closing properly is very hard to install and will break very easily. It only makes it look a bit nicer but it is not worth it and has too many downsides.
4,Habe zwar die Anleitung nicht verstanden die „Installation“ hat aber auch so funktioniert. Sieht sehr schick aus und Box schließt weiterhin gut.
2,Very flimsy sticking-guide not so useful for alignment.
2,Plus efficace sur les AirPod classique la protection est trop fragile pour AirPod pro.
2,Installed correctly and AirPod case won’t close all the way
1,Worthy of zero stars. I knew to expect something delicate and had watched several videos of people installing similar products. Instructions were unhelpful and it proved that difficult to remove from the backing plastic that it ripped. You’re probably it better of just cleaning the inside of the case regularly.
5,bonne idée mais l’autocollant part avec le temps :(
3,Se despega con facilidad y se quiebra a los pocos días.
1,It’s very hard to center on instillation an because of this it broke an now I have a bit stuck in the lid. Not worth the money it lasted ten minutes.
1,Although these are a good idea and look nice when first installed they are not something that practically works. When the lid is tilted back they catch on the AirPods slightly and move position this continues every time they are opened and has not ripped due to this
1,Das anbringen ist etwas friemelig. Man muss den "Sticker" mit einer Transferfolie auf das Case übertragen. Ohne Übung ist das aber doch etwas schwer und man hat nur eine Chance.Bei mir war der "Sticker" am Ende nicht 100% korrekt justiert. Nachjustieren ist aber nahezu unmöglich.Bisher habe ich sich noch nicht so richtig verstanden/bemerkt was jetzt mit dem Sticker besser sein soll 🙈Würde das Produkt nicht noch einmal kaufen.
1,Il materiale metallico risulta tagliente la dimensione troppo precisa se applicata qualche decimo di millimetro fuori posto (cosa che a mano non solo è probabile ma quasi inevitabile per tanto che ci si possa impegnare e seguire tutte le indicazioni... qui si parla davvero anche solo di uno o due decimi di millimetro!) risulta tagliente e segna in modo irreparabile gli auricolari creando un vero e proprio solco.Se sporge anche solo di pochissimo risulta tagliente.Assolutamente sconsigliato quasi 10€ buttati via.
5,Works absolutely fine. Instructions was clear and I had no problems.Used this before on my non pro air pods.
2,Pellicola antipolvere come protezione Interna per Apple Airpods PRO Grigio Satinato:fa bene quel che deve fare ma l'applicazione è odiosa!
2,Kaum montiert nach dreimal offnen bricht schon eine ecke ab
1,ich habe mir die folie bestelt weil ich nur gutes gehört habe aber die folie hat nach 3 stunden schon nicht mehr richtig geklebt und zurück schicken konnte ich sie auch nicht. nach 4 tagen sah sie dann auch schon so wie auf den bildern aus Oben und unten schon weg gebrochen. Muss echt nicht sein.MfG
5,Ich habe mir diesen Staubschutz für meine neuen AirPods Pro gekauft da ich bei den alten AirPods der 2. Generation immer das Problem hatte das die Oberfläche stark beschmutzt war. Ich habe diesen Staubschutz an meinen AirPods Pro jetzt angebracht und ich muss echt sagen es sieht sehr schön aus und es HAFTET sehr gut! Das Anbringen klappt sehr einwandfrei und ist leicht. Da die Verarbeitung sehr ordentlich gemacht ist bei diesem Produkt vergebe ich dies mit 5 Sternen. Ich kann dieses Produkt jedem AirPod Besitzer weiter empfehlen der seine AirPods vor Staub Schmutz und Kratzern schonen möchte. ;)
1,Sah am Anfang wirklich schön aus doch nach knapp 4 Wochen auf den Airpods löst sich die Folie oben schon auf und blättert ab... Die Reste landen leider im Case der Airpods und sind nur schwer wieder rauszubekommen. Bei der Betitelung „14K Gold“ hatte ich wenigstens eine längere Haltbarkeit erwartet deshalb leider nur 1 Stern.
5,Produit de très bonne qualité et simple à installer en regardant la vidéo sur YouTube
1,Fitted perfectly for approx 4 open and closes of the case. the top skin then split and came away like a flap.had to remove to avoid damaging the air pod. as another reviewer said just clean your AirPods regularly instead.
2,Not reliable
2,carini facili da applicare peccato che la versione colorazione oro in realtà sia color argento la foto deprodotto è errata
1,Beim Trennen der beiden Schutzfolien blieb die Goldfolie auf der falschen Seite kleben. Beim Abziehen/ Versuch die Goldfolie auf die richtige Seite zu drehen ging die Goldfolie kaputt und konnte nicht mehr am Case angebracht werden. Beschreibung zum Anbringen war auch sehr schlecht. Ich kann vom Kauf nur abraten.
2,Pas facile à installer et impossible à repositionnerJe n’y suis pas arrivé proprement
1,Pessimo prodotto arrivato nella confezione piegato a metà ho deciso di montato lo stesso molto difficile da installare essendo di metallo la calamita delle AirPods lo “attira” nei punti fuori sagoma dopo circa 2 giorni di utilizzo si è già staccato un pezzo per il prezzo pagato mi aspettavo più qualità.
4,Me encanta aunque con algunos problemas en el momento de pegarlo
5,Colore space greyOttima protezioneUnica pecca un po’ difficile il montaggio è molto sottile tanto è vero che durante l’installazione mi si è rotto ma comunque sono riuscita ad applicarlo!
5,Brilliant product would recommend
1,Überteurter Prei!!Hält trotz richtiger Anbringung nicht länger als ein Tag. (obwohl ich mir extra das Youtube video dazu angeschaut habe wie man es richtig dran macht!!!!)Und dank den scharfen metall ränder haben die sogar meine airpods zerkratzt dankeschön!!!!!!!!!Ich empfiehl jeden die nicht zu kaufen laut meiner erfahrung wenn man die airpods regelmäßig sauber macht dann erfüllt das auch den zweck.
1,Single most frustrating thing I’ve had done in the last 10-20 years. Doesn’t fit properly. No matter how careful you are there is always an edge that could potentially cut into my headphones.
2,La pellicola è tagliente Quando si prendono le cuffie ci si taglia il dito
4,Dieser Artikel hat eine guten Qualität. 👍
1,Had to return as don’t fit correctly. The magnetic seemed like good idea but it caused them to magnet together in sticking them from case if makes sense
1,Heute bekommen. Leider ist das Aufbringen ein Roulette Spiel.  Die Metallfolie lässt sich von der ersten Trägerfolie löschen. Danach ist es ein Ding der Unmöglichkeit die "Metallfolie auf das Gehäuse aufzubringen - seihe Foto.999€ für ein nicht zu installierendes Produkt. Ok wenn man es vielleicht mit der Nagelschere ordentlich ausschneidet dann geht es.  -  Definitiv nicht kaufen
5,Vraiment parfait installation bien plus facile que certains disent ! Il suffit d’être précis et de ne pas être trop brusque. L’autocollant de pose aide vraiment beaucoup!
1,Really bad fitting. Items arrived in the box with poor quality and metal easy to break. Nearly damaged my AirPod but luckily removed it. Do not buy it.
1,Poor quality broke apart easily not engineered with the tolerances to be a perfect fit on a very small surface area. Would not recommend.
1,Bellissima a vedersi ma quando ho attaccato la pellicola sulla parte inferiore questa non aderiva. Alla fine si è rotta in un punto mentre cercavo di togliere la parte trasparente e in un altro mentre cercavo di sistemarla. Ho provato a salvarla ma niente da fare se non aderisce subito si può direttamente buttare.Proverò a fare il reso ammesso che accettino un articolo rotto. Peccato!
1,Application aids didn't work or make sense at all so the metal snapped and applied badly. Nice colour but not worth the money.
1,It's too fiddly to put on then when your taking one of the headphones out it kept getting caught on the dust guard
1,Not great Pulled it apart as stated to stick it on my case but soon as I started to pilled apart it snapped
5,Dimensioni perfette per le AirPods Pro.Fanno quel che è dichiarato: proteggono dalla polvere.Un acquisto ottimo da fare per preservare il case delle nostre cuffie 🥸
1,Absolutely useless. I installed the pieces as per instructions and one still simply crumbled as soon as I closed the lid. Don’t go near this.
5,Producto fantástico. Muy vistoso le da un aspecto de lujo a la caja de los AirPods que es bastante espartana. El dorado combinado con la funda de la misma marca en color azul queda espectacular. La instalación es algo compleja y se puede romper con facilidad si no se tiene cuidado.
1,Ich habe den Staubschutz drauf gemacht und nach 5 min wollte ich meine AirPods Pros raus hohlen und dann bin ich am am Staubschutz dran gekommen und es ist kaputt gerissen.Das unterste teil für die AirPods Pro ist zu knapp bemessen und passt garnicht richtig :/
5,Pour mes écouteurs
4,Der Staubschutz sieht gut aus. Lässt sich etwas schwierig aufkleben auf YouTube gibt es eine Anleitung vom Herstellers selbst.Jetzt mal schauen wie lange die halten.
1,Quite difficult to align when installing. Very flimsy and didn’t last very long. Therefore not worth the money at all.
1,Rubbish I'm very u happy about this iem and I would like to get replacement extremely hard to install the stick broke in half
1,Bestimmt ein tolles Produkt. Würde man auch zwei Aufkleber bekommen. Wenn der eine den ich bekommen habe auch noch heil und unbenutzt wäre dann würde es noch relativ ok sein. Aber sowas geht gar nicht
1,Very sharp also super difficult to apply. The stickers are so thin. Not worth the money at all!
1,beaucoup trop fragile se casse trop facilement ah abîmez mes airpods à cause d’un bout décollezse déchire quand on l’enlève il reste collé au endroit qu’ont ne peut atteindre NUL NUL NUL
1,Waste of time not durable at all. Split within the first day of having them installed.
5,Añade una cierta elegancia al estuche de los Air Pods Pro de Apple. Impide que el polvo se acumule en las hendiduras. De todas formas se trata de una lámina muy fina y frágil. La parte superior se coloca fácilmente la inferior cuesta más.
1,Fitting instructions very poor if not fitted correctly product damages the AirPods not fit for purpose ended in the bin.
1,Ich habe die Dustguards in der hoffnung bestellt sie würden meine Airpods schützen als ich jedoch versucht habe sie anzubringen haben die dustguards nicht mal geklebt was das ganze produkt überflüssig machte. Ich habe es genau so gemacht wie in der Anleitung sogar ein Video habe ich mir angesehen
1,So difficult to fit the instructions make little sense. Got fed up in the end and sent it back.
1,Article de mauvaise qualité c’est cassé au décollage du support article inutilisable 9.99€ à la poubelle !!!
1,Not worth the money very fragile and extremely hard to apply. I ended up throwing 10£ away
1,It doesn’t stick onto my airpods pro. I followed the instructions and it doesn’t work
5,Die Sticker tuen was sie sollen - verhindern dass kleinste Metallpartikel die Innenseite der AirPods Case zerkratzen.Das Anbringen ist ein wenig fummelig aber in 10 Minuten getan. Die Anleitung ist (anders als in anderen Rezensionen beschrieben) auf Englisch Chinesisch und zusätzlich noch in einfach zu verstehenden Piktogrammen beschrieben.Die Sticker sind an manchen Stellen weniger als einen Millimeter breit also unbedingt beim Anbringen aufpassen - sie können schnell reisen!
1,Les fines parties de ce produit lié aux frottement des ouvertures et fermeture se sont sectionnés.Anti poussière mais l'effet brillant amène des traces de doigts.Donc produit cassé et pas esthétique...
5,Ottimo prodotto. La qualità de brevetto si vede e la polvere all’interno della custodia non è presente. Consigliato
1,Le istruzioni sono esattamente l’opposto di ciò che ti ottiene rendendo il tutto un caos che porta alla rottura immediata del prodotto
1,Top part broke after a couple days. Now after a week the paint is peeling. Not worth the price.
5,Excellent would recommend
1,Once installed AirPod case won’t fully close.Very poor.Returned for a refund.
1,Not worth it
1,Broke on me waste of money I think
1,Gute Idee das Case vor Staub und Schmutz zu schützen.Das Anbringen am Case ist viel zu umständlich und könnte viel einfacher gelöst werden. Gehalten hat es genau 38 Sekunden bis ich den unteren Teil wieder entfernt und entsorgt habe.Brauch ich persönlich nicht wieder.
1,DO NOT BUY! Ripped hours after putting it on the case. Waste of money
5,Brought to make my case look flash
1,Awful ripped so easily took it off after a few days waste of money!!
1,Worse item doesn't fit at all
5,Excellent product A*
1,Took it out off packaging and was broke and missing a section
1,Too hard to put it on it was waste of money
1,Expensive and hard to apply not worth the money
1,trop trop fragile a fuirpour la mise en place il faut de la chance preferez jouer au loto plus de chanceen plus bord mal ajusté et coupant pour les ecouteurs
1,It split with the first try even though I followed the instructions
1,NICHT ZU EMPFEHLEN!! Habe es seit ein paar Tagen im Gebrauch und es sieht einfach nur gruselig aus. Dünnes rissiges billiges Material!!!KEINE KAUFEMPFEHLUNG!!! Spart euch das Geld!!!Von mir gibt es 0 Sterne!
1,Nul !👎🏽
5,Work perfectly. Extremely fast delivery.
1,Lässt sich nur sehr schlecht justieren und reinkleben und durch das auf und zu klappen nutzen sich die Dinger ab und reißen an der dünnsten Stelle. Fazit: unnötiger Murks und Geldverschwendung.
5,Bel design bel materiale ottimo effetto visivo. Comprate proprio perchè erano spuntati dei segni neri dentro la custodia. Consigliatissimo
1,J’ai voulu le remplacer et finalement à peine posé déjà abîmé pour ne pas dire cassé. Vraiment déçu.A éviter absolument.
1,Produit scandaleux. Impossible à positionner correctement. Se déchire à la moindre manipulation du coup impossible de le retourner. Produit à éviter absolument sauf si vous aimez jeter votre argent par les fenêtres.
1,avoid at all costs.
1,Nicht zu empfehlen!Anleitung nur auf Chinesisch plus 4 Bilder die komplett unverständlich sind.Außerdem reisen die Sticker bei der kleinsten Berührung!!Finger weg verbrennt das Geld dann habt ihr mehr davon
1,Not as described.
5,Oltre alla pulizia bello da vedere
5,Super produit
1,Produit top à la description Sauf que je l'ai reçu avec une tâche noire. Impossible de l'enlever.
1,Schrott bringt nichts ganz ehrlich das anzubringen ist der übelste knifflig gewesen und ja was soll ich sagen man sollte sich das Geld sparen
1,Not good quality ripped off the same day teared around thin edges and left marks on my earbuds total waste of my hard earned money
1,Der letzte Schrott. Bricht auseinander und dann liegen die kleinen Teile unten in der Aufnahme für die AirPods. Magnetisch und schwer zu entfernen.
1,Dieses so genannte Staubschutz ist einfach nicht zu empfehlen es gibt keine richtige Einleitung und für diesen Preis er wartet man bisschen mehr.
1,Letzte Müll bei der Montage schon kaputt gegangen und dafür knapp 10€ ist ein Witz !Da kann ich das Geld nehmen indexes auch direkt verbrennen
1,Adesivo pessimo dalla prima apertura dell’involucro mi sono trovato già un pezzettino di adesivo staccato. Facendo alcune ricerche ho scoperto essendo di materiale ferroso potrebbe rovinare le batterie del case. 10 euro buttati
5,Perfetti e funzionanti.Molto soddisfatta.Consegna perfetta.
1,1. Super hard to install2. Material is too flimsy3. Material chipped off on second daySave your money and do not buy these!
1,Sehr schlechte QualitätEinmal fest gemacht und AirPods pro zu geklappt dann wieder auf und klebt Beide Teile von eine Seite das die direkt zerreißt
1,Produit trop compliqué à installer de par sa fragilité et des explications quasi inexistantes... Vraiment dommage
5,Guardando i video è molto facile da installare
1,Das Metall ist so scharf dass ich mir meine Finger gschnitten habe! Außerdem haben sie meine Airpods zerkratzt.
1,Molto bello lo stile che ottiene il case delle AirPods solo che è durato 10 minuti attaccatoSeguendo le istruzioni trovate su YouTube
5,Ok
1,BUONASERA OGGI SIAMO TORNATI ACASAABBIAMO TROVATO L'ARTICOLO NELLA CASETTA DELLA POSTA FELICISSIMI NON APPENA INCOLLATI GLI ADESIVI GUARDATE COME SONO DIVENTATI ALLA SECONDA APERTURA PER FAVORE CONSIGLIATEMI VOI COME MI DEVO COMPORTARE.GRAZIE MILLEFLOREAN
1,si sono staccate dopo poche ore .... non hanno nemmeno la funzione estetica vista durata della loro posizione praticamente nulla.
5,Passt genau in die AirPods Pro Hülle. Beim Einkleben etwas aufpassen dann passt es aber perfekt. Man kann es auch noch einmal vorsichtig lösen und etwas verschieben. Erfüllt seinen Zweck und sieht sehr hochwertig aus.
1,Non è facile installarlo perfettamente allineato e se ci riuscite come è capitato a me il bordo è fastidiosamente tagliente e inoltre si è staccato in meno di un mese
1,Ist nicht gut und wenn Mann das aufklebt ist auch sehr schwer zu bekleben
5,Todo correcto se ajustan muy bien a la caja de los AirPods . La verdad es que queda protegido y bonito.

1,Impossibile montarlo senza romperlo
1,Pessimo veramente.Non si adatta e si spacca subito oltre al fatto che diventa subito ossidato.Troppo costoso e non ne vale la pena.

1,Es muy difícil de instalar y una vez puesto es una atrapa pelusa de maravilla.El adhesivo que se engancha a la funda de los AirPods se sale de el "protector" y queda lleno de restos de pega y suciedad.

2,A pesar que leí las instrucciones para instalación me resulto muy difícil colocarlo correctamente básicamente se rompió y lo tuve que retirar parecía una buena idea pero tire mi dinero al comprar este accesorio no lo recomiendo.
1,These are VERY hard to install and not durable they ripped immediately
5,Cumple lo que promete solo hay que tener mucho cuidado al instalar
5,I have read some reviews saying how difficult it is to install. I just took my time and had no issues. Now I have protection and I like the look of the gold when I open it. Recommended.
1,I followed the instructions and put them on very precise but my case refuses to close properly. I do not recommend this product
5,Vale la pena comprarlo únicamente necesitan clarificar un poco las instrucciones de instalación
5,Protege muy bien mis AirPods de la suciedad.
4,Es difícil de colocar se rompe muy fácil con el uso. Sí protege de la entrada de polvo pero solo por un tiempo pronto se rompe y deja entrar el polvo. Muy caro para lo que dura.
4,Es difícil de colocar se rompe muy fácil con el uso. Sí protege de la entrada de polvo pero solo por un tiempo pronto se rompe y deja entrar el polvo. Muy caro para lo que dura.
3,Muy fácil de colocar. Pésima calidad. Se rompe muy fácil. Se puede apreciar en las imágenes. Considero el material debe ser más resistente. Ha sido alrededor de un mes el que he tenido el producto.
1,Difícil de poner y la lámina es frágil
2,S’est brisé en installant
3,not clear instructions with no easy way to find a video to  help  installation
1,This products is nice but very cheaply made. I used it for a week and the sticker part start to comes offDoesn’t not stick on for long. Wasn’t happy but already used it. But would never buy it again
1,Si tu le met pas correctement si ça toujours s’enlever...
1,Me llego roto
2,Es extremadamente delicado solo duro bien una semana después se rompió y se cayó como hoja de papel es preferible retirarlo. No tiren su dinero a la basura
2,Los protectores dan muy buena vista al case de los airpods pero son sumamente difíciles de colocar en sus lados mas angostos aunque eso no es lo peor mas tarde te darás cuenta que no valió la pena tanta precisión a la hora de ponerlos ya que carecen de un buen pegamento y fácilmente se desprenden en mi opinión no los recomiendo.
5,Me encantó encaja perfecto le falta tantito más pegamento pero bien instalado es suficiente.
5,Muy difícil colocar se rompen con facilidad estorban al sacar los air
3,Buen precio para lo que es las instrucciones de instalación son muy confusas y no viene vínculo ni buena ilustración que te diga cómo instalarlo se rompieron en el proceso de instalado
3,I bought these for my AirPods Pro after my last AirPods built up those black stains from the magnets. After just under a year the sticker started peeling and ripping to the point I had to take it off.However for the time I had it it did its job. By my first year of having Airpods the black markings started to show and the crevasses were covered in lint from my pocket and dust. But the sticker I had prevented the black markings and these Airpods are much much cleaner than my original pair was by the time I've had my current pair.So while this dust guard is frustrating to install and doesn't last too long under normal everyday use it does work and offers a clean look and aesthetic. Just not for very long.Paired with a sturdy case a little bit more care when using and LOTS of patience this dust gaurd could help keep your AirPods clean and retain the resell value of your AirPodsSo long as you don't tear them during installation.
5,I don’t feel the negative reviews are warranted. This product is made with tight tolerances which I will always favour instead of products built with an acceptable margin for error.The stickers are made out of foil and require some pressure to “activate” the adhesive so you can remove and reposition as needed (as I did probably close to 10x total for both parts). Just make sure you support the peeled portions as you slowly continue to remove entire piece. If it’s not dead centre you run the risk of scratching your AirPods as the edges are razor sharp.I can’t tell how they will hold up over time but so far so good and they look pretty darn nice.Watch the tutorial on YouTube a few times until you can memorize the steps and take your time! Do it under a lamp and use a magnifying glass if you wish. I really enjoyed installing these stickers and the precision behind it.
2,VERY HARD INSTALL overpriced for what it is looks good when installed but not worth your money
1,All of the other reviews don’t lie the sticker is difficult to apply and even worse to stay on. The rear cutout of the bottom sticker along the hinge of the case is too long and tends to get folded. It didn’t even last two days before it started flaking and a piece completely ripped off the top sticker.
1,It broke right when I took it out of the plastic
4,I like the colour they offer
4,Es fácil de despegar
3,MUY delicado para poner se troza muy fácil y hay poco margen de error si que da 1 micro milímetro desfasada puede perjudicar el audífono rompió una funda que traía
1,The idea of the product was amazing and I believe it still is however the product was not easy to install and the instructions on installation were not clear. I believe the box itself said it was to come with a stick for lining up the guard and that didn’t even come with the product. It broke and ripped before I could even put it on and it was a waste of my money
5,Queda súper linda y queda perfectamente
1,no es caro pero no sirve para nada se despegó a los pocos días de que lo instalé (3 para ser exacto) comenzó a levantarse y ME RAYÓ UNO DE LOS AIRPODS mejor se lo quité para evitar más daños definitivamente me extraña de esta marca pero este accesorio tiene una calidad pésima
1,No se instalan con facilidad no se ajustan se rompen al poco tiempo rozan los auriculares al extraerlos.
5,Fabulous!!
1,It was installed correctly. Not that sticky so I guess it was moving out of place. I opened the lid to grab my AirPods and it cut my finger to a point that I was dripping blood everywhere. I was in public too. Couldn’t risk it happening again so I had to peel it off.
1,No me gusto por que el adhesivo es muy debil y la placa metalica muy delicada se termino callenso
4,Hard to install with large fingers
4,Se batalla con la colocación del molde inferior muy delgado y se rompe
2,The dust guard made for airpods pro  does not accurately fit. It had some loose end’s that made it rip and come off.
