5,I purchased this watch for myself and I just can't say enough about it. I mean it started with needing something to just track my steps so I didn't want to spend too much on it. I found this and you just can't beat it the price and all the many features that it has. It's not bulky nice alternative to having to hold your phone when you're working out or taking a walk. The battery life on it is absolutely amazing and one of my favorites is that it monitors your blood pressure heart rate those are pretty awesome features that comforts me as I’m striving to live a healthier lifestyle. My husband has something similar and he paid way more then I did.  I absolutely love everything about it. I will definitely be handing these out as gifts this year.
5,This is the wife here. And I love this watch. Very comfortable and the ease of set up is awesome. I had the DB12 smart watch from the same company and I wore that all day everyday. I got the pink/purple and it is a great color. I like that it has 2 wrist band clasps to hold the extra band close to your wrist and it doesn’t get caught on anything (hope that makes sense). Packaged great. Came on time. I also bought the shockproof protector case for the watch and it is awesome as well
5,The bp and heart rate tracking is a must for me.  This watch has everything I need to keep track of my health.  My stats have been proven accurate and for that I am well pleased.  Bonus:  the watch is absolutely gorgeous!!  I am thrilled to wear it.
5,This fitness tracker is great!  I appreciate how user-friendly it is once you download the app via the QR code provided.  It tracks your blood pressure blood O2 level HR and more!  This offers 20 workout modes to suit your fancy.  The silicone watch band has a lot of holes for adjustability and is very comfortable!  The face of the watch is large so I can see it easily with my aging eyes.  Definitely recommend it!
