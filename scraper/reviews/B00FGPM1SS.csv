5,These work great. I've installed them all and will be buying more. I tried generic brands and they needed to almost be touching as well as having cheap double sided tape. These come with good 3m tape that won't fall off. The chime is louder than the alarm but it's nice to know when my screen doors are opened especially after an attempted break in. These along with battery powered motion lights have made thieves stay away.
5,These have been a lifesaver for a toddler. They do not connect to wifi. They are super simple to install they hold firm and are loud enough to be heard throughout our larger apartment. We used them to make sure our little guy doesn't get out without us knowing.
5,I bought these because I have toddlers that can reach and operate the deadbolt on the doors and they like to run outside when the adults are in a different room.  I put them on the back door front door and garage door to the house and they are loud enough that you can hear them in every room of the house.  I mostly just use the “bing bong” noise so I know if the door was opened but the buzzer alarm works great too.Overall they are an excellent purchase and I definitely recommend them.
4,This window/doors sensor is what i needed for my house. They are small and easy to install. The only catch is that when it gets to hot outside or even inside of the house the units come off the windows or doors. The adhesive material needs to be of a stronger hold to preserve the efficiency of the devices. When one piece of the unit is not longer next to the other it renders inefficient. But over all i like this item
4,I know when the doors open Garage door opens loud enough to let  people outside  know  PRETTY LOUD.but this is what I wanted  Security.
4,All I have to say is if you use this on a door or window you use frequently or even infrequently.. don’t forget to turn the alarm off… you’ll pee yourself. I’m not sure who would be more scared: me or a burglar
5,Bought this for added security on my daughters bedroom window since she’s on the other side of the house.  She’s 3 and we have a monitor in her room still which I’m certain I would hear over it although I’m not confident I would hear it if the monitor was off and I was asleep.We also put it on the back slider door because she has been known to try to go outside on her own the ding option is good for that and though it hasn’t happened I’m sure I would hear it if she opened the door solo.I will add that the adhesive slid off of the one on the slider door and it fell to the floor and left button batteries on the floor.  Not good since I have babies.  I did find it and hot glued it back to the door.  It happened AGAIN.  After some thinking and investigating I found out the piece was scraping the top of the doorway mid way (we have an older home and it’s apparently not super level) which I believe loosened the adhesive both times.  I glued it back up and have not had issues since.Overall pleased with this product.
5,Got these due to my eloper so we’d hear If he opened door. The one setting is super loud so perfect easy to install although only fit 2/3 of my doorframes. Easy to turn on/ off.
5,These detectors are great to make sure doors or windows are closed.  They have a warning that is loud enough to wake a person.  Simple and easy to install over a year on the battery life.
4,Primero creo que la tapa de las baterias queda muy floja osea se abre con facilidad incluso cuando solo intentas encender o apagar la alarma en segundo lugar esperaba un sonido de alerta mas fuerte
