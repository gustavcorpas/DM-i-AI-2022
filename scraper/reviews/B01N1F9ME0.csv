5,Buena calidad el producto llego r√°pido
5,I print hundreds of badges for my job and these worked great and got here quick. Couldn't be happier.
5,I work for a small college and we make student and special event badges all the time.  These are dye-sub ribbons for the badge printer.  We are also looking to put more visual elements on the badges.  The nice thing about these cartridges is that they use the same amount of film regardless of how much stuff is on the badge. Each cartridge is good for 250 cards so it's easy to determine when we will need to have them on the shelf.  If the film is a little loose when you take the cartridge out of the box you will need to tighten it by manually rolling the middle of the take-up reel.
5,Great product and quick delivery
