4,Not the best quality and dont last very long without tightening them again but for the price it's expected.
5,On the test card no blue light damage was made. I don’t know if these actually benefit your eyes at all nor do I care to be honest. I really just like the color and shape of these glasses. Buy it. It’s worth it 😆!
5,Super cute and definitely reduced my headaches at my desk job
4,This product is quite comfortable but when I tried them on they were a lot larger then I would expect. I haven't worn them that much (I really didn't need them I just wanted to not have bad eyesight from too much screentime.) But when I do I am concerned about my appearance because of the lens size. At first I did not see how large they were. I think that it is a good purchase and is a good price overall. I would buy it again.
5,I was looking for some wider lense anti blue light glasses that were a bit bigger for my head shape. And these are perfect the brown ones are my fav as of right now but I’ve always loved glasses I just couldn’t find ones that complimented me.They are real I can tell because if the blue glare on the side of the lense that recieves light like you can see the blue bouncing off. Also everything has a slight yellower tint like not like sunglasses but everything warmer toned which is great because my eyes can’t take this virtual school and everything being on technology. I get headaches pretty bad and have insomnia and I’m sure it’s because of my phone and stuff.Only cons I have :1.) I can see my eyes reflection in the lense as I’m seeing like I was thinking the glasses were scratched but it was the movement of my own eye reflecting off the lense into my vision so I could see my eye and I was mildly annoyed but that’s just a me thing lol.2.) Also a me thing but the parts of the glasses that go behind your ears HURTS. Like I wrapped tissue around the back of them because overtime it would have pressure against the area behind my ear. But it was fixable 👍🏾Pictures included!
5,Antes de tener estos lentes sentía mucho ardor en los ojos por el continuo uso de aparatos electrónicos… ha mejorado mucho mi visión y también se ven geniales
5,I have a pair I leave at work and wear them all day. I think they do a really good job blocking out the blue light--though I'm not sure it really does anything--just trying to help me eyes any way I can I guess. They are VERY flimsy so I've been pretty gentle with them and I don't think leaving them in the bottom of a backpack with other heavy stuff would be a good idea. They haven't fallen apart yet.
5,I thought I would give these a try since I stream and have been getting more headaches. I’m so glad I did so! No more headaches and they’re super cute! Plus three to choose from is some cool beans. Definitely recommend!!!
5,Not only are these glasses adorable they are great with helping to block blue light from devices. I'm a teacher and in front of a computer or other device for a good portion of the day and these glasses have severely reduced the headaches I receive.
5,I love the brown one the most of the 3 style wise; however they do work well. The price was great and it was packaged well (just as shown in the video).
5,Muy buena calidad
4,She doesn’t care for the black one but absolutely loves the other two.

5,The children love them. They are truly light wt and anti glare.
5,Great product block the blue light and they make you look 17x times smarter than you is.
1,Really uncomfortable on the nose honestly. I’m guessing it’s more for noses on the thinner side. Even just after a few minutes of wearing it’s irritating and just feels so uncomfortable on the nose area honestly can’t wear them for long will be returning.
1,Item no as described. The blue glare makes eyes hurt. The lenses aren’t clear as they look in the picture of the item
1,Just poor quality plastic and the picture is completely different! Completely unable to block blue light do not waste money!
