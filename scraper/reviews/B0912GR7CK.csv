4,certainly better than those stupid vent clip holders. My wife's car has limited room for a phone mount as most mounts would either leave the phone blocking many of the controls or the block parts of the radio screen. This mount has a small arm that gets the phone away from blocking anything. The magnet is strong and the metal phone plates are minimal. Both pivot points lock down securely when tightened. The adhesive end seems to be holding for now but time and the heat of summer will be the real test. I would buy this again- I'll upload a pic when I get a chance.
5,The mounts that came with the Car Thing just didn't put the screen in a place where I could see it with sunglasses on. This gave me the option to put it in a spot that the screen would show up clearly and not be in a dangerous place. The magnet is ridiculously strong and I don't think I will ever have to worry about bumps knocking the Car Thing off the dash. The mounts snaps together easily and comes with metal plates to put on devices so it can be used with almost anything. Great product and great price.
4,This is so far the only one I could use with my car (2015 Elantra) because there is literally no spot for a standard phone mount. I have this under and off to the side of my head unit. The item comes with extras of everything which is also great.
5,I love this product so far. I don‚Äôt have a lot of places to mount a phone holder on my dash but this product was able to get my phone positioned right where I wanted it.
4,Better for vertical mounting and odd shaped dashboards. Magnets could be stronger but no complaint
5,I have a 2013 Ford explorer and this mount almost looks like it was designed for this suv.  There is a spot next to the display where this mount is a perfect fit
4,Ive had this 6 weeks and i grabbed my phone and the whole magnetic piece broke offüò°üò°- Seller reached out to me after reading my feedback and informed me they have a new and improved one and shipped it to me‚ù§  Received replacement so far so good
5,I purchased this item so that could mount my phone on my rowing machine during workouts.It turned out to be strong enough to hold my kindle fire hd 8 in place during workouts.The ability to make adjustments at both ends of the mount allows the mount to be adjusted to the perfect angle no matter where it is mounted.If you have a case on your device you will want to attach the metal plate to the outside of the case in order to get the best connection to the magnet.Would have to say that this mount is a very good buy and will easily meet the needs of most people looking for a good magnetic mount.
5,Good option for 2018 Lexis Es 350 so far the best option for adhesive holder for this car‚Ä¶
4,I bought this for my 22 f250 king ranch.  I tried two locations and the adhesive did not hold the unit either time.  On the dash it is the phone and cradle were pretty much verticle but on the console the cardle was horizantal.  The unit has been returned but i would like a few of the curved posts.  They will work for other applications that need an offset.  These have 17mm balls.
5,After trying many magnetic mounts I like this a lot. Event bought a second one. Its pretty strong flexible with good adhesion.
5,i bought it for my dad and it was a really good product it was way better than the one we had before. It hold his phone really well
5,I‚Äôm so glad I found this. I‚Äôve bought others but this one holds perfectly very sturdy even with my case over the phone. Would recommend and buy again.
5,I needed a magnetic mount for a small wifi camera on my motorhome. I didn't know if this would be strong enough magnet to hold this up. I am amazed that it works great since the monitor is much bigger than a cellphone.Highly recommend this product.
5,Easy to assemble. If used in static position (no jiggling like driving in a car) it holds the phone OK. If there is any movement like you would get just driving down a smooth road the phone just vibrates right off due to gravity. The magnet is covered by a very smooth plastic sheet. Most phone cases have a polished steel disk to mate with a magnet. Put the two together add gravity and a bit of vibration and the phone decides not to stick around.Later I found disks in the package to add to a phone. These seem to "stick" better than my phone case disk. Unfortunately they don't fit well on most phone cases.Update: I've been going through phone cases trying to find one that isn't slippery in the hand. Haven't found one yet that eqals a previous case but... The most recent case I tried has a beefier piece of metal and it has very fine ridges embossed into the metal. That VERY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES the holding power of the magnet on this  support. Changed my rating to a 5*. From my experience it seems that the metal plate on the phone or case is a major component of how well this performs.
4,Update: I bought replacement adhesive from eSamcore and this time left it to cure for 4 days. That seemed to work better.It worked for my car. I have an Audi Q5 and there is only one spot to the left of the steering wheel where I can place this and it worked. I followed the instructions cleaned the area and everything and then let it rest for 24 hours. After only 1 day of using it however it fell off. The adhesive didn't work. I'm not returning it. I just want to figure out a way to make it stick.
5,Works well and easy to install
5,I needed a unit like this for my Jeep and I didn't want my phone mounted on the dash.  The Base (3M) is very strong and the magnet is tough enough for off roading (and the phone doesn't fall).  Very happy with this.  Hope this helps and good luck
5,My daughter drives a 2012 Mazda 3.  It has an akward dash.  This fit perfectly to where the phone was accessable and not blocking the view.  Having the two adjustable pivot points with a screw to tighten them up is perfect.  No floppy phone mount here.
5,Only dash mount that has worked for me so far.
5,Easy too install hold phone great. Perfect device for vehicle.
3,The magnet is not strong enough to hold the weight of an iPhone 13 Pro. Still gets 3 stars because they let me return it for a refund. Product and packaging was great. I just assumed it had a stronger magnet but the 13's are heavier phones.
5,I put it on my dashboard about 1 month ago and its still going on strong.
5,I needed something small and had a long enough neck for my iPhone 13 pro max. This was perfect. I took the magnet off and replaced it with my lollilockit magnet because I have a pop socket on my phone. I needed the ball joint type magnet and something that stuck out far enough not to interfere with my dash. This works perfect. Doesn‚Äôt take up space no above dash mount in the way or on the window. I used to have the window mount but it I just replaced my windshield and didn‚Äôt want to put it back up. I recommend this to anyone who has an area of their dash that is smooth plastic which I think works best for adhesion. I‚Äôve been through many mounts and I‚Äôm happy with this one.
5,Pretty easy to install.
4,Good adhesion and holds my 6.1" phone perfectly. Magnet is pretty strong and the holder stays in position firmly. Does not look fancy though. Just some black plastic pieces but does the job. Recommended
3,It only lasted like 4 days stuck it fell off after like the 5th day
3,Giving 3 star rating based on holder design. Where this falls short is adhesion. Like strength of magnet and tension . But  will not stick to anything . Have Dakota and wouldn't stick to dashclear cluster glass or even windshield. Ended up pressing against dash and screwing in place. I tried adhesive pad and fell off without phone on it Couldn't. Even get 3M pads to stick to each other. It was 78¬∞ and cleaned with alcohol pad
5,Great adhesive power great magnetic power I found my car mount.The summers are HOT where I'm from so I dont keep it on the top of my dashboard the heat melts the adhesive after a while I put it more towards the front bottom of my dash and it's lasting a long time!
3,No fue muy buena imbersion el pegamento no es bueno se despegaba.
5,Great for small surfaces in your vehicle. Also the adhesive pad can easily be cut and modified!
4,Es c√≥modo lo √∫nico malo es la pega  dura como 3 meses compr√© otra pega a ver c√≥mo me va.
3,Magnet is great. Held my phone very well. The adhesive didn't last a whole day.
5,My car has very little room on the dashboard and it has a textured surface which makes it hard to create suction  every item I‚Äôve ever bought eventually falls off UNTIL NOW!  This product is amazing not only is it perfect for small areas because of the shape of adhesive but it grips onto uneven surfaces.  I love the movable piece you can rotate your phone easily and even move it left to right on the actual base I just can‚Äôt say enough about this product it‚Äôs absolutely perfect for my iPhone 13!  üëçüèºü§©ü§©ü§©
4,The tape on this was not strong enough to hold.  In fairness I was putting it on a slight curve and there was no way to weigh it down.  Even with my own Gorilla tape there is one edge that has trouble staying down.  Other than that this worked pretty good.  I needed one that was a little taller because where I wanted to put it the dash sticks up.  So it worked just about right for that.  Usually these plastic ball screw together types don't last in the AZ heat so we'll have to see.
3,Would not fit in my garmin (square peg round hole) but plenty strong enough to hold my phone
4,Thanks to the seller who messaged me to give advice after I complained that it was not adhering to my dashboard. The suggestion to run the heat for a bit solved the issue. Thank you for making the effort to help and offering to replace parts if needed!
4,Comes in a small 2"x4" pkg that includes everything you should need to mount your cell phone holder.UNFORTUNATELY  thier adhesive does not work very well üòï as a matter of fact...not at all! So you will have to purchase something else.Once you get it mounted it (appears) that it don't/won't take up much space and definitely isn't as bulky as most phone mounts. Plus it can pretty much be used anywhere..and not just on your window.I feel if you get some good adhesive. You would be able to also use it for a tablet or GPS mount as well.
3,main issue i had with it was after a couple weeks the adhesive started letting go. also I tighten the swivel down as tight as I can get it but it tends to still move on me.
5,I love this mount.Best mount I've ever bought.Very sturdygreat adhesive power.Highly recommend it.Thanks
5,Very good adhesion. Offers good flexibility to choose where you put it. If you hang it (like mine); it is a little bit shaky if the road is not good enough. It doesn't really hold iPhone 12 from MagSafe directly. You need the metal plate for secure fit. Quite good. Recommended for sure.
4,Tape came off after about a month of use
5,Incredible little gadget. Works perfectly and is so much safer than digging around for my phone!
3,Good price right size not overly complicated. However the magnetic pad does not have enough power to keep the phone steady. The alternative is to use higher friction material for the pad.
4,I like it works really well ..and it holds my phone the way I needed ..
2,The concept was good but the adhesive was bad. Did not hold at all so I tried the 2nd adhesive it came with and that didn't stick either :(
4,Vale lapena
5,El adhesivo es extrafuerte es de muy buena calidad el tel√©fono ni se mueve excelente producto y su precio es realmente bajo con respecto a la calidad
3,The frame worked great but the magnet could not hold the phone in place when car was in motion.  Phone would fall during turns.
4,A compact base a strong adhesive strip and very powerful rare-earth magnet make this not only effective but one of the best values in its class.
4,Pretty good it adheres well just one corner lifts up but so far holding on good. It came with two strips of adhesive one was already on the bottom and the other was a double it was a t little confusing on how to put it together so I just stuck both pieces.
5,I wish the magnet was stronger. That way the phone stays better be good.
5,Great small item with strong magnet. I use it to hold a 7 inch tablet magnet is really strong. It comes with extra 3m tape in case you need to relocate to other vehicle or different place. It also comes with 2 metal plaques.
5,Neede something smaller to fit where I wanted to mount it!  It‚Äôs easy to install and works perfect!
4,Very good phone mount just wish it held my phone a little higher cuz I like to use these kinds things to make time lapses.
2,The plastic "locking nut" broke and made it useless. The solid arm also limited it. If you mount it so the phone is straight up like in the description it'll be fine. If you need articulation to get around objects look elsewhere. Good holder for the right setup just not for mine and the plastic nuts seem pretty weak.
4,Everything was pretty good except for adhesive it sticks fine but if you're in the heat it will fall right off during the day. It held well just didn't beat Florida car temps.
5,This is definitely one of the best. I had been looking for something to put by the shifter center console and this is the one. I love it. And can move it around and put in so many positions
5,What a wonderful product and built very well very easy to install with everything you need to install.Very adjustable for every angle you need to hold your phone.I'll let all my friends know about it.
3,Very good product! The magnet is very strong how ever‚Ä¶ mine didn‚Äôt even stick on my car! I thought maybe because the plastic but i tried different parts of car to try and stick it on but it doesn‚Äôt not stick anywhere! Now i need to go buy something that can make it stick better to my car. Very weak!!!
3,Missing one screw cap. It didn't work. I returned it.I changed rating from one star to three start.Customer support is good. After I returned it they sent the replacement unit quickly.
4,Magnet is not strong enough
3,The adhesive is bad. Doesn‚Äôt even Stick at all.
5,Better than the magnetic ones that I bought
3,Would not stick so I haven‚Äôt used yet. I will try another form of adhesive. Looks sturdy though. Will update later
5,It's strong. It was easy to attach. It's easy to adjust it to just the perfect angle!
5,Fits perfectly where I wanted just a very slight vibration due to the placement but my phone definitely won‚Äôt fall off. I bought a second for my wife car.
5,This is the best car mount by far. The fact that it flexes to fit the curves of my dashboard makes me want to give it 100 stars The magnet is very strong and my phone doesn't go flying off when I make sharp turns or have to brake unexpectedly.Has stayed attached in the triple-digit heat here in California. This fits my 2012 Kia Soul Exclaim.
5,If your car is like mine having a steep dashboard this product will have your problem solved.
5,The description is true to its info I loved this and continue to love it every time I use it. Fully recommended!
5,Adheres well to smooth section of dash nice strong magnet.
5,Good
5,I've tried vent and suction type phone holders but this adhesive holder worked great for my need
5,This thing works so good..had it for a month now and not complaining!!
5,I've had alot of mounts that my phone (Galaxy S10 Plus) just falls right off of. This one however is very sturdy and has a strong magnet. I also like that this one is taller then the ones I've had in the past. I can sit it in both positions with no problem. Definitely recommend and will be buying another one very soon since my son has already tried to get mine an hour after it was delivered.
5,The suction power is awesome holds the phone tightly I'm able to reposition arm to get a better view of my phone. I'd purchased a holder mount from Walmart I don't remember the brand but the adhesive was horrible the weight of my phone was too much for the arm so it would never hold in place it just kept flopping down and around. I'm glad I found this mount it does everything it's supposed to and excels
5,Takes up zero space is totally unobtrusive  and works great. Comes with multiple metal plates to stick to devices and the adhesive works excellent.  I needed to run a second Bluetooth device in my truck to control my wireless brake controller so I got this to mount the spare phone. It takes up so little space that the phone is still there despite not using it for weeks.
3,Love it
5,Very useful and practical
5,I can use my phone case with a built-in magnet with this holder.
5,This is a great product that in my opinion  it performs the more expensive brands. I use it with a specialized phone case that works with MagSafe wireless charging. It is super sturdy and holds my phone without budging. It also blends in with my trucks dark interior F150. I highly recommend this great product.
5,This functioned and operated better than I expected. Tried a few other products similar to this. I am very happy with this one. The magnetism is amazing!
5,It was very easy to install stays stuck well so adhesion is great! Only downfall is the small round plate that you put into your phone to stick to it I guess maybe it's because my phone is heavy it doesn't always say straight it will slide to the left like a windshield wiper
3,After about a week of use you will notice the stand coming off and it only gets worse from there. it needs the 3m double-sided foam not this clear glue.
5,I was having trouble with my other mount coming loose/off on the warm days. This has a larger area for adhesive tape & is staying on much better. The arm makes it easier to position as well.
5,Try to glue it on top of the dashboard and it broke because it didn't glue at all Lmao so was my fault to press so hard or the glue no sticking to it üòÇ product is awsome glue sucks
5,Best phone holder
5,So the backing already comes with adhesive but I used the spare adhesive strip it comes with for a better grip. It's a better magnet than the one I had before and takes a lot less space. So far I'm loving it!
5,Love that its a perfect match for my phone case.
5,Adhesive isn't that strong...had to use my own after I originally used the adhesive that came with it & it only lasted a couple of days in the Las Vegas heat... works great now & battery is strong.
5,After trying two other mounts from a local big box store I found this one on Amazon. It is perfect for my car. Absolutely easy to install adjustable beyond belief with a very strong magnet. I am totally pleased. A perfect mount for my Honda CR-V.
1,It's very annoying because it's very strong mount and it remove my phone metal I didn't recommend this
2,Read the dimensions. It‚Äôs a lot smaller than it looks
1,This didn‚Äôt stick to my dashboard at all I was hoping for the best.  The magnetic ring dud to stick either so sent back
5,Works Excellent and Great Price
1,I‚Äôve bought others from other companies. Those worked for my truck and my dads suv. I bought this one for my moms car. Not really this company‚Äôs fault it‚Äôs more 3M‚Äôs than anything but it has zero glue/adhesion. It came with an extra so after trying with the first one I took it off and put the other one on and that one did not stick either. It won‚Äôt even stick to the mount itself. I tried blow drying it because maybe it was due to the cold but the 3M pads are just duds or something. The other companies used 3M as well. So I feel bad giving this product a bad review because it‚Äôs not really their fault.
1,Within 45 days the stem between mount and magnet broke crashing my iPhone 11 to the floor
2,The plastic won‚Äôt tighten enough to stop vibrations which cause the phone to wiggle and wonder on the magnet
5,I'm a DoorDasher and this product will make my life so much easier when I have to get in and out of the car and take my phone with me.
1,The directions are easy to follow and this was very easy to install. I allowed the allotted time to let the adhesive set but it started coming up just a few days after I installed it. I figured it was due to the hot weather at the time. A few weeks of use and it broke. The magnet and joint seemed strong enough when I was first using it but it didn‚Äôt last long
5,Super easy to use with cell phone case!
1,All of the parts were not included. I was missing the base. I had to return it.
2,I cleaned contact area well. But I could not get it to stick.
5,It was very organized with easy steps to follow. Works amazingly. Very happy with the product
1,Phones slips off when I break or turn a corner
1,When i ordered this item i hoped will help me attached my phone and have my hands free but it's really not working how supposed to work first base not holds and phone all the time going in different directions and finally sticking is off i am totally not recommended.
5,Absolutely spot on! Looking for this kind of magnet mount that fits on my Dodge Challenger car dashboard.
5,works great. i have a larger phone and it held it with no problem. it actually sticks to the dash in my car even in the heat
5,This cell phone mount was very to install it took 5 minutes ad i was so happy I ordered a second one for my wife‚Äôs car.
5,Like this style more than most. It's mounting system makes it easier to move your phone more easily.
5,This phone holder holds up in 110 degree weather. We‚Äôll built.
5,Adhesion was good and mount has good range of adjustment.This was what I was looking for.2021 Hyundai sonata
1,I had to find different things to try and stick it to my dash after a lot of fuss of it not sticking with anything I used I decided to glue it down and it could barely hold up my IPhone XR and it moves ALOT had to get a totally new thing to hold my phone. It‚Äôs not worth the money or time to fool with it
5,has a strong magnet to keep your phone in place. very simple to put together
1,Appears very flimsy comming out of the box.  Magnet not strong enough for my phone.  I don't see the sticky part being very strong either.  I sent it back.
3,good
5,The phone doesn‚Äôt drop quick so the magnet is very strong
2,Tried my best to remove phone from magnet without pulling more sliding and still the metal piece fell off. I have never had one to last.
5,Small size fits great on car dash.
1,No pega nada
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Strong magnet good adhesion I really like its adjustability.
1,Not useful so disappointed!
5,Great productGreat sellers
2,This will not hold an IPhone 12 Pro Max the magnets are too weak. I wouldn‚Äôt even try it with a regular IPhone 12 maybe a mini.
5,Great product easy to install.
2,It doesn‚Äôt work for iPhone 12 Pro which slides down each time I try it. My husband doesn‚Äôt have any privies with his pixel 5 on it.
5,Great product
5,Easy to install
1,It was obvious this product was used before it was shipped to me. The packaging was ripped and the adhesive was stuck to a bag and had all dried up.
1,glue is too weak. buy too early and when try to use it i cannot use it. not recommend to buy.
1,Product will not stick to the dash or anything for that matter won't hold a phone I threw it out the window save your money buy something else
5,Works great!
1,Don't waste your money!Installation easy and looked like it was going to be perfect for the longer reach needed on my dash.Well 2 weeks late the adhesive isn't holding and it fell off. Vehicle isn't out in the sunlight either poorly designed cheap adhesive no where near the level of a Scosche phone holder.Buyer Beware
2,phone shakes and vibrates more than other mounts I've tried
1,Followed included instructions and had almost no stick. Out the money and can't return due to travel. Refund would be great but I doubt it will happen
1,Don't buy
1,Did not stick at all. Tried on textured and smooth surface.
2,The sticky pads aren't the most adhesive on a rough textured dash.
1,The magnet is not strong enough to hold any iPhone.  A big let down because this thing is stuck to my dash.  Now I have to find a way to get it off.  A nightmare!
1,The arm broke after 2 weeks on 2 different ones.
1,Hit a bump ad bye bye. Magnet needs to be upgraded üò§ phone drops too easily while driving.
1,Getting this to stick is almost impossible and it only attaches to smooth perfect surfaces. They don't sell replacement adhesive in this shape so if you blow through the 2 provided then you're just SOL. Skip this and find something that works like a suction cup type.
2,Very cheap looking. Flimsy plastic.
1,Won't stick to dash
1,Garbage doesn't stick
1,Parts did not fit as a part was missing. Flimsy materials too.
1,Doesnt stick at all wasnt able to use it without it falling over
1,This is not sticking anywhere. I wasted my time waiting in this
1,This holder is not good they put rubbish tape its not holding
1,Adhesive could not handle the summer heat. Came back to the adhesive peeling. I‚Äôve had better would not suggest purchasing this one.
1,Worked great for a couple weeks then fell off.
1,Adhesive tape must have been old when i peeled it there wasn't any sticky ness to it
1,Not worth it
1,Stay away. I don‚Äôt recommend this one.
1,Doesn‚Äôt stick
1,Doesn‚Äôt work adhesi√≥n is bad
1,Mi pareja compr√≥ este art√≠culouno para cada una y a los 2 art√≠culos les pas√≥ lo mismo se despegan con los d√≠ascon el peso del cellno sirvees mentira que se pega bien al mueble del carro. Se despega poco a poco hasta caerse totalmente. No gaste su $ en este art√≠culomuy malo.
2,Adhesive is poor it sticks but the glue will pull up about a half centimeter above the dash its not even hot were I live 85 at the most right now. If I still had this in California it wouldn't last the day. Other than the adhesive it works well definitely wanted it to work out will be looking for a replacement.
2,This was pretty much the same as the last 3 large phone holders I‚Äôve had.  They just don‚Äôt stay on in summer heat. Nothing holds them. And I have a smaller phone.
5,I have a 2022 Hyundai Tucson.There‚Äôs no good place to use a magnet mount without it looking tacky.I tried several that were too long or short.  I tried mounting by the usb cord area (inner sides) which worked but sometimes in the way.This way worked perfectly (see photos) and does not block any controls.I highly recommend this strong magnet. Using iPhone XR with otterbox
2,Unless you have the phone in the absolute perfect spot the magnet doesn‚Äôt hold. Introduce a bumpy road or sharp turn and you‚Äôll be kicking it around on the floor board. Bummer bc now it is stuck to my dash
5,I wanted to mount my COBB AccessPort in a different location within my Subaru WRX. This was the only magnetic mount with a flexible base to accommodate the curvature I needed. Build quality is great and I have successfully been using it for a few months now.
5,Simple black color with carbon fiber trim alike strong good plastic material not heavy like another one I own. Because this one is not heavy the adhesive works making it sticks very well. Unlike the heavy one that I own fell few times when it's hot. Good thing I found this to replace my old phone holder.
2,After just a week it started falling off my dashboard.
5,I was very pleased with the quality. It was also very easy to install. I've had it in for over 3 months and it's still as sturdy as the first day. Great purchase!
5,The flexible base was a great feature for I had a curved surface that it had to adhere to.I followed the directions and it worked like a charm.Absolutely no complaints!
4,Perfect shape but the pad is slippery at the magnet.  So the phone tilts with every strong curve I take. Other pads are rubberized not slick for this exact reason.
5,Perfect for scion tc
5,Don't want to go for air mount model. And crv has very less flat surface to hold a mount the flexible design really helped
5,I am going to purchase a second one because it works so good.
5,Es un gran iman! Tiene bastante potencia
5,Awesome tape. Smaller than I thought it would be
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†Good mount. Holds well. Even if it's not completely adhered. I used it right away with no problems but it did get stronger over a few days. Magnet is good. I used 3m tape for my metal piece to the back of my case rather than stuck it inbetween. But that is becuase I'm an Uber driver and don't want it bumping off at any point. Even between the case though would hold well enough for most people.
5,This is a great phone mount very strong magnet and will not fall! I held my phone upside down on it and shook it but the phone didn't fall! I highly recommend
5,THIS REVIEW IS BASED ON MY FIRST PURCHASED OF THIS IPHONE HOLDER I HAD NO PROBLEMS IT ADHERE TO AREA PLACED AT AS TO MY RECENT PURCHASE IT WOULD NOT ADHERE ANY PLACE ON DASHBOARD SLIP RIGHT OFF OR FALL OFF  FIVE STARS BASED ON FIRST PURCHASE
5,Works perfectly in 21 Silverado
5,Su Poder magn√©tico es fuerte
5,The car mount is working great. It was easy to install. It operates very well in many positions.
5,My only issue is I had to move my metal part on the phone on the outside of the case instead of the inside of the phone case.
4,It's supposed to glue down on a curved surface but the top end will always come up. Though it doesn't pull out.It holds my Galaxy Z fold 3 stable.
5,Good durable magnet mount. String magnet but unfortunately my dash board is either to slippery after being sprayed with armorall and I wiped it with alcohol wipes and nothing. Had to return. Recommend smooth surface dash boards almost like plastic style ones
4,I really wanted to this phone mount to work. If your dash hash any slight curve this mount will come undone and fall off your dash. I really do like the phone mount it's just the adhesive that came with the mount really is quite powerful enough to hold it in place especially if there's a curved surface. I did end getting it to work with a very strong adhesive aside from that the phone mount is great.
5,well made just having a bit of an issue with it sticking because I don't have a flat surface. other than that it is great and I so love it for know my phone does go missing in the seat or in the floor. I can have it right there if I need to use it for directions or want to turn on my music it is really nice and well made. Definitely recommend.
3,It has 2 places to move and i dont know if it can handle big phone
5,Fits nicely to the left of the monitor on my 10th Gen Accord LX. The car doesn't have an ideal mounting location so the flexible pad worked out well for me.
5,Worked Great On My GX470. Placed it where I can still keep my hands close to steering wheel and use phone without reaching far and not hitting my knee.Magnet is strong and so is the adhesive!Make sure to clean surface with alcohol well!The little extended arm is a plus to adjust which way you want it!Company sent out a free item after registration of warranty! Great Product!

5,Absolutely love this stand!!! It fits perfect in my 18 Malibu! It‚Äôs not in the way of driving and it‚Äôs sooooo simple to install. I LOVE it!!! The magnets that go on my case / phone are strong as well. I put them on the back of my phone and it works great! 15/10 recommend!
