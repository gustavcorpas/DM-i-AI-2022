5,I saw a lot of different options for toners online some had bad reviews and some cost more but this one seemed to check all the right marks. I was very pleased with what I got with this cartridge. I pulled the tab it said to pull. Installed it in my printer and was able to print good quality prints without any issues. It was worth the price.
5,This is the first time I used this company.  So far so good!  I've only made a dozen or so copies but everything looks good.  Just a tip: When I get a new cartridge I always open up the new one and try it for a day.  That way when my former cartridge runs out of toner I know I have a new one that works with no problems.  So I used it for a day and had no problems--a good sign!
4,When printing on paper is does a great job.  When printing on labels the toner will smear when placing the labels on your finished product.  They will sometimes smear when just removing the label from its backing. They are laser printer labels.EDIT: The company was great to work with.  They offered suggestions on how to fix the problem.  Unfortunately it did not work.  The company offered several options.  I was refunded the full amount.  Thank you for fantastic customer service.
