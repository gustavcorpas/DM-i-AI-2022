5,nothing to dislike about the shipment of product and will be using the laptop a lot for sports and other activities
5,I haven't had this charger long enough to make a statement about its durability. I had this for a week and it seems to be working as it states. I have purhased other chargers from Amazon and they got hot quickly and/or didn'tlast long due to quality. This one hasn't displayed anything poorly. I am optimistic about this one.
5,Great price and on time delivery
5,Needed another cord as my daughter lost my original. Havenâ€™t had any issues with it.
4,fast delivery effective charger.
5,Excellent
5,I ordered this charger because my kid lost his Chromebook charger. It works great!
4,Got this in March to replace my laptop cord that had died here we are 3 months later and this one has now stopped working! Was good while it lasted.
3,Only lasted about 3 months before it stopped charging. Charged fast when it was working.
5,Not much to say; does what it should with no issues. If you need a replacement this is it. ðŸ˜Š
3,This charger didn't even last me three months. I'm going to try to return it. Today it just STOPPED charging. I almost lost critical work. Fortunately I was working in Chrome and Google Docs and all saved automatically. Whew.
5,I made sure to pick out the right charger for my chrome book. It works fine. No issues. Make sure you check for the model number. Couldâ€™ve been a few dollars cheaper but no real complaints.
5,I like that I bought it and now my laptop turns on.
5,It was perfect
5,The cable arrived quickly and worked perfectly. This is my second cable. I was so happy with the first one that I bought a second one to keep for travel.
5,Very pleased that it works with both devices and it's great to have longer cords.

1,I've used this charger for a few hours every other day and tonight it decided to stop working. Less than 3 months after purchasing it. I dont recommend this item.
1,These chargers donâ€™t last. Went to return charger and yesterday was the last day to return. It has only been 1 month. That sucks.
1,I bought 2 chargers and within 5 weeks both are not working anymore. Don't buy from this vendor
1,Unfortunately this charger stopped working about a week after I received it. Very very disappointing. I was worried it wouldn't last long though after opening the box and seeing how cheaply made and light weight it is. Please don't waste your money on this one.
1,These do not seem to last more than a month and I've tried to return one and ups never came by to pick it up.These are very badly made
