5,Though this mouse is not the perfect ergonomic form it is still very comfortable to use. Its lightweight and slim form make it a welcome replacement for my previous bulky travel mouse. The scroll wheel is responsive and the buttons have a great feel when depressing them. It is accurate and paired quickly with my laptop. The best part was the price for this brand new higher-end travel mouse. I might expect to pay $40 for a mouse of this quality which has deterred me from buying one sooner but when I only had to pay 25% of that it makes me want to buy more for when it wears out or I lose it in my travels. The battery hasn't died yet and it will be interesting to see how long it actually lasts.In short I LOVE THIS LITTLE MOUSE!
5,Already set with batteries.... connected quickly.
5,Connected to my surface book go as soon as i turned it on. Works great
5,Love that it Connect via Bluetooth and no Usb dongle is required.
5,
5,Easy to connect and use. I have used it for a week now and no issues.
5,ü§åüèª
4,I use this with my Surface Pro 8 when I need an actual mouse instead of a trackpad. The ergonomics aren‚Äôt great it‚Äôs too flat to be comfortable but the connectivity is excellent and the battery life is good. Makes for a good travel mouse because of the size and weight.
3,I really want to love it but the clicking noise is too loud. Not sure how I feel about it. It connected perfectly and is very smooth. It's just the clicking noise
5,This did the job on my 2013 Mustang GT. I live in a wooded area and the pan under the wiper motor was acting up (spraying fluid randomly turn on). Replaced the more and worked as if it was new. Only little gripe it doesn't come with the rubber washer that sits between the arm and the rotator (if your replacing yours you might want to get one of those while your in there).
4,This compact Bluetooth mouse is perfect for my Surface Pro 2 Go.  It is flat enough to easily fit in the zippered pocket of my carrying case.  I haven't had any issues with the Bluetooth connectivity.  It was simple to pair.  It is responsive from most any surface.  I just wish it was a SILENT mouse.  The "click" is not too distracting.  I am just used to a SILENT mouse with all of my other devices.
5,Got this mouse as a temporary solution before I could figure out how to connect the apple magic touchpad to my PC but fell in love with it and stick to using this Microsoft mouse. I expected it to look and feel cheap that's what you expect of a product at this price point. However it really exceeded my expectations: it feels sturdy and  pleasant to the touch. It came in a nice sturdy little box that really resembled packaging of Apple products. Good job Microsoft!
5,very ergonomic lightweight low profile mouse easy to use.
5,NO Dongle. I have dongles and mice all over my house. None of the dongles sync with any of the mice. Urrrrgh. I bought this mouse because Microsoft is a trusted brand looks fantastic is crazy inexpensive at $17 and... no dongle. No effort at all to sync with my work laptop and absolutely love it. I just bought two more for Surface Pro and my laptop.I looked at options because I wanted visual distinctions for each device. I found nothing that could compete on quality and price.
5,I finally upgraded my mobile mouse (previously had the MS Mouse 4000 that I had for YEARS) and while it was a big change I'm all the better for it. First the Surface mouse is Blue Tooth enabled - no more keeping track of the USB toggle. In terms of connectivity after I hit the button to turn the mouse on there's maybe a few seconds before it's connected to my Surface Pro and I can start using it. I love the scrolling wheel - it is a single metal wheel and no rubbery stuff that could wear off like it did with the 4000. It is also a button for page scrolling up/down/left/right. The casing is very smooth with a matte finish no smudges unless your hand is super sweaty damp or oily. Wipes clean very easily too. To access the batteries it's super easy - just push the magnetized panel up and it slides away. Unlike the 4000 this takes 2 AAA batteries instead of a single AA. The mouse is very light despite those batteries. I also got the Cobalt Blue color to get as close a match to my Surface type cover which is Teal. I would have loved a mouse in Teal!Left and right buttons are clicky in sound doesn't bother me but it may with others. As much as I love the uniform shape and how slim it is especially when I need to pack it while on the go I feel that it is a bit long for my hand and with the absence of the "mouse arch" for support it takes some getting used to for prolong mouse work. I thought about getting the Arc mouse but the reviews were not convincing enough for me. But a slightly crampy hand reminds me that the Surface Pro is also a touch screen and I should utilize both screen and mouse while working. :D If there's anything this mouse is lacking it would be the "Back" button that was on the left side of the 4000 mouse. With such a minimal movement you could navigate so easily. :D It would be awesome if MS could add that to this mouse.
4,I bought this for a couple reasons: the mere fact that using the dongle with a non-BT mouse is inconvenient (it ties up the one USB port) and I wanted something to match my beloved Surface Pro.This mouse is the exact color scheme of my surface. The platinum plastic color is the same the shiny chrome window matches... perfect in that regard. The three buttons give a satisfying click and the wheel works as advertised.It's not like the pen where it just connects and you can turn BT off... you have to keep BT on to use it. Not much of an inconvenience there.The mouse works fine (as in slides and tracks movement) on my rough-surface dining table (for an impromptu setup) and couch fabric (when I make my TV a second screen for Zoom meetings where the mouse is several feet away from the Surface Pro) which in my opinion makes it an 'anywhere' mouse. It also works fine on the black table protector/writing surface/mouse pad that I bought to do my schoolwork on. It doesn't like plain white sheets of paper though which I had previously used with my wired and dongled mice. This is not a con just means I don't have to keep a makeshift mousepad around.What a buyer needs to know is this thing is essentially flat as in not ergonomic. You will not be comfortable if you try to rest your palm on it. This is a great advantage in portability however it is not ergonomic at all. It's a clean flat mouse (think like  wallet sized) that matches your clean little MS Surface and that's all it is. You don't turn it off and on its all automatic. I have only had this thing for a week so I can't speak about battery life quite yet but it does take standard AAA in perhaps the most elegantly designed battery compartment iv'e yet to see.
3,The mouse works great when it works. However it's telling that I own several logitech mice/keyboards and 3 microsoft mice/keyboards and logitech consistently pairs more reliably with my microsoft surface laptop than microsoft's own products do. Logitech is a well-loved great company; microsoft not so much
5,This is birthday gift. This mouse is small flat but offers comfortable grib in hand. Nice design and a perfect companion for surface pro.
5,Best mouse I‚Äôve had. Well thought out.
5,The positive reviews are to be trusted.  This mouse is small comfortable accurate and attractive.  It comes with Duracell batteries (AAA) connects immediately via BT and works perfectly with my Dell Inspiron 2-in-1 laptop.  The color is a clay white but looks fine against the silver laptop.  No problems.
5,It‚Äôs hard to explain the qualities of this without mentioning it‚Äôs far more expensive cousin - the Microsoft Arc Mouse.First of all let me say that this mouse is not going to win any innovation awards.It‚Äôs just a regular Bluetooth mouse with regular right and left clicks and a (satisfying) metallic-looking scroll wheel.I bought this particular one because it matches my Surface book 3 (almost - it‚Äôs a little lighter in color but nothing that would bother me).I also like its ergonomic shape - not bulky not too flat just right.Now if you‚Äôre like me and want the best of the best you may be considering the more innovative Microsoft arc mouse that can be all the way flat for storage or can fold upwards.But after having a frustrating right-click experience with the fancier foldable Microsoft Arc mouse I decided to return it to Best Buy and order this mouse from Amazon instead.The cost of the Arc mouse was never an issue for me but this one is a fraction of the cost and yet far more user-friendly.For the Arc mouse you have to ‚Äúre-train‚Äù your mind about how to right-click (remove all your fingers from the mouse and only click the top right of the mouse).It was really annoying - I just had to downgrade to this guy which I‚Äôm now excited about.Not a big deal but the scroll experience is also better too than the Arc mouse.
3,I'll start by saying this is my favorite bluetooth mouse when it is new and working properly. It rarely disconnects battery life is long and it is comfortable to use all day. However the clicking mechanism has worn out after less than 2 years and it no longer registers every click. I'm sure some wear is to be expected but less than 2 years in unacceptable.
5,not much I can say other than it works great. good size and reasonable priced.
4,for my hands it was very uncofortable
5,I like to keep my desktop cord and clutter free.  This sleek attractive mouse designed for Windows is a perfect compliment to the sleek ultra think bluetooth Windows Keyboard I purchased.
3,Flat and looks and feels premium. Piece of cake to connect to BT. Can only connect to one BT device. Takes two AAA batteries which is comes with.All is what you would expect on a mobile non daily mouse but the fingertip type mouse instead of a palm mouse was uncomfortable to use. If I need to use the mouse on the go for a short period of time I would just use the laptop onboard mouse options. What I was looking for was a mobile mouse that is good for travel with a small footprint but it has to also be comfortable and this flat mouse was causing uncomfortable wrist pain while using. I ended up finding a palm mouse which has a small footprint and comfortable to use.
5,Small size connects easily and the buttons and wheel have a nice feel.
4,If you forget to turn it off it unfortunately doesn't seem to have a power save option.
5,This mouse sits a little more flat than a normal mouse which I really like. It seems to put less stress on my hand/wrist and allows me to rest my hand normally. It's made out of a quality material that feels food and doesn't show fingerprints. I had no issues with connectivity and battery life has been perfect thus far.
4,Happy with my purchase. Been using it for about a month on and off. Battery life seems to be good. Bluetooth was easy and stays connected just fine. The mouse is small but I knew that buying it. I will probably upgrade to a better mouse in the future but this does the job just fine. I wish you could charge the mouse instead of using batteries.
5,works very well with my dell xps and is very comfortable for my hand
3,I currently have a Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Mouse 1560. It's big and heavy and great but it requires a USB adapter and AA batteries the thumbpad upholstery is peeling off and this is 2019. I wanted a GREAT Bluetooth mouse that wasn't the size of a grapefruit when packing for travel; the Apple Mouse II doesn't have a physical scroll-wheel or middle mouse button and I need the middle mouse button a thousand times a day. I include that introduction and the Apple nod because I think Microsoft needs to consider this previous generation of mouse when designing its replacement.This is lightweight and the materials feel a little cheap. And it's pretty affordable so fine but this is also supposedly the flagship mouse for this generation of Microsoft devices. This sounds like a little gripe but the heavier a mouse is the easier it is to be precise and smooth with it. This is important in certain jobs or playing games or whatever prolonged and steady use. Clicking requires a little more force than it should. Same with the middle mouse button / scroll wheel. They don't glide like butter they glunk. Finally and this is a small-yet-perceptible difference: the lag from bluetooth (vs a USB or wired connection) is there. If you do any sort of work that requires tons of tweaks and precise clicks per day you may notice a small drag in your productivity and discomfort in your wrist or hand. There's nothing ergonomic about the mouse and oddly enough it feels bigger than it needs to be.Pairing is easy on a Mac but I've had problems adding this as a Bluetooth Device to both Bootcamped Windows 10 AND a standalone Surface Book 2 the latter of which is unacceptable both being Microsoft products. It also goes to sleep fairly quickly and takes a few seconds to wake up when moving it. This is just kind of annoying in a mouse.SUMUP:This is fine for a cheap mouse but I now have an extra mouse that doesn't work with my Windows devices and isn't as good as my old mouse but is serviceable when I need all USB ports for other uses and when I want to travel light as possible and still have a mouse. Is that worth $35?
5,It does exactly what it says. Sleek and easy to travel with.
5,I was looking for a replacement mouse at my office for my laptop. I have a Microsoft surface. This is a fantastic little mouse and work right out of the box. I highly recommend it
5,LO UTILIZO TODOS LOS DIASES EXCELENTE
3,Weak point!!
3,I recently purchased a new Surface Laptop and with only 1 USB port I had to find a bluetooth mouse to replace my Logitech wireless mouse with USB receiver.  I was drawn to the simplicity and design of the Surface Mouse.  When I received it setup was a breeze.  The laptop knows it's nearby and immediately pairs the mouse.  Once I start using it though the lack of curvature/hump in the mouse was the first thing I didn't like.  It is very flat and something about the ergonomics is just not right.  I have a 27" iMac desktop also and the Magic Mouse that comes with that is also very flat but it feels better (a little more rounded maybe) and more natural maybe because it has no buttons and you can press anywhere to click?  In any case I was hoping the Surface mouse was going to have a similar feel but sadly it does not!I gave it a few more days as well as work on a heavy clicking and heavy right-clicking spreadsheet and that is when I decided the mouse needs to go.  The "action" of the clicking feels forced and my palm started to hurt with the lack of support.  So unfortunately I had to return this Surface mouse and instead purchased the Logitech M720 which is the bluetooth successor to the M705 wireless USB version that I still love.  It is far and away a better mouse than the Surface mouse which is really for looks!  The Surface mouse may work for lightweight usage (like web browsing or document typing) but for anyone who does a lot of of spreadsheet work I feel that it would be very inadequate.
5,Connected easily and comfortable to grip - good quality good price!
3,I recently changed companies and had to switch from Mac to Microsoft products . I am trying to find a mouse equivalent to the Magic Mouse. I liked the look and feel of this mouse but when clicking around it is so loud! Really loud. Had to return it.
4,In looking for a mouse for my Surface Go my criteria were that the mouse have a slim profile (to fit easily in my tablet sleeve) and Bluetooth connectivity (Surface Go has only one USB port). Henceforth thereto hitherto I went with the Microsoft Mobile Mouse.It‚Äôs a pretty simple design: left button right button scrolling wheel and a Bluetooth button that doubles as the power button. The cover for the batteries is easy to remove (it‚Äôs magnetic) but I haven‚Äôt had any issues with it coming off while stored or during use. Nor have I had any issues with Bluetooth connectivity. Relative to other portable mice it‚Äôs flat-ish but still has a curved design.An unexpected bonus for this mouse is that it works well on multiple surfaces. I have had it since March and have only used it on a hard-top surface a couple of times. Most other times I use it on my lap or on a couch pillow.The one downside is that the batteries only lasted about a month. It‚Äôs possible that the power button was pressed while in the tablet sleeve or backpack but it‚Äôs a small button that is pretty much flush with the bottom of the mouse. So I bought rechargeable AAA batteries in case battery life is going to be an issue.
5,Connects fast and battery life is durable
5,The surface mouse has some heft on the bottom of it but it isn't heavy. This comes from the 3 AAA batteries that power the mouse. The weight gives it a sturdy feeling despite how small the mouse is. I have big hands so this mouse is much shorter in length than my index finger and a little shorter than my Logitech G600 gaming mouse. Interestingly enough it feels almost the same weight as the G600.The mouse connected to my Macbook Pro 15" instantly and it wakes from sleep very quickly as well. I had a Corsair Scimitar bluetooth edition that would take *forever* to wake up and wasn't nearly as easy to connect via bluetooth. This is an absolute 5-star rating from me although I would hesitate to recommend this as your main mouse. This is mostly because there aren't any ergonomics. The mouse is nearly flat as a plane and I can see this causing wrist problems with long term use. Still for the price this is a fantastic bluetooth mouse. Probably the best I've ever used.
5,It was easy to connect and easy to use. Works great
4,The product would have gotten 5 stars if not for the batteries issue.  It worked great.  Unfortunately unknowingly to me the batteries that came with the device were ticking time bomb.  Today it stopped working so I went to change the batteries for the first time since receiving this mouse.  When I went to remove the batteries I was shocked to see that one had corroded making the mouse useless.  The mouse was great for the short time it worked.
5,Excelente producto.
3,I bought this as a multipurpose mouse mostly for use with a macbook and iPad on the go not with a Surface so I can't speak for how well it works with it's intended companion device. For a mouse this certainly will serve it purpose. Allows you to move the cursor and scroll pages wirelessly over bluetooth. It also has a very sleek design which I like. The battery door is attached with magnets which is clever and easier to use that the other mice which have small latch releases that you need a fingernail or tool to get at. Other than that nothing else about this mouse is exceptional. I suppose since portability is a factor here the lighter weight could actually be a benefit for someone trying to save every ounce they can but using it feels like you are moving a plastic toy around on the table. The weight distribution is also off center because of the batteries so every time you readjust the mouse the stern end refuses to leave the table at the same time as the bow.  Because of the cheap plastic feel the rest of the mouse falls in line. The clicks are shallow and the scrolling feels strange. I purchased this because of the clean design and low price but paid heavily in ergonomics. This mouse is not made for long sessions of comfortable use. (and my main mouse is the apple magic mouse so I'm not very picky in this area)If you're in a pinch or need a mouse for very short term use here and there and weight is a factor I'd say this is a good mouse for that. If you plan on doing anything more with it than that I'd look elsewhere.
5,This Microsoft mouse is very comfortable and links up quickly with both my PC and Mac.  No special software to buy just turn it on and it syncs up like magic.
5,It takes too much time to do this for every product that I buy. Please restrict to just clicks
5,This mouse is cheap and great
5,nice slick body
5,so. easy. 2. use the. best mouse
5,A great value and sophisticated mouse
5,The mouse is small light easy to operate "friendly" to hold. It is great for traveling.
5,Light sturdy silver matches well with Apple products overall well-balanced and price is amazing
5,Very nice mouse works great right out of the box!
5,I have been very happy with this mouse. It is very ergonomic and easy to use. I highly recommend this mouse
5,My wife has one of those $12-13 dollar bluetooth mice that you can get on here but I decided to splurge a little bit and go with the Surface mouse. My wife's mouse just felt too small for my hands and this mouse looked super sexy in the images.Well it's as nice as it looked! Maybe not QUITE as nice but still a very good looking mouse. I also love the feel of it as it's light but not completely cheap feeling. It has a sort of textured top where you rest your hand which is soft.Another feature I didn't think I'd care about is the scroll wheel! I bought this to go with my Pixelbook because my Apple Magic Mouse didn't work with scrolling on it. I thought I loved my Magic Mouse due to the touch scrolling (no wheel) but as it turns out I really actually missed the scroll wheel! It's so satisfying to be able to feel the clicks and really have fine control.Overall great looking mouse works great and feels great and so far have had zero connection issues or anything. Definitely recommend!
5,Did what I expected.
5,5 star for sure amazing looks amazing everything
3,So I purchased this mouse as a second to use with my work computer. I like the color shape and size. BUT the clicking noise is loud. What's the point of it as it is an irritant to anyone around or to yourself in the quiet hours of the day. Anyway didn't open it right away so I was unable to return.  I'm using it periodically until I purchase a new 'second' one.
5,I recently got my Microsoft Surface laptop and I am not use to a laptop. My fingers are too old and big to try to maneuver on the laptop keyboard so I decided to get the Surface mouse to make it easier for me to use my laptop. It is a lifesaver and a game changer. I love using the mouse and it makes it so much easier to learn my new laptop as well as use it immediately. I highly recommend this Surface Mobile Mouse.
5,The magnetic battery cover on the back is the bomb AND the clicks it makes are satisfying
5,I took this mouse out of the box about 15 minutes ago and already love it. I was using a Magic Trackpad for about 6 months and decided to look for an alternative. The trackpad requires too much pressure to click which got annoying. The Microsoft mouse connected in about 10 seconds out of the box (it comes with 2 AAA batteries). It glides smoothly across both a desk surface as well as the screen (there's no glitchy movement onscreen). It's nice to have a trackwheel again too. It fits my hand well. Last but not least its minimalist design looks like it "goes" with my Macbook Pro even if it's not a sleek Apple product. I'm SO glad I decided to give this mouse a try instead of shelling out for a Magic Mouse (which is a little more than double the price).
5,So I've only had the mouse for a day and I love it. I am currently working from home using my Microsoft Surface laptop. I was using a mouse I got from 5 below several years ago that finally died on me. I decided to order this mouse as a replacement. I didn't have to follow any of the instructions the minute I took out the plastic paper that sits in the battery it lit up and synced to my computer(my bluetooth was enabled already). Works on pretty much all surfaces as i don't use a mouse pad. Mouse is very smooth and a little flatter than traditional mouses. It also devides the mouse buttons so you have the left and right click unlike apple lol. Also it comes with batteries already in it!
5,This is the 3rd mouse like this that I have purchased. They connect and work great. The size is smaller than a normal mouse but not too small. They pack away in a backpack and have never failed me. Everyone in the house that uses one likes them and has no problem with them. They will stand the test of time.
5,Item arrived sealed and in new condition- I was surprised at how light the mice is in relation to its size. It almost felt like a toy but don't let this featherweight pointing device fool you it's a fully functional mouse.- Tracking accuracy is decent. I definitely wouldn't play fast-paced action shooters with this thing. But for productivity its great.- I have yet to test the 'Bluetrack technology' that claims to work on most surfaces as I don't have any glass tabletop so I can't comment on their claims- It's easy to connect just pair it with your Bluetooth enabled PC by long pressing the Bluetooth button (which is also on/off) and it's done.- clicking noise is noticeable but muffled. So it doesn't really bother me.- I don't know how long the battery life will last. I have yet to test that.Overall its a perfect travel mice for your Surface device and complements the cobalt blue keyboard or you can mix and match a combination of colors.
2,After two years or so of intensive use it just stopped working.It's impossible to open it for service without breaking the parts that join the lid.
4,I love the size and ergo of this mouse. Bluetooth connectivity also just works but if you take this mouse anywhere (and I imagine like me many bought this as a travel mouse) it will turn itself on in your bag. They positioned the switch on the underside of the mouse flush. If they'd just recessed it the slightest bit there would be no problem. But as it is if the mouse jostles and the switch hits anything the mouse turns on and batteries start to drain. I'd say the mouse is on about 75% of the time I check my bag. Crazy enough even with that problem battery life is still ok but it's quite annoying to see that little blue laser turned on. Another solution would be for Microsoft to add an inactivity timeout.
4,Beautiful sleek mouse. I've gotten lots of compliments on it. It isn't the most ergonomic because there are mice that are made to fit and support an adult hand perfectly but this mouse works for me. I use it as my travel mouse because it is so thin. Bluetooth is great and I've been able to use it twenty feet away. (I wasn't testing it I just happened to walk off with my laptop.) I like that it uses batteries so that I just have a set of rechargeable batteries in case I need it. Battery lasts for weeks but I like to take the batteries out when I'm not using it since i have my touchpad set up to lock when it is connected. It is a pretty penny for a mouse but I plan to have it for ages.
5,Conectividad bluetooth
5,Great value.
3,My advice: do not buy it.This is my first Bluetooth mouse and it has lagging issues during normal use. I thought it's due to Bluetooth connection not as stable as wireless connection (usb receiver). But I also bought a Logitech Bluetooth mouse which works perfectly without any lag. Will stick with Logitech product in the future.
5,It works
5,This mouse is compact perfectly designed and made with high quality materials. Instead of its small size it is ergonomic and comfortable. I needed a mouse for my Ubuntu laptop which is Lenovo Thinkpad P50 and was little bit dubious if it was going to pair with my machine or not. It paired just a piece of cake less than 5 seconds.Pros:- compact and portable- clicks are neither noisy not sharp gives a nice clicking feeling- middle scrolling button gives a nice tactile feedback- high precision scrolling and moving the cursor is highly precised especially on high resolution 4K monitorsCons:- clicking could be little bit smoother for a new mouse the required force to press the buttons - especially middle button is higher than it is expected for a good mouse.Bottomline:For the price and portability and overall quality I highly recommend this product. Especially if you have a Linux operating system this could be very reliable mouse.
5,I had my eye for a long time on the Microsoft arc mouse but prolonged buying it for my surface. I decided to buy that mouse but before I did I found this one. It has better overall reviews compared to the arc mouse. So I ended up with this one and I have to say I love it! Of course I can't compare the two but this  mouse connected automatically to my surface I didn't have to really do anything. The battery it came with is still going strong! It is slim so it fits into my laptop bag and is easy to carry around with me. It fits well in my hands. There is no lag to the mouse movement. I highly recommend this mouse if you are looking for a Bluetooth connected mouse.
3,I‚Äôm a fan of Logitech mice.  Ok I‚Äôve said it.  I purchased this for one purpose - to use with a surface tablet.  Here‚Äôs the real scoop in a nutshell- this mouse works.  It‚Äôs small.  It takes up little space.  That‚Äôs the positives.  My issue is this - I have large hands.  I also use a mouse a lot - I don‚Äôt just ‚Äúpalm‚Äù the mouse I like to curl my fingers around the mouse - which means I need a larger mouse.  I‚Äôve shared my setup with several others (I use this for work) and the consensus from six other people breaks down to this: two liked the mouse mostly due to small size three were not a fan and would send it back and one person had no particular take.  EVERYONE stated they would not pay the premium for having a Microsoft mouse that had so few features.  I decided to keep it as it‚Äôs part of my work gear and it does save me some space but please believe me do yourself a favor: before purchasing get to your local electronics store and take for a test drive!  If I had I would have passed on this purchase.  But to be fair the mouse works and probably exactly as intended by the manufacturer!
3,Nice shape & quality but Eats batteries & periodically jumps.  Duracell batteries that came with it should have lasted longer.  Only 3 weeks.  The jumping happens at the wrong time sometimes.Update: 3 days later new batteries are down to 6%.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Value is excellent for price. Connected in less than 5 seconds
4,Bought this mouse for annotating research: a lot of highlighting and clicking not focusing on precision just portability and comfort. This mouse has a nice click and scroll feel to it. The size of the mouse itself is good (I have very average-sized hands) but it is flatter than I expected very flat actually and I've had to flatten my grip (I usually curl my fingers a lot more on a mouse). Connection sometimes takes a second to boot up but hasn't disconnected randomly at all. Happy with this purchase.
5,Happy to have found this.... great complement to my Surface Pro....all that is needed and nothing more.  I suggest retaining the cellulose strip provided with shipping to insert with the batteries to preserve their life but otherwise worth every penny.
3,I much prefer the Microsoft Ergonomic wireless mouse which I ordered shortly after getting this one.  I probably could have adjusted to the smaller mouse but I‚Äôm just used to the bigger ones I guess.  Also I found something off about the way the cursor moved.  It dragged a little or something.  Hard to explain exactly but the Ergonomic Mouse I found to be better.
4,UPDATE: I did a system update to my laptop and was able to reconnect the mouse. Giving 4 stars since I had so many issues with both.Not worth the money. This is the second surface mobile mouse in a year and half to die on me. The second on was purchased only 4 months ago. I do like the slim design and Bluetooth capability but it‚Äôs just not worth the price to keep replacing it.
4,Paired to: Microsoft Surface Pro 7The mouse is beautiful has a nice tactile click love the middle click button and pairing is easy.  It matches my keyboard which is the genuine maroon Microsoft Signature Type Cover of the same generation.  I'm only removing a star because the mouse frequently has to be repaired (seen as paired but not connected).  2 clicks of a button and it's re-paired with the Surface Pro 7.
5,I've used Logitech mouses for the past 3 years at Uni and have loved them but I fell in love with the minimalist style of this Microsoft mouse and had to see how it compared. I've used it for a few days now and have been satisfied with how much more comfortable my wrist and hand are when scrolling and positioning as compared to my former Logitech M325 mouse. It does take some time to get used to though since it is way more flat than the typical Logitech. It is a bit more expensive than other quality mouses and yet it is worth the purchase in my opinion. Steve Jobs wouldn't be to happy that I'm using a Microsoft mouse with a MacBook XD
5,Very portable size which fits well in my hand. Good sensitivity and exvellent battery life.  Only caution I have is to be careful not to let it drop on a hard surface. My previous (same model) mouse lost the magnetism of battery door to latch so it wouldn't latch magnetically after the hard jolt. No other complaints. Great for traveling. Push the button on the bottom to turn off the track light for longer battery life.
4,I've used the mouse exclusively over the past month. It's a decent product. It has a pleasant feel to it the scroll is precise and clicky. The bluetooth doesn't always connect right away but that could be the laptop and not the device. I think it works best as a traveler and not an "all the time" kind of mouse. I notice I have some pain in my pointer finger because the mouse is not ergonomic. It's too slim to be ergonomic. I plan on going back to something a little more substantial and leave this in the bag for when I'm out.
5,I have had this mouse for a couple of weeks and I am really liking the little thing.  I don't use it all the time just for a little bit with my Surface after work but I'm not spending any serious time with it or using it for work.  So I like that it is small and thin and doesn't require a separate little usb connector that my previous wireless mice (?) have required.  The slim design and bluetooth connectivity make it very portable.  I haven't had to worry about the battery since I started using it.  I don't think it's the most ergonomically correct design but since I'm not using it for prolonged periods of time I'm not really too worried about it.
2,The color of the mouse is not the same as expected from the website. When I received the product it was not silver but looked white and cheap making. I am not pleased with it and if I return it I believe I would be charged a restocking fee and I kept it so I don't have to go to all that trouble. However it was connected fine.
5,Bought it for my Surface laptop Go. Easy to connect. It missed the first time but redid it and it connected. Feels great under my palm no stress on my wrist. Very responsive I don't even use a mouse pad even tried moving it over my pant leg and it worked
5,This mouse is in line with the apple magic mouse minus recharge-ability. It  sync via bluetooth perfectly swiftly with a surface device but works just as well with over devices. It seems to tout  bluetooth LE (low energy).  I've used religiously daily for about 6 mos and the battery remains at 100%.  All this using the two "OG" AAA's--energizer. There are 5 buttons Left right scroll scroll press & sync button which needs to be held for a couple of seconds to sync. Also to turn the mouse off a single sync button press is needed.  Clicking is slighted muted and isn't as obnoxious as others that surround me. I've personally recommend Logi's M2 which I use at home but this by far is my favorite travel mouse.
5,I needed a new mouse because my previous one had crashed to the floor (or dirt or concrete) one too many times and was getting weird. This mouse is very small and light and easy to fit into a travel bag. It works very well and seems to be made very well. The Bluetooth connection was quick and easy to set up and the mouse reconnects very quickly when I turn my laptop on. I gave only 4 stars to the battery life because I don't really know -- I haven't had the mouse long enough. I use it daily when I'm traveling but it might sit turned off for 2 weeks in my bag between trips so I expect the battery life to be fairly long.
5,A very charming and accurate mouse. The "triangular" one that I bought with my original surface performed so poorly (although its design was nice) that I rarely used it. This one is easy on the wrists.I read the other view about batteries and just turn off the blue light with the button underneath before putting it away. I've only had it a few days so I presume the battery life will be ok by switching off the Bluetooth. When I turn it back on it syncs with the Surface Book instantly. The slim design allows it to easily fit in the pouch of my surface carrier.
5,Works great no issues. Love the sleek look and feel.
4,I choose to get this mouse because of its portability and I think for a backup mouse you can bring anywhere it serves it's purpose really well. The BlueTooth connection was finicky to set up at first with my surface pro 6 but after I updated the drivers and set up the connection the pairing was almost instant every time I turn it on. The battery life is amazing if you use good quality batteries and turn the mouse off every time you don't use it it has lasted me almost a month. The ergonomics leaves a little to be desired but that's a trade-off for its portable design.
2,After a year left click will stat to miss clicks and at other times double clicks.I googled the problem for this mouse and others have also reported this on microsoft forums but I haven't seen any fix for it.
4,I bought this mouse even though I am not using a surface because it is very pretty really love the burgundy color.The mouse connected to my computer really quickly and works fine no lags or anything. The look and the size of this mouse is perfect for me. The things I dislike is the feel of the click and the sound of it (a little bit loud) which are pretty much the most important thing you ask for when you buy a mouse. But overall it is a good product and my feel may be personal. I am happy to keep it because a Bluetooth mouse helps save a USB port.
3,I purchased a Surface Mouse a couple years ago and that mouse seemed like a reasonable low to mid range range mouse at a reasonable price and it's been working just fine for the last two years. The magnetically-attached  battery cover is a nice feature. Overall nothing overly great and nothing too terrible.I needed another mouse for a different computer so I purchased another Surface Mouse in Feb. 2021. It *seems* like the new one is slightly different. The external materials feel a little cheaper or thinner. I'm wondering is Microsoft changed material vendors to reduce production costs.The new mouse was sold by Amazon not a third party vendor. Without any real checking by me this new mouse doesn't seem to be counterfeit.
4,Easy to setup but there‚Äôs a delay when the computer wakes up. I am using with a surface pro 6.
5,I have to use both Apple and Microsoft products at the same time at work so I can confirm that the two mice won't explode if they're near each other. On a serious note this mouse is as comfortable as some of my more expensive ASUS ROG gaming mice. Very happy with this purchase and will more than likely get another. Great feedback from button presses and smooth scroll wheel action. Great buy!!!
4,Honestly it looked great probably excellent for portable use but it didn‚Äôt feel comfortable for every day use. Maybe it‚Äôs the way I like to hold a mouse in general but I do have small hands size 6. You can‚Äôt palm the mouse because of the low profile. And my fingers start to feel irritated by edges of the mouse when you have to hold it. Had to return it.
5,These OEM devices don't last but 3 years and a new one is needed. Otherwise it connects in a snap and works like the original.
4,It‚Äôs a solid little product connects with ease and tracks well. My only gripe is it‚Äôs a little slim for my hands which are on the medium/large side. It‚Äôs perfectly usable would just be a little more comfortable for me if it were slightly taller across the middle hence the 4*.Good product by Microsoft though!
5,I purchased this for my Surface tablet and it was extremely easy to hook up and has been working great. The slim feel and design makes it easy to slide into the tablet cover I purchased. Great buy especially for the price. I would purchase again and recommend to others.
5,This mouse is reliable comfortable and I think it's a great value. It's always quick to connect and tracks precisely even on my plain desktop surface (no mouse pad). I love that it takes standard AAA batteries (I use it all day and haven't changed them for months) and has a very easy-to-remove magnetic door for when I do eventually change the cells. The standard Bluetooth connectivity means that I don't hog a USB port on my tiny laptop and can just focus on using the mouse not messing with drivers or software or frills. If you just want to get work done and not worry about extra buttons features you won't use or bulky sculptured bubble mice bodies this flat little wonder will serve you really well.
5,I purchased this mouse to use with my desktop and was initially concerned that its small size and slightly unconventional shape was going to be a issue.  However in short order I adapted to its size and shape and consider it be an excellent purchase and would have no hesitation in recommending and have done so.
5,I bought this mouse to use with my ipad when I travel as I hate having to bring my laptop and potentially break it. The bluetooth works great and it feels good in my hand. So far the battery life has been good. The slim profile is also nice as it fits into my backpack easily.I probably wouldn't use it as my primary mouse but for a secondary one you can't go wrong.
4,The Bluetooth is seamless with a surface pro one pair and it connects lighting fast not very ergonomic very thin and easy to fit in a briefcase or even pocket. I didn't need to replace the battery for about 18 months this is my second surface mobile mouse (i replaced the first one because after a year the right click button started to squeak) its cheap to replace and i highly recommend for surface users.
5,I found this mouse exceptionally efficient reliable and durable. It survived several accidental drops from my desk. I liked it so much I bought a back-up mouse.
5,Microsoft definitely learned from Apple.  This mouse looks terrific could be connected to my old Surface Book in ten seconds and works just fine.  Not quite as high a rest for the palm as my old Arc foldable mouse but that finally stopped bending and I couldn't spend $80 again.  The $30 price for this was right.  And I ordered it on Wednesday evening and it was delivered on Thursday
5,I wanted to replace my existing mouse which doesn't have a scroll wheel for one that has a dedicated scroll wheel. I make too many mistakes if the top surface of the mouse is just a touch pad. I also wanted a low profile/slim design for travel. This mouse fit the bill. Easy to use. Simple left and right click and programmable scroll wheel that is also clickable. Plus the battery compartment cover is brilliant! Just press down on the back of the cover and the front of the cover pops up and then you just pull it gently off.Great mouse. Long battery life so far. Great for travel.
5,It does what it says it will do. It connects immediately to my Huawei Matebook x Pro running Ubuntu 18.04. Sometimes I will have to press the BT button on the bottom of the mouse every now and then to reconnect if it doesn't do it automatically. Beautiful simple high-end design and feel. It is nice and light and the click is firm enough so you aren't constantly pressing it by accident when resting your fingers on it yet easy enough to click so you aren't straining your fingers after a couple hours of use. The middle button-click is firm and the scroll is very precise. I have gone through too many mice in the past couple months but I am definitely keeping this one.
4,I was so thrilled to get this item to connect with my Microsoft Go-2 at such a great price. But it stopped working within weeks and I could not get it to reconnect with Bluetooth no matter what I tried. Barely had it 2 weeks so I returned it.
5,We love this little mouse. We got it for the MS Surface but my husband uses it with his new little laptop and I use it with my Surface occasionally too. A great BT mouse to have on hand. Easy to power off between uses to save battery.
5,works on any surface.
5,I love this mouse. It works perfectly. It is simple. It looks great. The hardware wheel doesn't do weird things. It just works. Like a mouse is supposed to. And no cables to clutter up or get in the way. This is exactly what I was looking for.I use my surface tablet more like a desktop so I'm not taking this around or anything.I had the surface wedge mouse which is pretty neat but freaks out and scrolls on accident quite frequently (it is gesture controlled). Which is weird because the wedge mouse was surface device but drove me nuts.
4,This is a great streamlined mouse that is easy to use. My sole complaints are 1) the battery life but I have yet to find a wireless mouse that doesn't eat batteries so I guess this one isn't any better or worse than others. And 2) the connection falters almost every other time I use my computer (not while using the mouse but when I turn on the computer the mouse isn't discoverable so I have to reset the connection) and that's kind of annoying. Overall though it's a good mouse.
4,I can't quite give it five stars because it's just not quite as comfortable as a more traditional mouse and because my left is a little too shallow so the tactile feel takes some getting used to. You get used to it and you can definitely get by with it though and it's excellent for travel. It easily slips into a little pocket in my tech organizer bag which is normally meant for storing slim battery packs and external hard drives. The Bluetooth connection is really good too. I never have to mess with my computer (lenovo) settings to make it work. If you need a slim travel friendly mouse this is a good buy.
5,So far so good.  Easy to connect...nice and compact for my briefcase...great value!
5,If you have a microsoft laptop dont buy some off brand mouse get this one laptop looks good and mouse fits it/together they look real good you might spend a little more but its worth it connects right away had this for like 5 months and battery still going. Buy this one.
4,Wish it paired with other devices rather than having to disconnect from each device to use on another but I suppose that it's where the capabilities of technology for this mouse is. Maybe another does not sure. would rather be able to work on both surfaces at the same time using one mouse. This mouse is accurate and feels comfortable in the palm
5,This mouse is small but as someone who has smaller hands I find it very comfortable to use. Due to its flat size it's best for those who want their hands flatter and closer to the table; basically those who move their mouse with their wrist as opposed to their shoulders. The size and shape are perfect for tucking it away for travel. The scroll wheel is a plus but it only scrolls vertically not side-to-side -- a minor issue when using digital design programs like Photoshop or Illustrator. Also despite it being a Microsoft product it's Apple compatible (tested using the Macbook 2018).
4,This is a kind of mouse that some people will either love or either hate. From my experience I feel like the shape is decent with some slight awkwardness when holding the mouse. The Bluetooth connectivity is very responsive and one of the best that I have personally experienced. The response time is brilliant with no lag at all. The batteries that are used in this mouse work really well and last for long periods of time. The mouse is very simplistic and easy to use for the average consumer.
5,This purchase was the perfect addition to my Surface Pro 4! I have case with a keyboard though with Covid -19 and having to utilize my laptop on the regular. This help me convert my tablet into a good PC set up. No problems with connectivity nor batter life. FYI the little Bluetooth button on the underside is a standby button. The directions don‚Äôt mention this feature.
5,I travel with my Surface Pro quite a bit and I'm really glad I purchased the Microsoft mobile mouse.  It's way more travel friendly than the arc mouse is really responsive and comfortable to use.  You won't find the AAAA batteries in mega packs at Costco but they aren't too expensive on Amazon.  The only issue I've identified is with all the travelling I do drop the mouse a fair bit.  When the mouse is dropped the magnetic battery cover will pop open and the batteries will go flying. I know I know being more careful with the mouse is the obvious solution but it's sometimes hard to implement when gravity is doing its thing.  Again just an issue not a significant negative.
4,very hard to get connected to my computer. I requested to return it and thought I would try one last time....what do you know....it worked. Wouldn't you know. I have no idea what I did differently.
3,The mouse itself is a very well built and solid mouse. There are no real signs of low quality build throughout. The clicks are responsive and the mouse works on a variety of surfaces. The sizing is compact which makes for a fantastic travel companion.Some pros:-Bluetooth connectivity requires no dongle-works on many surfaces-battery life is solid-good integration with the surface ecosystem-good for the minimal aestheticDespite all that there are too many flaws that sacrifice true functionality over other mice.Some flaws are:-lack of back/forward buttons-scroll wheel seems a bit off when scrolling-form over function-poor ergonomics for long term use (too flat)-quite expensive for a mouseThe competition offers better functionality over what the surface mouse offers. It‚Äôs a solid mouse to have in a pinch or save space but the small amount of space that saved still would be better spent on a more functional mouse.
5,Mouse is comfortable & easy to use.  It would be even better if it wasn't bulky.
2,This is a great mouse which I bought for my iMac with boot camp windows 10. I switch between windows and Mac but unfortunately it will not reconnect between operating systems on the same computer. You must delete and repair each time you switch from Mac to windows and vice versa.
5,The fact that it will connect to the Surface WITHOUT a dongle is awesome. I hate the touch pads that are on the type cover and most laptops today. And I hated that every other time I have had a wireless mouse it occupied a USB port. I never understood why you need a dongle when every laptop has Bluetooth already use it!!!
5,My microsoft designer mouse broke and replacement designer mice was so expensive. I guess this was the upgraded version of the designer mouse but I am not sure. This one though works just as well as the designer mouse. Other than the color and model I am not sure what the difference is between this and the designer mouse. Battery life is also great and bluetooth connectivity is very reliable as well. It is also small enough too so you can travel around with itOverall a very good wireless mouse!.
5,I opened the box turned it on and my surface paired seamlessly.  Very pleased.  It is not exactly ergonomic but then neither is the Surface.  It works flawlessless. I cannot speak to battery life since I just got it yesterday  At this point though I would highly recommend.
3,I ordered the silver mouse to go with my silver Surface Pro 6 that I'm using to work from home. The color is more of a matte grey than silver so don't expect a color match to your device.  Bluetooth connectivity is quick once paired (no delay after switching the mouse on) which is a big plus. The mouse is low-profile which is good for travel but the flatness caused my wrist to cramp after <1 hour of use so a wrist rest if a must if you have larger hands.Overall it serves the purpose and my employer reimbursed me but there probably are better mice out there--like my c. 2010 Microsoft Bluetooth laser mouse that I still use for my main home setup.
5,Very good mouse connects with the surface pro immediately when powered on.The only issue is that it‚Äôs not really comfortable for long hours usage because of it flat design as the palm is mostly suspended and not in full contact with the top of the mouse.
5,It's stylish and coordinates with my other Surface-branded products. The low-profile design makes it easy to take with me. I can just slip it in a pocket when I'm going to a meeting. The construction is solid and feels premium. Even the click wheel has a nicely weighted feel. The magnetic battery cover holds well and I've never had an issue with it falling off. I do wish it had the multi-device connection support of the larger Surface Precision mouse.
5,Great comfortable long lasting mouse
4,Slim works well on a variety of surfaces and is dependable.  Good build quality and it feels like a product that will last a long time.  My only complaint is that the mouse doesn't have a method to turn it off other than removing the batteries.  When tossed in the bag with the laptop it constantly wakes the computer.That aside I love the bluetooth connection and freedom from the dreaded mouse dongle.  Great product.
5,I used to rave about how well Apple products were made in the 1990's but here we are nearing 2020 and it's the Microsoft accessories that are getting the high tier treatment.  The packaging was pristine and the size is perfect for medium to small hands.  The plastic stays clean similar to the Razor mice a far cry from the days of using a strange foaming ammonia product to keep white mice clean as it is not an issue anymore.
5,I would highly recommend this for anyone who takes their mouse with them every where they go. It fits nicely in your pocket and it works on virtually any surface. It might be a little small for someone with large hands but it works great for me. I have used it for graphic design purposes and I‚Äôve found it to be very accurate. Overall great product for a fair price.
5,I've used this mouse for just a couple of weeks but I'm impressed. The Bluetooth pairing is quick and works perfectly. It connects instantly when you turn on the mouse and stays connected during use. Second the tracking is precise and smooth and the scroll wheel has a quality feel to it. The mouse is fairly well built but it is NOT made of metal despite the appearance of being so. Hopefully it holds up well over time. The size is also perfect for stuffing in a small pocket of my laptop bag or backpack. Very nice job on this one Microsoft!
5,This mouse is superb for Microsoft Computers.  My Microsoft Power Book was acting peculiar with a well known mouse product. Switched to  Microsoft and all of the peculiar aspects disappeared.
4,It's a bit small (flat) for any have but nothing I can't work with. Great build quality and battery life so far.
2,After one week start dropping the Bluetooth connection and after 2 weeks finally stopped working I am returning it to replace with Logitech M187 I hope this will work for me for a long time.
4,It is okay and works fine. I bought it cuz it looks nice.However it keeps disconnecting and you have to reconnect it once every hour which gets annoying. How do I fix this? Thanka
4,This mouse seems to work OK. I've only had it for a day so I'm not really able to comment on its battery life. It paired and connected quickly to my surface Pro much more quickly than other Bluetooth devices. Operation is smooth and feels good in the hand.
5,Bought this as a replacement for the surface mouse that snaps flat.  I'd been through two of those they short out and quit working after less than a year.  I'm hoping this one lasts longer since there's no bending and snapping.  Took a few days to get used to using a "regular " mouse again but it wasn't a bad adjustment.  Lays pretty flat so it's still more portable than a traditional mouse.  Time will tell if it is more durable.
3,I'm not very pleased with this mouse. I ordered it about 6 months ago because I wanted something small but I didn't really think about the bluetooth connectivity element. I'm not sure if this is a general issue with all bluetooth mice but this one frequently stalls and then I have to kind of shake it to get it to register again.... this slows down my productivity and defeats the purpose of having a separate mouse! I ultimately gave up and ordered a different product.
4,This is a nice mouse to go with my Surface Pro though it's doesn't fit to your hand as nicely as other mice but it's still a nice mouse for this purpose.
5,Likes - it's ergonomics are flawless for such a small mouse.  Being thin like that it fits in a pocket easily without crowding out your phone or keys like a normal mouse.  It doesn't seem to ever switch off but if the battery holds up that's just one less thing to trip over in your workflow.  Microsoft has taken a while to get the Surface mouse right but I  think they really nailed it with this one.
5,This is a great mouse it connects immediately to Bluetooth and as soon as you push the power button located on the bottom it connects before you can even flip the mouse back right side up. It‚Äôs Worth money however I do wish it was aluminum instead of plastic
2,It's the rectangular gray one in the photo. Compared to the Logitech M187 mini mouse (at the top of the photo)it's a little less high - apx 1/4 inch - but otherwise a lot bigger. The M187 is $12.99 at Staples Best Buy and Office Depot; the MS Surface Mobile Mouse was 33.99 when I bought it here at Amazon recently.Most of my mice have been Logitech and I have had trouble with quite a few of them. This time when I was having Logitech trouble I was determined to buy another brand. This surface mouse got a very good review (PC Mag I think) and wasn't too spendy so I bought it. Often maybe mostly it does not work.  I've used three different sets of batteries each cell tested with a decent voltmeter. Maybe it's Bluetooth trouble maybe it's not; I don't care. Tonight it's working. So is the Logitech 187 which feels much better in my hand and costs a lot less.
5,Buy these types all the time. Great price for the item and usually will last about a year and sometimes more before needing to replace with constant use.
4,buttons are a bit stiff otherwise a solid mouse. It's for easy carry so don't expect comfort and certainly does not have as many functions as the more expensive ergonomic mice and gaming mice. Even though it looks good but I feel it's a bit  overpriced.
5,What I like about this mouse is the soft touch and it takes a light press for it to work. I had a curved collapsible mouse but it was so difficult to click it became a distraction when working. This mouse is quiet and light to the touch.
5,Works great with my work notebook great connection and very light. I'm a management consultant and was very reluctant to buy a mouse as I try to use short cuts for everything I tried several products but most are bulky and heavy. I've been using this product for over a month now it's great and is beautifully (minimally) designed. It fits my Tumi back pack great... Very recommended.
4,This mouse is small (not too small though for a girl) so it is convenient to put in a bag. The design is sleek. However its connectivity is on and off. I will have to use the touchpad instead from time to time.
1,The mouse was completely non-functional by July 2021. At that time Microsoft quickly and efficiently replaced it for me with the helpful feature that I could send the non-functioning mouse back after I received the new one. Now the replacement is functioning poorly. This time Microsoft's policy (after an hour plus on their support chat with three different people) is that they can provide a free replacement but I have to wait for them to send me a shipping label then wait 6-8 business days to receive the new mouse.  This is entirely unhelpful because I can't use the computer without a mouse for a week.  If I have to buy a mouse to use in the interim I might as well just go buy a new non-Microsoft mouse and forget about the replacement.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†very good product perfect for the Sure face Go 2 it works very well and the order arrived on time
5,A tad pricy but I had a cheap version crap out on me quickly and learned my lesson. Wish I'd just bought this one to begin with.
4,Pros: Clean design works well tracks without skips connects easily and stays connected to computer batteries easily accessible.Cons: Simple and generic Scroll only goes up and down does not have page forward/backward feature.  You are paying for a cool looking mouse.
5,Had wireless mouse which tracked horribly on any surface. This is the opposite‚Äîtracks great on any surface I‚Äôve tried. Highly recommend.
4,ProsGood fast pairingGood battery lifeConsResponse not as good as a standard wireless mouse with usb receiverNot convenient to handle.. prefer a bigger curve rather than flat
3,I bought two of these mice for our several computers and after a year I have to say I really don't like them. Buttons are stiff and noisy and I don't care for the way it fills (actually it doesn't) my hand. Ergonomically they really don't work for me. Bluetooth connectivity is OK but that's true of just about every BT device out there--it's established stable technology but it's not enough to make me like this mouse.
4,A good product connects without a dongle directly to your compatible bluetooth equipment; battery lasts ages and is small and portable fots anywhere in your backpack or briefcase. I think is a little small for my hands a female coworker bought the same one and she said it fits her hand perfectly.
5,We have several Surface Gos that we use in the office and people wanted a mouse even though it has a touchpad and a touchscreen. There paired in just seconds and have great batteries. They also work on a lot of actual surfaces (like glass wood metal cushions) and we haven't had any complaints from the staff.
4,It connects effortlessly and works fine.  It even works on "iffy" surfaces.  So far I'm entirely satisfied.  My only reservation is that it's described as "silver" but it's really a fairly matte gray.
5,Works great out of the box. Rated battery life is 12 months and it's sleek minimalist design language makes it go well with my macbook pro or ipad pro. 5/5 will buy again
5,Purchased to use withthe Surface Pro as an alternative to the stylus. Woks good and is small enough to be as mobile as the surface pro.
5,I love this mouse for my Surface Go2! It connects instantly and is so easy to use. It's very accurate and not too sensitive or jumpy. The battery lasts a really long time and I'm really happy with it. I have no negatives!
5,I've been using the MS curve for years.  This is a much lower priced alternative.  It is small and smooth and has worked flawlessly.  Pull it out and it's already connected and ready to go.  Best of all you can easily stow this out of the way in your PC case or backpack or even slip it into a pocket with no problem.
5,for a portable mouse it does its job.. easily connected light it doesn't lose connection . its not comfortable for a long time use and very basic  but for a portable mouse i would except.
5,It's simple it's has a suprisingly smooth scrolling for a traditional wheel.  And I've been using it for 3+ months already and the battery hasn't died yet so I guess energy usage is optimal as well.
3,I loved this mouse for a year then it stopped working correctly. The size and weight were just what I was hoping for and are perfect for travel. However after using this every day for a year the left click button stopped working appropriately and needed to be clicked multiple times in order to recognize it needed to react. I‚Äôve tried several different settings and different computers but it does not fix the issue. I purchased this because I have a surface laptop but I guess it‚Äôs time for a new one. I will not be buying the same one since it stopped working.
1,mice are normally like vacuum cleaners - last forever - the first one bought was replaced in two months and the replacement died in two years
5,Works really well I was skeptical at first but pleasantly surprised.
5,Man the batteries on this little guy dont give up! I've accidentally left it on four or five times now and i would expect after being on for multiple days that it would be dead but its still going!Very responsive bluetooth is strong and doesnt skip around. This is a good little mouse!
5,This mouse connected easily to a Lenovo laptop and runs with no studders or skips unlike several BT mice from Logitech tried on this computer. It works as well as any cordless mouse with a dedicated receiver and it works fine even when multiple other devices are using the laptop's bluetooth for audio keyboard and networking. I've been running it for a couple of months 8+ hours a day on the same battery.
3,I've been using this mouse for several weeks and the included batteries still haven't run out of charge. However this is not a comfortable mouse. It's hard to rest your wrist on it and keep your fingertips on the mouse buttons if you have long fingers. You could rest your wrist by awkwardly laying your hand flat on the mouse and resting your weight on it or having a weird claw grip on the mouse. At least it has a slim and compact profile. I'm also beginning to have bluetooth connectivity issues with my Macbook Pro Retina 13" 2013 model but that may be due to an out-of-date operating system so take that with a grain of salt. It used to connect almost instantly as soon as I wiggled it around.
3,The good- its is light and small so easy to transport. The bad- it tends to be fragile and break. The ugly-the Bluetooth connect sometimes disconnects and you have to reconnect it. Use a padded carry bag.
5,Excelente art√≠culo! Perfecto y listo para utilizar. La surface hace el reconocimiento autom√°ticamente. El agarre ergonomico asiste a uso continuo sin cansar la palma de la mano. Bot√≥n de encendido pr√°ctico u en excelente ubicaci√≥n. Excelente inversi√≥n!
5,I am fairly picky about mice and love them to have some heft to them.  While this is still a bit on the light side it is the best I've found to rival my Apple Magic Mouse 2 that I love using with my MacBook.  Worth the money in my book.
3,I really like this mouse but after having it for only about a year it developed a crack acrossed the top. It's a $30 mouse so I would have not expected that.
5,So small and easy to use. Smooth and fits my small hand comfortably. Easy to pack for trips too because of it‚Äôs sleek shape.
5,bought this to go with the surface.  Doesn't fit too well in my hand but my 1st graders hand is a good size.  He uses it everyday in class
4,Works fine
5,I have another dongle type mouse that was occasionally hanging up/glitching. This blue tooth mouse doesn't have that problem at all. It is very smooth and responsive. The flat-ish shape is nice for traveling but it takes a while to get used to it after using a fatter/rounder mouse.
5,The best mouse for use with a Surface Pro. Pairs effortlessly and the build quality and materials of the mouse feel very nice. Feedback from the mouse to the surface pro is perfect and unlike other optical mice I‚Äôve used in the past this one works on a glass desk.
4,not the best in the industry; but not a bad option if you are using PC
5,This is the plain Microsoft mouse I purchased it to use for my everyday travel work. I don't like using the touch screen on my Surface Pro so much easier for me to use the mouse.There is no on/off switch so I just take the batteries out when not using the mouse.
4,It freezes occasionally.  You have to turn it off and then back on.  I still like it because you do not need to use a usb plug.
5,Connection was so fast and simple.  Mouse works like a charm.  I like the way it fits in my hand and the design makes it great for travel.  Fits in my Surface Go travel bag without a problem and it is not bulky in the bag.  I recommend this mouse for all Surface users.
3,- Exactly two years in and the buttons no longer work.- Mouse disconnects itself every hour or so for 2-3 seconds - long enough to die in the game you're playing.I'd give it 2 stars... but that design... daaaymn
2,The scroll button is hard to press and caused me significant pain for longer than 2 weeks.
5,Great shape and size.  The only problem I have is having to move the mouse to activate the Bluetooth connection with screen.  I guess it goes into sleep mode.  However  don‚Äôt use mouse pad.  Mobile mouse can be placed on anything.
4,Connects pretty easy. The Microsoft mouse and keyboard center is a great addition to this mouse. You can toggle everything from dpi to special macros. The magnetic cover is a really nice touch. It looks and feels premium.
5,This is a perfect mouse to use with my Microsoft surface. Bluetooth connectivity was flawless.
4,The mouse works perfect I love it I use it everyday I don't know if the battery is as good as it says but it hasn't died on me yet but I feel like it gets really low sometimes. The material the mouse is made of isn't top notch but it definitely goes with your surface device.
4,Easy to work
5,Got this to go with my Microsoft Surface and it works well. My BF has the same one and after seeing him use it well and without problem I purchased as well.
5,A cheaper alternative to the newer Surface Mouse. Does what I need it to do - no complaints so far! If I were to criticize it for anything it is that the scroll wheel only works for vertical scrolling but I am not really complaining much on that front.
3,I love the color choices available. I used this product to accessorize my Surface Pro 7 which has a burgundy type cover. The burgundy stylus pen was also available and I purchased it as well. Very pleased that my colors were available.
5,Got it to give as a gift. He likes it. It works.
5,Works well stays connected and the wheel is great.
5,Great looking and a great mouse very smooth easy to pair and overall a great purchase however i will update this review if i see any issue in the coming days
5,I have been using this mouse since quarantine and like the size and compatibility with my Surface.  Easy to set up and use.
5,This mouse and the combination with my surface is perfect. the mouse does  smoothly and effectively what a mouse is supposed to do.  it does not take up much space which compliments the surface which takes up very little space itself.
5,Great ergonomics. Pleasing to use. Very portable. Great battery life.  Works on all surfaces tried. Bluetooth frees up USB ports for other uses. Scroll wheel is very pleasant to use.  For large hand size users I got the full size version.
5,This mouse has an amazing Bluetooth connectivity with my tablet! It isn't a gaming mouse or anything of that sort but a useful mouse that can boost your work productivity. This mouse and a good Bluetooth keyboard is the best combo ever.
5,Fantastic shipping time and super easy to use. Battery still hasn‚Äôt dropped below 100% after 2 weeks
5,Everything about this mouse works flawlessly. There is only one down side and that is the design. I have big hands and the mouse doesn't have much of an arch for my palm. It only becomes uncomfortable after extended uses. Its purpose is to be a compact mouse so I'm not letting that bring down the rating of the mouse. Its still a great mouse!
4,the mouse has great feel to it. it has greats clicks sounds.my only problem is that it keeps turn on in by bag.
5,It is slim fits my hand nicely and easy to use.  It connected to Bluetooth with ease. I just received it so not sure on battery life. I recommend it and would definitely buy again.
5,Stylish Premium and High Quality the Surface Mouse is just what I was looking for.  With and aluminum wheel and great battery life I highly recommend this product to anybody looking for a great mouse !
1,The sensor (or possibly the blue tooth connection not sure) on the mouse is terrible and constantly causes my cursor to stutter. I know it's not supposed to be doing this because my mouse will be working perfectly fine then randomly start shitting the bed and (as if it's own personal frame rate has been lowered) start jumping around as I move it rather than 'dragging' across the screen as a good mouse would. After not being in use for a few minutes (less than 10) the mouse will enter a 'sleep mode' a sleep mode that it won't wake up from by simply clicking or moving. oh no. I LITERALLY have to flip my mouse upside down and back to my mouse pad to get it to function normally after every few minutes of sitting idle. Imagine sitting watching a 5-minute clip and having to make your mouse do a summersault to use it again. USELESS! Just writing this review i had to do it twice! I own a junky Logitech mouse that's over 5 years old and eats batteries like cookies that STILL works better than this! I expected a certain build quality from Microsoft though I'd be hard-pressed to find a difference between this mouse and a cheap Chinese knock off. $30 for this? It belongs on the shelf of a 7-11 for $10 next to a bag of Cheetos. Save your money and buy a knock off it'll work just as well.
5,Wasn't sure if I would like this mouse due to the shape & size.  But I love it.  It fit nicely into laptop sleeve.  Fits perfect in my my hand & I have had no problems with it connecting with my Surface Pro 6.
1,Great design terrible quality. Out of the box the scroll wheel barely functioned. Now almost 2 years later it is useless. You scroll in a direction and it jumps both up and down leaving you right where you were. I had a feeling the sensor for the wheel was bad when I first got it. Some days were worse than others. Now after a week of the scroll wheen not functioning even after a cleaning I'm giving up on this POS. Microsoft should be ashamed of this product.
5,Pretty great buy Honestly.
5,Super fast connectivity. Simple switch to turn on and off the Bluetooth. The battery flip up door is so easy to open and change batteries. Very sleek it fits the top pocket of my backpack where I usually carry my glasses.
5,It‚Äôs very good and comfortable mouse. I had apple magic mouse for afew years but this one is much better and sharper. works  with Mac pro.
4,Happy with this mouse. It works really well. Comfortable with a great battery life and good range.
3,This will be a short review as I am not a techie person. The mouse was easy enough to pair with my surface laptop 2 and works well and good. My biggest gripe is that it comes with 2 AAA batteries. No recharge port no way to charge the darn thing. I'll have to buy rechargeable AAA batteries to keep from generating more unnecessary waste. What a poor design for a mouse... it's even a Microsoft product.. what a joke. Anyway the product works fine as I said I just wish they would have made this more compatible with today's chargeable device generation.
5,I have been using this more than a year and it is working perfectly. No issues whatsoever. I would highly recommend
5,Great mouse well worth the money. I was leery about getting a blue tooth mouse but after numerous lost dongles I took a chance in this one. I‚Äôm glad I did. I travel for my job and this works out perfectly. Highly recommended!
5,Does exactly what I want it to do. The battery life is great it‚Äôs a sleek design the clicks are quiet and the bluetooth connects instantly - no lag time!
5,Item works great and the shipping was super fast! Would buy from this seller again!
4,UPDATED:(if you left the mouse untouched for a minute it goes to sleep right away it‚Äôs kinda frustrating) so smooth and precise. I wish it was rechargeable and it has auto sleep option because I manually have to turn it off to save the battery life.
5,It immediately connects and works well with my Surface Go.  The color also matches my Surface Pen and Surface Type Cover.  Very small and easy to carry around.  Have not had to replace batteries yet though it isn't used too often.
5,Great product! This my second mouse for my laptop. First mouse was a generic brand that had a difficult time connecting and holding the Bluetooth signal. Went with this mouth for my Microsoft position and this one connects and holds the connection!
5,Perfect for my surface pro 6. I was looking to get the arc mouse but didnt want to spend a ridiculous amount on a mouse. This is a perfect compromise of premium feel and value. Pairs nicely with my SP6. Easy connectivity and good battery life
5,Nice mouse. Hooked up automatically to my Surface. Works well. Replaced the arc with this. Very happy.
4,It is Hard to click! Compares to other mouse it needs me to click it harder. That‚Äôs annoying and not comfortable at all. And the sound I can hardly say it is silent. Overall unbelievable it is a Microsoft device.
5,It's all great but after using Logitech's for a long time it was a bit hard to adjust to it.
5,The mouse is easy to use easily connected to my computer bluetooth performs well on bright and dark surfaces
4,Great mouse except for one flaw the power button. Even though it's on the bottom and a bit recessed it still powers on in my bag. I have resorted back to my arc mouse for travel and this one stays home.
4,I initially bought this product thinking it was rechargeable. It's not but that's my fault for not fully reading the specifics about it. Mouse works well connects to my surface pro 5 well. I just wish it were rechargeable.
5,It's easy to use.  Works great.But not sure how to turn it off.
5,I love the quality on this mouse. For a travel mouse you're not sacrificing a lot functionality at all compared to a desktop mouse. Connectivity is simple and dependable it looks great feels pretty good (takes a few sessions to get used to it) scrolling wheel is very solid and smooth feeling. Tracking is spot-on and high resolution. I'm very pleased with this purchase.
5,It fits in my hand pretty nicely.  Connectivity is great attached to my surface pro 7 immediately.  Has a power button on the bottom so you can turn it off when you aren't using it.  I like it.
5,I‚Äôm so happy with my product it works fine on my device thanks for your business
5,Nice lightweight comfortable to use and travel-friendly. Some people may need more time to adapt to this kind of shape as they are used to mouse with a big hump. I'm seeing complaints about the scrolling wheel stop working after a few months will update regarding durability if anything happens later.
5,I like  the comfortable feel up use and the wheel for  up and down movement
5,Pretty nice high-quality mouse at the price point. Mine was blue and is made of a nice material that is smooth to the touch. Haptic feedback is good and the mouse works as described working especially will with my surface pro
5,Microsoft Surface Mobile Mouse (Cobalt Blue)  Purchased for Surface GO hate that touchpad.  It works great!  Added two AAA batteries and pressed the on button...poof  It has been working great.  No problems.  Easy button on bottom.....syncs turns on/off.  Great Purchase.  Love that it is Bluetooth and doesn't need an USB transmitter.
5,I was needing a mouse with a range longer than a regular wireless one. When I saw this Bluetooth one on sale I went for it. I like the color and it has been reliable for me. It moves smoothly and evidently goes to sleep when not in use because the batteries are lasting a long time.
5,Bought this for my surface pro when it was on sale. I truly love this connects via Bluetooth it‚Äôs not too small not to big. I don‚Äôt use it as often as many other people will but have not changed the battery up to date so pretty solid mouse.
3,It's so small and thin. I believe it to be good for travelling but it's also too small for normal sized hands to operate smoothly. One big turn off is when it's on it interferes with the wifi so much that you simply can't browse the website without connecting an adaptor with a LAN hub. So the mobility of the mouse defeats the whole purpose of mobility of Surface.
4,It is a mouse and it works only with the Surface.
5,Really great looking and comfortable to use! Nice and flat so very easy to throw in my computer sleeve too!
5,It worked like it is supposed to work.
5,Bought one for my Mom as well and she loves it.  Easy setup and works great!!
5,I keep this mouse in my work bag and use it when I work from home or another office.  It's a touch small for everyday use but it works very well.
5,Maybe not the most ergonomic mouse but it is expected for this size this is why I still give 5 stars. Easy to connect.It can be turned on/off by the little button underneath (not very obvious).
5,Liked the size very portable. Easily connected to my device! Connects instantly and im not having to reconnect. Would definitely recommend to anyone!
5,I purchased this because I didn‚Äôt want to keep using my laptop‚Äôs mouse pad. At work I use a wired mouse and find it so much more efficient to work and create with.This mouse is comfortable very lightweight and doesn‚Äôt click loud. Looks professional and modern too‚Äîalmost like Apple‚Äôs magic mouse.I recommend üëçüèº
5,I have a grey Surface laptop and this was the best purchase I could ever made. The colors matched perfectly and off course no cables no stress üòå
5,This is the best Bluetooth mouse I've ever used and it's the perfect balance between not taking up much space in your laptop bag while still feeling comfortable in your hand.
5,This Surface mouse is the perfect match to my surface pro 7 it connects with no issues and feels nice in the hand if you have the surface this is a must!
5,It's good. The battery life is long. I changed battery after I used it for more than one year. Notes: I use it at least 4 hours every day.
4,...shipped quickly. great packaging. nice slim slick look and fit
5,Works well. BT radio in it is never weak or choppy with mousing performance.This mouse is not the most comfortable for me - its low profile and I have big hands. It works very well satisfying scroll wheel.
5,Bought this to use with my Microsoft Go. Worked immediately. Had to get used to it not being as deep as my regular mouse but that didn‚Äôt take long st all. I bought it in blue as it matches my Finte case I have for the Go. Makes using the device so much easier.
5,So far so good! The slick design beautifully compliments my surface pro 7. Seamlessly connects with my device and functions properly. Battery replacement compartment is magnetic to enable easy access to the batteries. Great buy!
5,Amazing mouse. The best wireless charger I've ever used. Easy to set up and batteries last extremely long. Better than the Surface Mouse for anyone who is looking at both.
4,It is a good mouse. Easy to set up. Responsive and feels good in hands. Seems to be a quality product. Like the form factor too that it has clean lines.
5,Su conectividad es excelente la tablet Surface pro lo detect√≥ de forma inmediata. Su dise√±o es ergon√≥mico y bastante est√©tico. Estoy feliz con el producto. Lo recomiendo.
5,Very comfortable...easy set-up.
5,Pricey mouse but a great companion to any Surface Pro.  This mouse has smooth & quick Bluetooth connectivity and it doesn‚Äôt take up another lacking usb slot on your computer. The rolling finger scroll is superior.  Great quality and worth the price.
5,Works great!
5,Great mouse works on all kinds of surfaces even when Im sitting in bed on the covers. Its small connects instantly and is lightweight perfect for portability.
1,I bought it 2 yrs ago and it doesn't work any more.
5,Not the biggest fan of how the mouse fits in my hand but it certainly gets the job done. Very easy to pair and there‚Äôs no hassle with a USB piece.
5,I love this mouse. It‚Äôs so sleek. It requires batteries but they‚Äôve lasted a long time and I forget to turn it off. It automatically connect to my MacBook when I push the little Bluetooth button. It fit my hand perfect not too small.
5,Love this mouse! I bought it for my Surface Book 2. I don‚Äôt always like using the touchpad because I feel like touchpads are not as precise as an actual mouse. This is very compact (yet still feels natural) and fits inside the pocket on my laptop sleeve. It‚Äôs incredibly responsive.
5,Loved the color and form.
5,Perfect size mouse for my Surface Go. All I had to do was take it out of the box and it was ready to use. No set up at all. Light weight smooth comfortable and just a very nice looking mouse.
5,Easy set up and works perfectly with the surface.
4,Low profile mouse. Perfect for my wife's hand. A little small for mine but working very well.
5,Muy buen producto
5,I bought to use with my new surface book 2. I love it. Easy to pair it via bluetooth. Very thin but yet very comfortable to use. I travel daily and use it multiple times a day. No issues turning it off and on all day. It connects everytime.
4,I like the design it looks nice. I have a surface go and it is pretty portable to carry but not very comfortable comparing with other brand mouse.
5,is not ergonomic for work long timei love the feelinglove the colorconnectivity
4,The connection losts sometime. Got this type of issue with 2 devices.
5,the mouse has an amazing battery life with the pair of batteries that came with it it is easy to connect and feels good in the hand. I would totally recommend this mouse.
5,I love how this fits almost perfectly in my hand and its ease of use. I highly recommend it and would buy it again.
5,This is my first wireless mouse and it works very well. I have a co worker who also utilizes this mouse at work on her surface go and had nothing but good things to say about the product. I like it so far with no issues.
5,Good mouse with surface and other Bluetooth laptops. Has a long battery life
5,Great mouse momentally connected to my Surface Laptop 2 works great comfortable the plastic is very beautiful and soft touch. I'm an electronics engineer and work with some CAD software and I can say that this mouse isn't for professional use it's for scrolling your internet pages and so.
5,Excellent all-purpose Bluetooth mouse. Solid build quality the sensor works on all surfaces including glass. The battery life is great and it uses batteries so there is no need for recharging. It works exactly as advertised and also looks and feels good to use.
5,Awesome mouse works great
5,Love love love these! Perfect size for travel. Easy to pair with my Surface devices. Great battery life
5,Bought it to go with my Surface Pro 6 which only has 1 USB port. The mouse connects via Bluetooth freeing up the valuable port for something else. Love it.
5,N/A
4,I havnt use this product yet but it looks really good.
4,This is my third one.....Only because I keep losing them cause I am a dope. Product works great.
5,Looks and feels great I love the look. Matches the case I got for it super easy to connect to.
5,I replaced my broken Arc mouse with this mouse. A new Arc mouse was a lot more expensive than one purchased. The new mouse was easy to connect and I find it "user friendly".
4,The mouse is small and a good price and does not require a physical connector but it is slightly smaller for my hands.
5,beside the Razor  I think this is the best one I had so good
4,Smooth operation precise works great. The thing I do not like are the button clicks: loud as heck. I'm considering returning it cause I think they're rather annoying.
4,Mouse is a great fit with my Surface Pro light and good response .
5,Matched well into the surface go with smooth operation!
5,Same color as his Surface.  Connected with ease and hope battery life is as good as they say it is.  Will repost down the road when I know how long it lasts.
5,Excellent. Slimmer than the modern variant but just as ergonomic if not more so.
5,So happy with my purchase at first I  did not think I was going to need it for ny surface but boy was i wrong i decided to buy it and have used it ever since.  Bluetooth connectivity was super easy.
4,Good bt mouse
4,Works great feels great but has a CLICK loud enough to keep people awake. Why was that necessary?
5,I love this lil thing I have been searching for a mouse to compliment my surface pro. This  has a low profile which makes it easy to pack away for traveling. Bluetooth and battler life is also good
5,Connected to my surface go once. Been working ever since. Just need to remember to turn it off before storing it. Love the functionality and the ease of use. Works every time! Haven‚Äôt found a surface that it didn‚Äôt work on.
5,This mouse provides a very smooth and pleasant user experience.  I love the cobalt blue and how it actually matches my cobalt blue laptop.  Bluetooth worked as expected.  Mouse is flat and easily transported.
1,Problem 1. Switching between my mac and my PC I had to delete the device from the bluetooth menu and reconnect each time. That's like 8 menus and 20 painful seconds of work just to use my device. I like to switch devices often. This is a common problem.Problem 2. Left click stopped working after 1 year. It either misses a click or double-clicks or gets stuck in click-down. I am able to confirm this using a click tester app.Bummer because the look and feel of this mouse was nice batter life and ranger were good. More plastic and rare earth metals going in the trash! I hope Microsoft accepts my warranty RMA!
4,Comfortable and easy touse
4,Nice feel when working on my computer but the arrow gets stuck a lot on the screen.  I may need to put another set of batteries in.
5,I use the surface pro and the scroll wheel of the original mouse that came with it was not working well. I bought this mouse as replacement and it works like a charm. There are no issues at all. Works really well.
5,Works like a champ
5,BEST MOUSE EVER
5,I needed a fairly portable fully functional 3 button mouse with a scroll wheel. This mouse is fairly flat and small without being Lilliputian like so many portable laptop mice. Easy to pair with my Surface Pro 6.
5,I love this product
3,Le falta m√°s altura para que se ajuste mejor a la mano.
5,Best purchase ever! I had a little trouble at first when i was trying to connect the mouse. But once i got it connected it has been super great to use!
4,Great mouse but seems to freeze or skip a little bit every once in a while.
5,Good looking mouse works great!!  Easy to connect to my laptop.  I really like that it doesn't take up one of my USB inputs.
4,Great mouse for the price. The only thing I dont like is the fact it isn't re-chargeable and the battery cover comes off very easily.
5,Great mouse! It does take batteries but they last forever. I have mine connected to my HP laptop. Works great very smooth and quiet.
5,It‚Äôs great. Thanks. It even arrived earlier than expected!
5,Pretty darn thing which is nice for packing but feels fine in the hand.Tracks well on all surfaces I've tried so far.Connection has been flawless so far.Haven't had long enough to comment on battery life
4,I wish this mouse has an on/off switch. Sadly it doesn't have one.
5,Looks good and works great.
4,A little too flat for my hands and too slippery. I do like the small size of it when I am traveling.
5,Love this bluetooth mouse so quick and easy to set up with any laptop with bluetooth capabilities. You don't have to worry about losing that little USB thing that comes with most wireless mouses! You just turn it on and you're good to go!
5,Bluetooth connectivity could be better.
5,Works seemlessly
5,It works great with my surface pro 6 the mouse is really slim so its ultra portable. It's kind of uncomfortable during long periods of time due to it's slim form factor.
2,the bottom of the mouse where the batteries go is magnetic and does not clip in causing the slightest bump to drop the cover and batteries. in a bookbag or laptop case every time i open it the cover and batteries are loose in the case. No on/off switch. works well other than that just very basic
5,It is just a well designed well integrated mouse.
5,Fits very nicely with my Surface Pro 6 connected right away. Comfortable and responsive. Love that it connects via Bluetooth and I don't have to deal with any wireless mouse receiver taking up my USB port.
3,I like the feel and design; I've never had connectivity issues battery issues etc. BUT left click is wearing out and very inconsistent. Tried to walk through a warranty process with Microsoft online. Yuck.
5,Only once so far did it not automatically connect to my Surface Pro 6 and I blame Windows 10 for that and a reboot of the computer fixed it.
5,This is a very easy size for my hand - none of the goofy shapes that have come and gone - pretty natural to use. It was easy to setup just like the description said.
3,Don't like the way the cursor resolution is jaggy
3,Works alright the scroll often will work when I initially connect but then quickly looses its functioning. The rest of the mouse works fine so I figured I‚Äôd keep it. My husband has the same one in black with the same problem.
4,No issues
5,Easy to sync very responsive on any surface great battery life!
4,Works great
5,Great form factor. Slim but not too short for my taste. Super fast and hassle-free connectivity. Everything else just works the way it should. Some people might not get accustomed to the slim form factor.
5,So far the finest sleekest ad most comfortable mouse I've owned over the years. Easily pairs and perfect size for travel. Did have to re-pair at one point but did so easily and no problems since.
4,I like the design very much  good quality and reasonable price
5,Connected immediately nice form factor that doesn‚Äôt take much room in the bag while fitting the hand nicely.
5,I love it just what I expected to be
5,I bought this to use with my Surface 3. It connected right away and works the way I expect it to. It continues to be very dependable.
5,Matches my surface laptop perfectly described!
4,Occasional connectivity issues but mostly great.
3,Connection is not great ‚Äì often lags after not having moved it for a couple minutes. The mouse is designed to be portable so it‚Äôs slim but this doesn‚Äôt make for the most comfortable mouse.
5,This mouse looks like Apple's Magic Mouse but don't be fooled; it scrolls smoothly and is light weight but heavy enough to have some substance. It is the best cordless mouse I've ever used.
5,The size makes it very portable and easy to store in a bag.  Additionally to date it appears to work on almost any surface without the need of a mouse pad.  The blue tooth connectivity was easy.
5,Love it. Beautiful design and great functionality.
5,Great for Macbook
5,Easy to setup Easy to use and The battery lasts a long time.It does what i got it for.
5,I use iPad 3 with 12.9 inches. Pairing is better than Magic Mouse. I'm sorry not to use it on the surface but it is still very good.
5,Great mouse for the laptop bag. Low profile so doesn't add a bulge to your bag. Very usable. Only complaint is I wish it had a 'back' and 'forward' button on the side.
5,Easy to connect and works perfectly!
2,This device has Lousy  connectivity! This is the 2nd Surface mouse I've had. The 1st one I sent back because of it's inability to stay connected to my Surface pro and this one is no better.. On average I have to reinstall it on a daily basis sometimes I get really lucky and it lasts for 2 days. Why is Microsoft selling an inferior product that was not ready for consumer use is beyond me. If it would stay connected I would give it a 5 star ratting but as it is a 2 or 3 at best!
5,So easy!!
4,A mouse for regular users of surface pro
5,works perfectly looks good quality is good the most important thing is it save a USB plug. But is do has the 'click' sound.
5,I was looking for something that was small enough to travel with but large enough to use.  This works well.  I just turn it off when I am not using it to conserve on batteries
5,So far its working good. It was easy to pair with surface and use it few minutes. It also so light and easy to pack it in the sleeve for surface pro.
5,Works great and looks great with surface. I usually avoid Bluetooth mice because of connection issues but this one has been grwat
5,Buen producto
5,works well  wish it had a manual on off button because i'm not sure if it get turned on off while in the bag ; i hv to take out batteries .
5,Love this mouse. Super simple to connect fits well in the hand super portable and quality of the buttons and scroll wheel feels satisfying. The batteries are even included.For $30 you honestly can't go wrong!
5,Works great
5,Connects everytime I try and use it.  No issues at all.  Wish I got it earlier.
5,No USB receiver stable Bluetooth connection easy to throw in a small backpack alobg with Surface Pro. Batteries will pop out of if you drop it but otherwise great mouse.
5,Connected quickly.. I bought it for my Surface Book 2 because when I disconnect the screen a corded mouse has no way to connect so this works perfectly. The silver really looks nice.
5,I like this mouse but I didn't realize it would be so clicky. Clicking sounds are pretty loud.
5,Perfect mouse. Connects right away and still have yet to change the battery. Just wish my surface came with this guy from the beginning.
5,I love it  works great ! hook up was no problem glides smoothly & nice size ! Works  perfectly  for me ! And the price was worth it.
3,Loved it - responsive timing fast to use - but stopped working within 10 months :(Most mice last longer than that.
5,Works for me~
5,Excellent use it 8 hours per day and its so comfortable to use. Thank you for this amazing product
5,Looks good works good no issues in the short time I've had it.
5,I love the look feel and works amazing - never loose connectivity
5,MS Suface Mouse is my portable mouse.  Works well and connect immediately when I need.  Is made with high quality material able to withstand my travel.
5,Bought this for my new Surface Book 2 and it compliments it very well. Smooth use and very fast. It is also small enough to store away in backpack.
4,It was less meat then I expected
5,Great product. Much better than traditional mouse. Eliminated USB adaptor and freed up USB port
5,I think this is a great product. The battery cover comes off easily its magnetic just pull it off. I didnt know that at first.
5,Nice model very light
5,Bought for use with my Surface Pro. Small enough to fit in the front zipper pocket of my work bag. Works immediately and works great!
1,This mouse is a sad product for having a microsoft name.  The double click only works part of the time the sensitivity is slow the scroll wheel is very choppy at best.  The only thing nice about it is that it is light weight.  Ergonomics of it it is not comfortable to use.
5,Bought this after my arc mouse was brutally attacked by my husband's beagle. It looks nice and feels good in your hand.
5,Great Bluetooth mouse.
5,I wanted a Bluetooth mouse for my Macbook Pro but did not want to pay for the Apple Smart Mouse. This works so well connects easily and very satisfied.
5,Small size slips into backpack pockets easily. Best of the Microsoft mouse lineup.
5,I love this mouse. It matches my Surface Pro and it is quite thin so that it doesn't bulge my backpack.
5,What I like about this mouse is that it works - a very useful characteristic when comparing it to other mice.
5,Connects immediately and then just works like a mouse should. Quality is good for a plastic mouse. NOTE >> This works well on a fabric bed spread where other mice don't/won't. Recommended.
5,This mouse is very comfortable  and one great quality is that it will work on any surface.It color matches my surface go keyboard. I would sugest this mouse to anyone .
5,Great portable mouse.  Easy to set up...just turn it on and turn on your device. Easy peasy.  Travels well.  No crazy random mouse movements with the scroll wheel either.
5,Seems like a genuine Microsoft product. Not great for long use but it's nice and sleek.
5,It worked as promised
5,Unbelievably thin mouse that connected seamlessly with my SurfacePro
5,An awesome mouse for productivity and use on the go. Works on a bed as well. Material feels great to touch. Wheel is great as well.
5,Very good ergonomics and runs well on most surfaces. Great for left-handed people like me too!
5,I absolutley love this mouse. I no longer have pain in my hand.
5,Work/School/Pleasure
5,Great battery life and connected to my surface very easily
5,I like it but for the price the batteries should be rechargeable or something
5,This is great for a MacBook because it doesn't require a USB port.
5,Great
5,Great compact travel mouse. Very flat and packs well in my laptop case. Works very well. Worth the price.
5,It's a High quality product. works perfect.I don't know why it goes to sleep after a few mins if you click it wakes up right away
5,Very nice but to "unpack" I fear the Amazon community/LEFT may censor my review or comment if they disagree.
5,Very comfortable to use . Great connectivity and battery life.
5,Nice mouse but was too low for my hand.Returned them already
5,Very sleek and comfortable on the hand. Color is pretty.
5,The color is the exact match to my microsoft surface 2 cobalt blue laptop. Connects well.
5,Light comfortableI have it only a few weeks and so far OK
5,It works great with my Surface Pro.  It is small enough to slip into my bag and works on any surface.  Connects with ease.
5,Perfect for my surface tablet. Easy to use and compatible with most of the other bluetooth devices.
3,Has trouble connecting almost everyday. I have to mess with it for about 30 minutes to get it to be discoverable and actually connect. Most times my surface can‚Äôt even locate the mouse.
4,I like the size and the Bluetooth connectivity
5,Well such a good mouse I can not fault it in any aspect.
5,Thin light and slimline.  Comfortable.  It does click kinda loudly. I wish there was one that had a quiet click.
5,Bought this for my husband wish I had gotten myself one
5,High quality product with a very modern and ergonomic design.  Works with Surface Go.
5,It connect to my surface pro quickly I had no problem connecting it. I recommend this product if your looking for some nice at a reasonable price.
1,I received this today 18-02-2020It worked fine at first but half an hour later clicking didn't seem to have much of an effect. I can move the courser scroll up and down but it requires considerable pressure to get the left button to work. At first I thought the problem lied with the surface laptop which I also received today. I turned it off and on again because there was no response what so ever. When I tried the touch pad I managed to open my apps.It's quite sad that a product would malfunction half an hour after use! I'll be contacting amazon for a refund.P.S. the mouse is not comfortable to use. In addition to the fact that you have to exert some pressure to get a response for the clicks the shape of the mouse does not support the hand properly.
5,Got this for my surface 6 pro... then they announce the 7.. FML
5,Good purchase. Sleek stylish and fast
5,Good product
5,Item is as expected and received timely.
5,Easy to hook up and use.Feels nice in hand.
5,awesome mouse you feel premium but it is not good for a big hand not ergonomically fit to your hands.. but this is what it is.
5,Fantastic product paired easily with my surface pro4  no issues or complaints till now
1,During normal use for some reason I never understood it has lapses of about 2 seconds every 10 min: you are working moving the mouse normally then suddenly it stops responding for 2 seconds.  Very annoying.  I realized it was this mouse after I stopped using it and started using another one.  After 2 years of use the buttons start failing: they sometimes respond and sometimes don't.  Again I only realized when I got a new mouse.  For a while I though it was something about my computer instead.
4,good
5,It never has to charge great and very light. Was very easy to pair with my surface pro. Love it!
5,I absolutely hate working on my laptop without a mouse. This device is so amazing and sleek. Easy to use and pairs via Bluetooth. Would buy again!!!
5,Good
3,Works fine but Amazon sent me a mouse from its used-product warehouse but advertised it as new.
5,Es ergon√≥mico tama√±o adecuado eficiente en uso bater√≠a y a muy buen precio.
5,I love this mouse it is pretty comfortable and easy to use
5,Love itGreat product. Works well with my pro
5,Can't really name any bad things about this wireless mouse its elegant easy to use and fast. Super comfortable one of my best online purchases!
5,Just wish I could turn it off manually to save battery life.
5,I used this as my iPadOS mouse connects well and very functional.Only wish it matches the color.
5,Excellent Product
5,Live the color and sleek feel of it in my hand
5,Paired immediately and is very comfortable to isey
5,bluetooth is so much easier.  love it
5,Great for those who prefer a mouse.
5,I‚Äôve only had this mouse for about a month but it‚Äôs great! It paired with my surface pro in seconds! Works flawlessly!
5,It was so much less expensive to purchase this mouse at Amazon.  Same product and no disappointments.
5,fits the hand very well operates on any surface and being blue tooth it does not require a USB connector
5,Good deal through Amazon
4,It is good enough
5,Great wireless mouse!!
5,WORKS LIKE IT SUPPOSED TO!!
5,Great product and works perfectly with my Surface Go.
5,Easy set up & easy to use. Comfortable.
5,Great product delivered and posted quickly and item is as described. Easy to use setup and connect to surface. Highly recommend.
5,light and works smoothly. I carry it in my bag every day to work.
5,I like that the product is easy to setup and use. I wish that the unit turns off when the Windows Surface does.
5,Have a Microsoft Arc mouse already but wanted a more conventional feeling mouse for daily use. This mouse feels great.
5,M'soft did their homework on this one. It certainly meets all my needs for an electronic rodent.
3,Flaky drops off Bluetooth even when connected to my surface.  Microsoft stick to OS development and let Logitech build peri gear...
5,Good price for good product
5,Easy to connect Bluetooth and once you connect it one time it connects everytime you want to use it
5,Simple efficient great battery life.. would buy again
5,Connects easily to Microsoft surface and eliminates need to take the only USB connection for your mouse. Very impressed with function/quality.
4,Portable and durable
3,Extremely low profile design. So if you have a claw grip it might be a difficult mouse to use.  Not very ergonomic but great battery life and cheapest among the usable mice for work.
5,I work remotely often and this mice is perfect for travel and office use.
5,Great value quality look and functionality.
5,Easy to connect and works on all surfaces
5,Perfect connectivity just wish it was a tad bigger. Otherwise I love it
5,Lightweight slim design easy to use and fits comfortably in my hand. I have used it on different surfaces and it works great. I like it!
5,Very easy to connect. Nicely made. Design is beautiful. Works perfect so far.
5,This has turned out to be a perfect mouse.
5,Love it for its Bluetooth connectivity. Was super easy to set up.
5,Good
3,Profile is too low to be a comfortable everyday mouse. Slim profile works better as a travel mouse. Bluetooth connection works seamlessly with the Surface Book 2. I see myself using this mouse for a long time.
5,Great value and works perfect very durable
5,I have one for my laptop and 1 for my desktop works great on any surface.
3,This mouse isn't comfortable for the wrist at all! But the Arc mouse is better and more comfortable even though it's more expensive. I'd to return this product and buy the Arc mouse. Works perfectly with my Surface Go!
5,I like this mouse very easy to connect with my Surface laptop. Very slim makes it easy to be carried around with the laptop.
5,Great. The little wheel is needed for ACAD program and this is perfect. Made work much easier
5,Nice product with a simple design. Connects immediately to my Surface Pro 3 and has not had a single issue.
5,If you are looking for something simple done really well then this is your mouse.
5,Just what I needed for my Surface Pri
2,Over a few months the primary left mouse button has become unreliable and has forced me to replace the mouse. Aesthetically it is quite nice and sleek/simple. Unfortunately the performance and durability are what relegated this to being a paperweight now.Also don't like the fact that after taking the top off a few times the plastic clips that hold it in place broke.
5,It has a quick response time between commands and it fits really great in the palm of your hand.
1,Have a Logi BT mouse that would pair but only connect on cold boot to our Microsoft Surface Pro 7. So I bought this thing. It's not nearly as comfortable as my Pebble M350. It bluetooth-pairs just as fine as the LogiPebble but also only connects on cold boot to the Surface. Yep the MICROSOFT mouse won't connect to the MICROSOFT computer in the same way that a third party mouse won't. I then find out it's a known issue. So it's BAD CODING YET AGAIN SATYA. But by all means keep on smiling as I return your hardware and buy Apple next time. (Because You Suck!)Sorry for the ire readers but this really shouldn't be offered for sale if it's ALREADY broken in the box.
5,Exactly as advertised. I use it a lot.
5,Great price and easy to use
5,Installed in 10 seconds fast and smooth. I like it and it frees up my USB port.
3,It will periodically lose connection quite annoying
5,Good quality and easy to connect.
5,I'm used it with my surface pro 3 and pro 5 and works perfectly every time
5,This mouse is awesome. Matches my Surface Pro. I love it.
5,Easy to connect low profile fits in my hand perfectly.
5,As mentioned before better than my Mac mouse!!
5,Perfect fit in hand good tracking and movement across different surfaces.
5,Great product for the price.
5,Easy to connect and use. Love this product! Works great with my Surface Go
5,I love these line want something simple reliable super comfortable and beautiful. Get this mouse.
5,Great mouse for my Surface pro. Super easy to carry around and easy to pair. Works great.
5,Does what I need. Too soon to tell on battery
2,Mouse has 100% power  but blue light does not come on.  mouse does not response.  when  power button  is held on it tries to pair again.  no support options that i  can find.
3,Mouse works pretty good. Only thing that‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt work is the scrolling wheel. Tired on 2 different computers still not able to get it to work
5,Works great!
5,It's a mouse and does what it's supposed to do!!
5,I like everything about it.
5,My Surface Pro recognized it as soon as i put the batteries in works like a dream.
5,Works great. Links up and now I have a free USB port!
5,use it everyday dropped it once still awesome
5,Travel mouse light and storeable
5,Exactly what you want for a wireless mouse. In every way. I love it.
2,It came in with the click not working. We bought another one that was OK. But It just fell on the carpet ( and not a hard surface) and the click stopped working. I think it‚Äôs super sensitive to any kind of it. I don‚Äôt recommend it at all.
5,This is my favorite mouse! Sleek and easy to use!
5,I use it for personal use.  This product performs and stores perfectly
5,No problems and very smooth.
1,The battery life on this is pretty unbelievable.  Got this to replace my iMacs magic mouse.  I needed a middle button.. The only thing that would make this better is if the clicks where silent and not so.. "clicky" but the battery life outweighs that.From 5 stars to 1 star.UPDATE:  12/7/2019 - less than 7 months later and almost exactly 2 weeks after support ran out - the mouse no longer works and malfunctions consistantly.  Does not hold on to elements when clicking and dragging and does pretty much whatever it wants.  Not sure I would purchase this again.  Too bad because it was ALMOST perfect... I knew it was too good to be true.
5,Very comfortable fit in your hand. Connects easily to surface Pro. Clean sleek design.
5,I appreciate it's slender design which fits in bags without being too bulky.
5,Cozy convenience
5,One of the best surface accessories I‚Äôve used. Works right out of the box sleek style quality feel.
5,Smooth operation. No stagger
5,I love this mouse for my surface. I also love love love the color I purchased burgundy.
5,It is very comfortable in my hand but too bad that needs battery. Wish it is chargeable.
5,Best OPTICAL mouse I own !
5,Small compact snd easy  to use. M glad i bought this mouse.
5,Love this wireless mouse! Would definitely recommend it...
5,Husband uses it all the time
5,Good color match with type cover.  Make sure you connect through Bluetooth.
5,Good product. I use it for the surface purchased
5,Just good enough for everything
5,Works perfectly with my surface laptop 2 of the same color.
5,This mouse is solid and comfortable to use. It is a bit flatter than most mice.
5,design is perfect simpleworking
5,Love how compact this mouse is. Great for travel.
3,For over $30 for a mouse I expected much more. It feels inexpensive and isn't very accurate. Apple does a much better job with its Magic Mouse.
5,Perfect product! Exactly what was described and exactly what I needed.
5,As
1,This mouse goes in standby mode (to save battery) after a few seconds only and when you touch it again you have to move it for about 5 seconds for it to start working again. Just super annoying.Not recommended.I can't remember a single time Microsoft has made a great product anyway so I should have known that. It's a miracle that this company is still alive after such a history of constantly buggy products.
1,This was great until it wasn‚Äôt. Stopped working and won‚Äôt connect any longer. Bummer.
5,Love it! Easy to use!
5,Great click and click-wheel and you don't have to sacrifice aesthetics or functionality in exchange for portability.
5,It's a bit small so it needs some getting used to. Other than that a great product.
5,Wife loves it
5,Nice gadget to my surface 6 pro!
5,Love my mouse! I rather the mouse than the track pad. It‚Äôs so light and efficient.
3,This is exactly the same design as Microsoft's original 'Designer Mouse' except the materials and quality is WAY cheaper. Feels almost like a toy.
5,Was perfect for what I needed.
5,Connected and worked immediately after powering up.
5,Very satisfied
5,Na
5,Great product
5,Great product. I like the feel. Just wish it had the buttons to 'go back'.

5,Great so far!
5,Sleek travels well and I love mine!
5,Good
5,works well. no problems with connectivity.
5,Love the shape and color. Works very well.
2,I use this bluetooth mouse in non-MS Surface tablet setting with multiple laptops for home and work; and I find it difficult to like it.  Ergonomic wise the device is well built but is not necessarily the best to hold on to; the buttons are a bit hard to click.  I'm going back to a traditional wired mouse for comfort.
5,Works great
5,Works great! great addition
5,Works seamlessly
5,Exelent
5,The set up was effortless and it works smoothly and consistently. Great product!
5,Works very well!
5,Our teen uses this & Go for high school classes. Great duo.
5,Works perfect. Connected easily.  Looks great with burgundy keyboard.
5,Great product works well with my surface go.
5,Very slick and works great. Looks really nice.
5,Perfect and easy to carry around work well on my Microsoft surface go.
3,It was very easy to carry around but not a fan of the shape. It's not very comfortable to use.
2,Everything worked fine except that the mouse didn't sit flat on a desk/table. It literally rocked back and forth because there was a high spot on the bottom of the mouse. I checked carefully to make sure it wasn't dirt or any damage. Nope. Just a warped mouse. It doesn't sound like much but when you're actually using it it was super annoying. Maybe they're not all like this. Returned it.
5,Great
5,Easy to connect. Great ergonomicsLightweight mouse!
5,iv had no issues at all with it works great
5,Super light and works great. Love the slim design
5,Good product
2,I was looking for somewhat silent clicks (the same type of sound as when typing on mac computer). The clicks on this mouse are hard and loud. If you really like to hear the sound every time you click this is your type of mouse. As for me I am returning it.
5,Love this product. Works perfect for what I need it for.
5,Excelente trabaja genial y es f√°cil de conectar a la pc
5,Very comfortable ergonomic design.  Very smooth operation.  Happy with purchase.
5,Immediate connection
5,Excellent mouse
5,Sleek comfortable works well and responds quickly. Great price. I‚Äôd recommend it.
5,Easy to connect and use.
5,See above
2,Overall the mouse is fine however it will disconnect if left alone for a while and it takes a time to reconnect.  That is soooo annoying.  Sometimes it loses connection and the only way to get it working is reboot the computer.  I like the mouse but this would have been a non-starter if I knew when I bought it.  I would not buy this mouse again.
5,Perfect. Very satisfied.
5,Great product!!
5,Looks awesome:) love it
2,Drops connection regularly.  Power button doesn't always work.  Works fine when connected but too inconsistent to be functional.  Just not a good product.
5,Connects seemlessly to my laptop
5,Works well
5,It awesome and small
5,fits my small hands.. :)
5,Meets my expectation
5,Muy buen Raton. Lo uso con la Surface go

5,A little hard to understand but work great
5,Nice products works perfectly with my Dell 2-in-1
5,Perfect
2,Not a bad mouse if you are a mouse but too small to be comfortable- gives hand cramps.  Also the scroll wheel jumps around and randomly flies down or up a page erratically which is very frustrating.
5,Microsoft Laptop immediately responded to Bluetooth signal. I‚Äôm using it with Windows 10.
5,It does the job and its pretty
5,Super reliable small ergonomic and portable mouse
2,Read a review that stated to small for my hand.  Didn't take the advice and purchased anyway.  Well used 1 time placed back in original box and returned.  Too small for my hand.  Hard to use due to size.  Ordered Arc Mouse like I had before and back to normal.
5,Nice low profile mouse. Easy to sync with my computer.
5,This product is awesome!
5,Love it!
5,Works as described. Easy use.
1,I had a Microsoft Surface Mouse that lasted a few years then finally died.  I replaced it with another Microsoft Surface Mouse... The second one only lasted two months.
5,This works fine with my Surface Go.
5,Mouse works flawlessly so far. Easily connected via bluetooth.
5,It's very versatile and it looks great too.
5,Sync was easy fits well in hand.
5,Nice solid mouse.  Comfortable to use and no lag.
5,The best business mouse for Windows no doubt.
5,I love this mouse and really enjoy using it with my surface
5,Love this mouse.
5,This item is perfect perfect and perfect.
1,I've Purchased this one a few weeks ago.Since i got it there were bluetooth connectivity problems.I've been trying to reset it replace battery but still doesn't work.The WORST part is when i contacted there costumer service team I've been told I'll have to pay for return shipping label.Buy a product  that doesn't work and then have to pay for shipping cost isn't that great?!?!
2,The click on this mouse is loud and it feels like there is a slight delay and it does take more than a gentle push to click it.  After having it for a while I'm going to get another mouse because that noise just bothers me more than I thought it would.
2,Its not very comfortable and it drops connection like its going out of style. That might have something to do with Windows as I've used it with different wifi/BT cards on Linux machines and jumps into the "adequate" category. Skip this and get something that's worth a damn.
2,I can't get this new mouse to work smoothly. It freezes often especially if you leave the cursor stay in the same location for a little while. The cursor movement is quite jerky. I thought I was upgrading to a better wireless MS mouse when I ordered this one when the wheel on my previous MS Wireless Mouse 3500 stopped scrolling.
5,It is easy to use and comfortable
5,Feels good in hand.
5,No problems after a month of use. Flawless connection.
1,I bought this mouse thinking i was going to be able to pair with mac but I couldn‚Äôt.
5,I love my new surface go and all the accessories!
5,Great product Full functional Mouse
5,Works great looks just like computer
5,This mouse moves easily responds quickly and precisely.
5,Best mouse there is for the Surface PC.
5,I like it. Feel good!
3,It is OK. But there is no back forward button and the right click did not work properly.
5,Feels great under my hand.
5,Love it!! Great product for a reasonable price!
5,It works great!! Should have bought this sooner!
5,Awesome
5,Good mouse for the money.
5,Nice and slim.
2,Love this mouse but out of nowhere it won't connect. The Bluetooth won't turn on so it can't connect to a device anymore. Can't return anymore and just days out of the service support window. Researched the internet and this seems to be a common unfixable problem. Don't buy.
5,Excellent product üëç
5,Easy to connect straight out of the box.
5,Good mouse! Works as advertised.
5,N/A
5,Perfect for my Surface Pro Laptop!
5,cts the perfect mouse
5,Works great but a little difficult to use
5,Works perfect. Exactly what was needed and wanted.
5,Spot on for office use.
5,Awesome. Just like it should. Microsoft rocks!!
2,If you are looking to use it for mobility then look elsewhere because there is no on/off switch.I returned mine and got the more pricey Arc Sculpt Mouse.
5,Great mouse!
5,Love it. So comfortable.
1,Terrible product. Looks well-made but isn't. It's mildly ergonomic but at this price point it should be dual-mode and sport an on/off switch. In my case it worked one day and would never connect or pair with my laptop again.Logitech retains its crown as this MS mouse also fails to maintain a constant-on BT connection. What does that mean? When you stop moving for 3 seconds the connection drops and has to re-connect when your hand starts moving again. Highly aggravating for Excel users.
5,I prefer black color
1,It‚Äôs inconceivable to have a dead battery after 2 weeks of use?  Is this used or new product.
5,I love it so much...
5,Great product
1,I really loved this mouse but it broke after less than a year or use. I tried contacting Microsoft support multiple times and could not even get in touch with a real person. So disappointing.
2,This mouse has a very loud click noise.  I cannot use it in a quiet setting because of how loud and annoying it is.  Makes it rather worthless to me.  On the bright side the Bluetooth connectivity works great and the feel in the hand is good.
5,I like the Bluetooth functionality of this mouse.
5,Excellent item
5,good
5,Great value
5,Convenient and easy to use.
5,Performs as advertised
5,good
2,The mouses left click stopped working after a couple of months even after replacing batteries. Also the bluetooth connectivity was very finicky in the mouse would seemingly turn itself on at random. Kind've meh.
5,Sleek and effective
5,like
5,The product was exactly as desctibed
5,works so far
5,Smooth Mouse
2,This product is good but the bottom of my mouse that covers the battery compartment won't attach back on and doesn't seem to be broken anyone the mouse still works but kinda annoying to have that piece fall off.
5,Awesome
5,Just that i expected
5,Works well!
5,Great product!!
5,works great
5,Great Mouse  Very well made
5,Nice
5,Working good
3,Sometimes the mouse stop working don't know what happened.
5,Good! fast delivery
5,fine
5,good
5,Works great live it!
2,The on button is sensitive so it turns in easily. Which isn‚Äôt good given it is battery operated. It turns in while it is in my bag frustrating. So I take the battery out when I store it.
5,Best minimal mouse there is.
1,This mouse intermittently disconnects from my Surface while I'm using it and I have to turn bluetooth on and off again which is a particularly large pain now that my 3 year old Surface has to use a bluetooth keyboard (because it stopped working with the keyboard made for the Surface) and the touch screen is mostly dead spots.
5,Exelente y c√≥modo
2,I have purchased two of these and had connectivity issues. Not sure what the issue is. But it didn't work for me. I don't have problems with other bluetooth devices like external keyboards trackpads or mice.
5,Like
5,Amazing Mouse!!!!
5,Super comfortable to use!
5,Very good
5,works very well
5,Nothing wrongGooooood quality
5,Great!
3,Works like as you purchase
5,Works as expected
5,Great
5,Pretty good this item!
5,Bonkers
2,Mouse freezes frequently resulting in hard shut down.
1,This is the most uncomfortable mouse I‚Äôve ever used. after only several hours my wrist felt like it was going to fall off. It takes too much effort to click and the click noises are LOUD. Mouse is far too small for somebody with medium or large hands. I‚Äôd only recommend if you have small hands and you use only for short periods of time otherwise save yourself the trouble and the pain
1,I bought this as a travel mouse mostly for its form factor. I hardly used it two times successfully and every time I had to replace with new batteries. It does not switch on or it switches on at random. It drains the battery like nobodies business. I wish I took some action during the return window now Ill to go to Microsoft and check if they will refund me the monies.
5,Perfect!
5,NIce compact device.
1,I bought it 2 months ago i like it because it so small and it doesn‚Äôt need include 1 usb to connect with my surface. But every time when i start my Surface i have to re-connect the mouse with my laptop. But it doesn‚Äôt work at one time I Connected i have to remove and pair it 2 or 3 time and reset my latop until it work. I‚Äôm so disappointed.
5,loved it
5,A+
5,Awesome
5,works seamlessly
3,Not quick reaction compare with another Microsoft mouse.
5,Perfect!
5,I wasn't sure if it would work well on a glass surface but it does. Using it well with an iMac.
2,the battery life  i use it for my Microsoft surface
4,I've been using a Microsoft Surface Mouse since I bought a Surface at the beginning of this school year and I firstly must thank the manufacturer of this mouse for not using shoddy switch for mouse clicking which seems to be plaguing the industry as of late.  No mis-clicks or faux double-clicking issues is a breath of fresh air.  But my one complaint is given that I travel on campus with this mouse in my bag inside a carrying case vibrations from movement causes the very slight far too easily pressed power button to engage.  Meaning I find it on taking it out of the case far too often which drains the battery faster.  This is an engineering problem with the button being not far enough inset or being not stiff enough to overcome the button depressing for the sake of power toggling.  This needs to be addressed.  I would happily re-rate this in the future as five stars provided a fix to this is made.  Otherwise though this is a great mobile bluetooth mouse.
2,The connection is not stable. I need to re-pair it with my laptop once in a couple days.
5,Great
2,Really liked it for about one month.  Then it wouldn't connect to Bluetooth.
1,It worked very well for about 9-10 months. Then it started to have problems with the left click. When I left-click sometimes it doesn't respond which makes it very difficult to use. I have changed the battery multiple times but it didn't help the issue. I've had some issues with it connecting to the Bluetooth as well.
1,Do you have big hands? If so this is not the mouse for you. It's one of the smallest mice I've used. It's not ergonomic at all and my hand cramped up after a few minutes. Bluetooth also dropped out every few minutes and I had to power cycle it to reconnect.
1,I thought buying the name brand product would ensure fewer problems than cheaper off-brand...This thing was messed up from day 1 and kept giving me grabby hand instead of pointer. I clicked around blindly in settings and it seemed fixed. But then lost connectivity and can't get it back on my computer. Trash...
2,I can not even use it because the chip was not in with the mouse.
1,I haven‚Äôt had it a week and it is already acting up. I have important documents needed for work and it is skipping and overall not cooperating with my excel sheet! I loved it at first but I don‚Äôt understand why it started acting crazy in 5 days!
2,This mice is smaller than what I expected it's not comfertable for people with big hands like me.
1,I expect more from a first party product.
1,It worked fine for 1 year. after that the mouse pointer flickers often even without me moving the mouse. Did not expect such a cheap quality from Microsoft. The price is also high.
1,It keeps disconnecting!
1,Short Battery life- lasted 3 months in ordinary use. Stated for "up to 1 year".  Simply not true.Initially great! but: Died in 4 months. stopped connecting despite new batteries
2,Connection is not very stable
1,This is the second time I have purchased this mouse. The first one lasted about 6 months before the Bluetooth connection stopped working and this one stopped connecting via Bluetooth in just over a month. I will not be buying again.
1,This mouse stopped working within 3 months...changed batteries reconnected on Bluetooth but in vain. Tried Microsoft support but their virtual assistant didn‚Äôt go too far and have been waiting on their support phone line forever now.
1,Took at least 20 minutes before I could get it connected and actually working. Then the next day I tried it again and it wouldn't work. After messing with it for 15 minutes I gave up and returned it.
1,This is a used product being labelled as a new product. Do not pay new price for this as you will not receive that. Product I received was previously used. Perhaps it was refurbished but it was not labelled as that either.
1,Every time I restart the laptop (Dell Latitude E7440) this mouse loses bt connection and has to be paired again. Tried it several times consistent result. Went through bluetooth settings and didn't find anything obvious to rectify this.
1,Paid for new. Received used mouse in a torn package. Unacceptable. I have asked for exchange. See what happens.
1,Bought this only for compatibility with my Surface Pro. NOT ergonomic and cheaply  made for the high price tag.
1,Wish I could return this mouse. It‚Äôs weirdly shaped and not ergonomic at all. It has a low profile which is fit for people with smaller hands.
1,Don‚Äôt buy and Amazon won‚Äôt return it
1,My mobile mouse says it is paired on my computer but it is not working at all...
1,Worked for about 1 week then died.
1,The mouse just no longer connected to my surface and would not reconnect after about 90 days.
1,I used it for one month it stopped working even if change new batteries Also Bluetooth connectivity was very worseIt only values $10
1,I have owned this mouse for 11 mos. and has stopped working.
1,Troubleshooting did not work I had to purchase another mouse.
1,Good while it lasted then died after product support had expired. VERY disappointed in this product
1,Package came damaged and outer shell of the mouse had a crack when I received it.
1,Mouse lost connection and cannot reconnect..Apparently it's broken...can I get a replace one?
4,At first took getting used too but now i really like the mouse lightweight and connects quickly
1,I received a previously opened item returned for refund
1,doesn't work with mac
1,Unbelievable It broke down after 4 months.
1,Stopped working after 3 months.
3,"Lightweight & portable"? -- Yes.  "Optimized for great scrolling"  -- OK.  "Dongle-free" -- Check.  "Works  on virtually any surface" -- Absolutely! 'Sculpted ergonomic design' --  Umm . . . what?This mouse performs so well at most of what Microsoft claims that many buyers - perhaps most - would be very pleased with it.  Its 4 1/2 star rating tells us that.Perhaps I'm unqualified to review this device. My hands are larger than average and its pancake-flat profile has practically prevented me from picking it up. If I can't maneuver it how could I possibly know enough about its capabilities?  Would my negative reaction be like 'dissing a pair of jeans just because I can't fit into them?Still - their marketing department either doesn't know what 'ergonomic' means or they think that lying is more or less equivalent to exaggerating.  The device's shape might look 'sculpted' but its lack of support for muscles in the entire hand (not just the lower part) would likely generate fatigue more rapidly than most mice.  Bragging about an otherwise great mouse having an 'ergonomic' quality when it can actually MAGNIFY stress on the  hand is unethical and - given its high ratings - probably unnecessary.
1,item no longer works would not recomend
1,It showed up broken.
4,This is a pretty good mouse. Very stylish and fashionable I can't lie it looks good with my current minimal desk set up. BUT you have to be willing to sacrifice fashion for comfort. You cannot wrap your hands around this mouse meaning you won't have a solid location to place your pinky without feeling a little goofy or having it drag across your desk. For some they won't mind but for me that's spends hours at my desk editing audio this is a problem. But that's my fault not Microsoft's. Only con I can think of is that when using this mouse without a mouse pad on my carbon fiber desk it sometimes misses input or is a bit jumpy. Oh and why can't I have a Burgundy mouse with a Black scroll wheel !!!!!!!
5,I couldn't tell the difference at first but there's one crucial difference. This "Surface" mouse broadcasts on 4.2 GHz whereas the "Modern Mobile Mouse" is 2.4 GHz. This mouse will be subject to less wireless interference. More still I am on a 5GHz wireless network and the mouse is still fine.I have large hands and as a musician am mindful of my posture. This is mouse is totally fine. It is larger than (longer and wider) than your typical wireless-usb travel/compact mouse from the like of Logitech etc.I am not a gamer whatsoever so I don't need split second accuracy to blast up space invaders or whatever. That said with business applications music applications watching videos and so on I experience zero lag. It also connects automatically without delay after i turn the computer on bring it up from sleep or after turning the mouse back on.I don't believe this mouse goes to 'sleep' on its own. You've got to press the power button on the back. Don't know how long the AAA (2) batteries will last but I imagine they will last a good long time. I've only had the mouse for the week. I forget to turn it off sometimes and I use it nonstop. Batteries still seem ok. It's not something I'm worried about.
4,Bought this as a travel mouse to use with Surface Pro. Wanted this specific mouse because of the flat profile -Pros:- Relatively compact- Good profile- Solid feel- Tracks well- Wheel is clickable- Easy bluetooth setupCons:- No back/forward buttons (my biggest complaint and the mouse would be almost perfect if it did)- Could use higher DPI.  I sometimes notice when I'm trying to be very precise it's not as responsive as I'd like and requires more small movements to get the pointer where I want itOther than those two cons it does what mice do and overall I'm happy with it.
4,Sometimes the device will not connect
5,I had my doubts initially but it‚Äôs an Amazing product. Works like a charm. Doesn‚Äôt take a million years to connect. Super easy to use and doesn‚Äôt hurt my hands to use either. Feels super comfortable too. It‚Äôs small and easy to store. And it makes a great clicking sound when you press down so you know you actually clicked. For 30 bucks it‚Äôs a steal.
5,This mouse has probably best battery life out there! I have been using it since november last year and the battery hasn't dropped a percent yet still at 100% 6 months in! The DPI is good. There is a small lag everytime the device is left idle and picked up to use i would probably like to configure that at the expense of battery life. My other mouse (surface mouse) doesn't have that pickup-stutter but the battery-life is significantly worse though.
3,I've owned two of these. On the first one the scroll wheel mechanism broke after about a year and it wasn't just a simple part replacement or realignment. It was BROKEN and I could only fix it if I soldered plastic together or something. On the second one the left click has started registering sometimes twice and sometimes not at all.As frustrating as it is it's a really nice and polished product that I don't WANT to give up. It's simple and everything feels nice and clean and responsive (before it goes defective anyway) and the magnets in the battery compartment work really well (though I guess the batteries are nigh impossible to remove once they're in there. It's possible but very very difficult)
5,Nice one
5,Super producto
5,Easy to use and set up.
5,Great product
2,Bought the Microsoft Surface Mouse & Keyboard. Looks really great for my liking. They work well for the first few months thereafter frequent bluetooth drops off. As of now mouse cannot be connected though battery still good.Batteries run low rather quickly but not a big issue if they actually work.Even with new batteries  bluetooth connection continues to drop off or none at all. Had also lots of problem contacting MS over their website for warranty repair so difficult it is prohibitive.Previously good email addresses ( a few ) no longer in use.Got to speak to a service staff eventually then language barrier and bad phone connection. Employee called back hoping for better phone line but bad connection persist . He did not call again.I feel like I paid for lemons and bad and none-existent after sales service.Sorely disappointing as I've been using Microsoft for many years software and hardware.I wish they work well as they are the only pair that got my attention from looking many other pieces even now.
5,Good quality easy to use
5,I DONT HAVE IT YET OR DO I.
1,Bought it in May 2021. Today is November 2021. Product disconnects every time. It disconnects when the laptop starts. It disconnects if it gets a tap whether it is a bump or a vertical tap.It is flat so there is nothing ergonomic about it.Not recommended.If you really want it get the 4 year warranty with it. You'll need it.
3,pros:- nice looking design that combines with surface pro long battery magnet battery seal sort of light weight.con:- the Bluetooth connection makes it feel sluggish takes some fractions of a second to respond to the movements and if you connect more Bluetooth devices it gets worse or the other devices dont work this is a deal breaker if you work on proffesional design work and have to do milimetric selection of vectors gets irritating no issue on long fast movements.- if you preffer small mouses and use mainly your finger tips to grip like me this mouse is uncomfortable
3,I love the function of the mouse but after having that just little over 7 months the left click button is worn out you have to click it several times to get it to click. I know its wore out because I switched the right and left clicks in the software and then it works using the right click as a left-click. If you buy this mouse make sure you buy the replacement insurance.
3,I needed a bluetooth mouse because my surface laptop only has a single usb port.  I got this mouse together with my lap top.  Set up is quick with bluetooth.  Unfortunately after using it for 30 minutes I realized that the aluminum scroll wheel is a little abrasive on my pointer finger.  I will be returning it for this reason and going back to logitech.
2,I bought this to use with my Surface Go but I regret spending the money.  I see nothing special about this mouse--the ergonomics aren't very good and it's not particularly good looking.  The main reason I dislike it however is that the on/off switch is an exposed button that is easily activated with any light touch or bump.  This isn't a problem if you use it at a desk all day but it you are "mobile" and hope to carry it around in your briefcase backpack purse or pocket you should expect that it will turn on all by itself when it bumps your power supply smart phone or any anything else it might come in contact with.Not only does this run the batteries down (mine are dead already after less than 1 hour of actual use) but when the mouse is unintentionally turned on the Bluetooth connection can activate your laptop or tablet running its battery down as well (plus it can overheat your device if it's packed up your carry case with little room to breath.As far as I'm concerned the on/off button is a flaw that disqualifies this mouse as a mobile device.
3,It is a very nice looking and working mouse - however if you have big hands it is not comfortable to use.
2,I've been using computers for over 40 years.  I believe this mouse would be at the bottom.  First of all it is NOT silver... more like putty.  The low profile may be appealing to some or many.  Other than that I see no distinguishing qualities.  I've used it since Sept 2019.  Fortunately I saw a programmable Logitech mouse on sale during the holidays and bought it.  That is what I am using as of today.  Bluetooth connection frequently a problem.  Today I saw a driver error.  I removed thinking I would be able to reinstall.  Windows 10 could not find it.  So it will go into the box of cables and stuff.  I've owned mostly Logitech mice and that will be what I do from now on.
2,Overall was pleased - high quality clicks slim and portable clean design (except for the forced MS logo). The issue is I'm having is with the scroll wheel. It's metal with slightly sharp edges and within a wheel of use my fingers are raw. Never happened with another mouse in 30+ years mice. If there's a replacement wheel that's rubber then I'd like to know because I'm to the point of having to give away this now otherwise unusable mouse.1 MONTH UPDATE:The scroll wheel jammed - now won't scroll downward.
2,I bought this mouse approximately one year ago from the Microsoft Store. It is slim and portable and I loved it in spite of the occasional unpairing that has been described by other shoppers.  Sadly a few days ago the scrolling wheel suddenly became loose while I was working. I had never had something like that happening to any mouse I have owned even the cheap ones.  For the hefty price of this mouse I certainly expected if not perfection at least several years of use. Very disappointed.
1,This is by far the worst mouse I've ever used. The ergonomics and build quality are awful and last time I checked mice were supposed to click. The left-click is literally always requiring multiple clicks to just register a click. Then when it finally does click it registers a double click and causes yet another step to what should be a simple click. It's become so frustrating to use .
1,Does not work anymore after three months... This is not my first microsoft mouse. I indeed have two. Both of them got broken after three months. I am not a heavy-user.
1,It looks nice but is way too loud I had to return it. If you work in a common space I do not recommend.
5,I really like this mouse because of its bluetooth connectivity. It was really easy to pair with my laptop and every time I turn it on it automatically connects and I can use it right away. I have limited slots on my laptop so it would be a hassle to have to take out my adapter along with a usb that would normally come with a regular bluetooth mouse. I like that the batteries are included so I was able to use it right away. This mouse is flatter than what I'm used to because I've been using mice that are more curvy but bulky. The flatness of it takes away the bulk which I think would be a good thing because it easily fits in my laptop case. It's something to get used to. The mouse itself isn't that ergonomic at least in my opinion because of it's flatness but it would be easy to take with me wherever I go because of the shape. The color also compliments my laptop pretty well. The clicks are quieter than my old mouse too which is really nice but I like the sound of the clicks it makes anyway. Another feature I find pretty nifty is the battery compartment door under the mouse. It's magnetic without a typical latch clip thing so I can easily open it without any struggle and it stays on quite well. I think my favorite thing is how well it works on many surfaces. I've tried it on my kitchen table desk bed couch and even on my leg and it works perfectly fine. Would definitely recommend.
5,This mouse doesn't disappointment it's small and compact and brings some much more life and use to your surface go makes it feel like a real laptop. Battery life is great and connectivity is strong.
4,I definitely recommend this if you are looking to replace the track-pad. The track pad may be convenient for simple things like browsing and reading but when you need to highlight or double click it can be irritating. This definitely is worth it to use when working or doing college assignments it is definitely ergonomic and very useful. The bluetooth connectivity for the Microsoft Surface Pro 7 picks it up without you needing to connect yourself. That was pretty great. I do recommend you buy a dark color the light grey tends to get dirty a little quick. But its definitely aesthetic and very great to handle.
5,This mouse is awesome. Slick Sheek Small perfect so so so nice I love it I am so glad I invested in Microsoft products. Microsoft has really stepped their game up and has continued to improve. The Microsoft Surface pro is amazing the pen to the pro is amazing and this mouse just completes it all! I love it.
5,Super easy to use  connects like it never disconnected. But it's hard to hold
5,Bluetooth works awesome! Connected on it's own and works on any surface
5,Perfect size and build. Sleek and slim enough to fit in any bag. Connects instantaneously to my Microsoft Surface book. Great purchase.
5,This works well and easy to use.
5,Very easy to set up Bluetooth.  Works well.
5,Very sleek design and works great.
5,Works flawlessly very impressed
5,wireless mouse and cheaper than bestbuy and microsoft.com
4,Easy to setup. Great battery life. Very portable.  Good quality.Overall i'm very happy with this purchase.
5,I have a Surface Pro and it was connected with one click. My wifes laptop a HP detected the mouse before I got it bluetoothed to mine.I have huge hands so it is a little small but perfect as a travel mouse. Only thing i dislike about it is that there is no on/off switch. It is simple tho to open the battery area and flip one of the AAA batteries around while traveling.
5,Slim no on-off switch always connected.
5,This is the one Product Microsoft does right. Feels great in the hand. Works on any surface smooth pointer flow. Smooth scrolling wheel very fine Resistance. Quiet click operation. Will buy again as gifts.
5,I was weary to buy it because it was much more expensive everywhere else I saw but to my surprise it was brand new and in Microsoft original packaging. Highly recommend this product
5,Works great! Much better than the touchpad on my laptop.
1,This thing Eats batteries (2 AAA).  It loses BT connectivity everyday.  not worth it
5,I bought it for my Microsoft surface tablet but I couldn't get it to connect with it. Instead it connects to my Dell laptop computer. The mouse I was using with my laptop computer work with my  Microsoft surface tablet.
5,This is a great affordable mouse with Bluetooth connectivity. No need for dongles and has great connectivity and response.
5,Easy to use great quality and worth the price!!
5,I like this - the clickiness has a nice feel it is sleek and small but comfortable ergonomically. Good buy and good value.
1,So frustrating! This is the second one I bought and they don‚Äôt work with with Dell laptops. The first one quit working but it was after the return date so I chalked it up to one bad one and ordered another because I loved the feel of it so much! Exact same thing happened‚Ä¶..after the return period it quit working. If I delete from Bluetooth devices and re-add it will connect and work again for a few hours and then just stop again. So ridiculous! I now can‚Äôt return either one and I have no mouse. Might work great with a Microsoft device but do not get it for Dell!!!
5,Bought as a travel mouse for my laptop and works better than my more expensive Logitech
5,This mouse is bluetooth and easy to use! It has a slim style and it us easy to put anywhere! I have been using mine for months and I love it! I have bought a pink and grey!!
5,I love the fact that I can sit in bed and use the mouse on my blanket... no need for a hard surface. The connection and response is great!
5,It's a nice slim mouse that I can pack into the small pocket of my messenget bag. Overall nice feel.
1,I have not installed it or tried it yet but the dimensions given on-line of 5.3x3.48x1.42 are the size of the box it comes in. The actual mouse measures 4-1/8" x 2-5/16" x 1". QUITE different. This mouse is a half inch shorter than the M510 I had planned to replace. And much more flat. Not sure if I am going to like something this much smaller. So note seller has posted the box size as the dimensions and that is really poor advertising.Just attempted trying it with my modern PC. Does not work. Obviously the PC does not have Bluetooth. Will try it on the laptop even though I do not want a mouse for the laptop.
5,I like it because it is relatively flat and easy to hold and navigate.
5,
5,it is really compatible to all my laptops
5,This mouse is worth every penny I‚Äôm a college stander who is always on the go so not having to worry about wires is great! This mouse is sleek and fits perfectly in my hand. Love it!
5,Like it due to low profile - I can slip it in the side pocket of my Surface sleeve
5,Quiet comfortable easy to pair
5,What more can I say. Beats any mouse Apple has ever manufactured.
5,Can‚Äôt complain!
5,This model of the mouse is easy to use and transport.  A press on a back circle (under the light) turns it on/off.  Highly recommend it if you are on the fence about the newer flat design.
5,Works great on my surface device
5,NOTHING
5,Great travel mouse. Small and flat makes it easy to fit in laptop bag.
5,J'ai re√ßu cette souris tr√®s rapidement. D√®s l'ouverture de la bo√Æte je commence √† l'aimer. Apr√®s un jour d'utilisation tout ce que je peux dire c'est que la souris est magnifique. Je l'adore. Tr√®s l√©g√®re facile et rapide √† installer et la qualit√© est super. Comme je viens juste de commencer √† l'utiliser je ne pourrais pas dire s'il va durer longtemps mais esp√©rons il continuera √† marcher apr√®s plusieurs ann√©es d'utilisation. Pourquoi je dit √ßa c'est parce que j'ai beaucoup de souris qui ont arr√™t√© de marcher apr√®s trois quatre ans d'utilisation. Le "look" est parfait le "click" du souris n'est pas fort alors j'aime √ßa. En sommes c'est une excellente souris de Microsoft je recommanderai fortement √† un(e) ami(e) et/ou √† un membre de ma famille. 5/5
5,Very good mouse. Quick bluetooth connect. Portable. Easy to setup. No problem after a 1-month use. Works well on different wooden desk surfaces. The rotating wheel is a bit rough for sensitive fingers but is sturdy and has great response.
5,Llego s√∫per r√°pido cumple con lo que promete muy c√≥modo ergon√≥mico preciso y ligero‚Ä¶
5,Works great connects quick and easy no setup required
5,Great for travelling
5,Se conecto con la surface de forma muy r√°pida ademas es muy preciso intente parearlo con una pc con sistema operativo ubuntu y no lo logre pero en la surface funciona perfecto. Los botones se siente muy bien y el bot√≥n de scroll es met√°lico y no de pl√°stico pintado el color se muy bien y tiene buen peso no se ciente pl√°stico barato muy recomendable
5,I didn't have this to long yet but it's nice and portable and works on our various glass tables which we have without a problem (didn't even expect that)  Paired it with my surface and other laptops with no problem.  I have really big hands and it still fits nice and don't have a problem with the size.  Couldn't tell you how long the battery lasts since I'm still on the stock for about 2 months or so.  Great range on it as well.
1,Lamentablemente no funciona como crei que lo haria. Esperaba poder usarlo sobre mi laptop o mi escritorio pero literalmente no sirve sobre cualquier otra superficie que no sea completamente lisa o tela. Como lo queria para usarlo en viajes pues entonces no me sirve de nada si ocupo cargar con un mousepad para poder usarlo.Honestamente esperaba algo mejor por el precio.
5,Se ajusta perfectamente a la mano es c√≥modo ligero y preciso.Funci√≥n en la mayor√≠a de las superficies exceptuando cristal.Las bater√≠as le duran bastante con un uso intensivo me han llegado a durar 6 meses.F√°cil de sincronizaci√≥n..el √∫nico pero es que despu√©s de 3 a√±os de uso constante la rueda termino rompi√©ndose pero solo la pegue y volvi√≥ a funcionar.
5,Cumpli√≥ perfectamente mis expectativas hab√≠a le√≠do quejas de que era muy peque√±o pero para mi que tengo manos grandes me result√≥ m√°s que aceptable lo √∫nico que no me fascina es que no tiene un bot√≥n para apagarse y por ejemplo para mi que lo tengo emparejado con la iPad y que lo traigo en mi mochila es algo molesto que se aparezca el puntero cuando muevo mi mochila a√∫n as√≠ es algo con lo que puedo lidiar sobre todo por su excelente duraci√≥n de la bater√≠a.
5,I love the microsoft bluetooth designer series.  Frees up a usb port and lasts quite a while.  Sadly I spend too much time at the computer and wear out the left click button ... This is my 3rd ... in less than 3 years.  Not many bluetooth available on the market so I continue to buy the microsoft.  IT DOES maintain good steady connection with the device.  Over the years it appears to be updates which cause the device to need to be repair'd.
5,El mouse es muy c√≥modo pero tiene algunos detalles de comunicaci√≥n con mi Surface Pro 3 cuando duras unos minutos sin usarlo se traba unos segundos para volver a funcionar. Por lo dem√°s en art√≠culo es de gran calidad.
5,After reading the answers and comments about I bought Microsoft's MCS-KGY-00001 mouse BUT it doesn't connect to my MacBook Pro. I tried some tutorials from the internet and had no success.Update: I was searching and I discovered that my MacBook isn't bluetooth 4.0 compatible - I will upgrade the board.
5,I love the appearance the design. It's very comfortable for my fairly small hand. I have an Acer laptop with Windows 10 I was able to pair the bluetooth in just couple seconds.I love love love this so far on my first day (April 20 2019).FYI: the sound of clicking is not crispy but rather dull and low pitchWill update this review if things go wrong.
5,I love this mouse. If you want a slick mouse that doesn‚Äôt cost double the amount and rhymes with schmapple this is your guy.For me it‚Äôs everyday use but I use it for precision as well with Adobe CC; Photoshop Illustrator and InDesign.Oh it‚Äôs lovely. The wheel feels very nice. I worry sometimes that I‚Äôm going to get it all marked up with fingerprints but so far (one month in) no prints or grime.I have the grey one. I only noticed recently there‚Äôs a red one! I wish I got that one it looks so good.Basically if you want a slick looking mouse that works well you should probably buy this mouse.
2,We really liked how ergonomic the mouse was but after using is for only a day it kept losing its connection to our Surface Pro. We decided to return the item rather than reinstalling it again and again. We have no idea why this happened.
5,Es todo lo que estaba buscando un mouse Bluetooth sin receptores y f√°cil de conectar. Solo tienes que prenderlo y Windows 10 lo detecta autom√°ticamente.No pesa nada no he tenido ning√∫n problema y el color es m√°s bonito en vivo que en fotos.
5,De los mejores mouse algo caro a mi parecer pero muy buena calidad las pilas son dos triple AAA pero duran mucho (meses) en uso normal lo mejor es que es bluetooth y se conecta directamente con la laptop o cel sin necesidad de receptor como otros. Me gustaria que la rueda sea del mismo color como la versi√≥n similar de mouse negro.
4,I like the look (cobalt blue) and feel of this mouse.  It works very well. No issues connecting to my Surface Go and it connects without lag everytime I turn it on. I am happy with my purchase overall.  The only issue is that there is no auto shutoff; you have to remember to turn it off manually (small button on the underside) to preserve the battery life.  I don't know how much drain leaving it on would cause though since I've only been using it a few weeks.  Maybe its minimal and not even an issue.  What do I know?  I'm not a mouse expert.  Still the idea of the little blue light perpetually aglow is maddening.  And there are inifinitely more things of worth to keep me awake at night other than concern over forgetting to power down my mouse.  Therefore my assessment is this: the day I get out of bed to check the state of the blue light is it the day it gets tossed.
5,Great mouse! I use it for my 2018 MacBook Pro it doesn‚Äôt take up much room in my bag either.I wish it had 2 more buttons on it for going forwards or backwards while browsing the web.Tip: Make sure you turn off the mouse when you‚Äôre done using it otherwise it‚Äôll stay on !! It doesn‚Äôt turn off after inactivity
5,De los mejores mouse que he probado. He tenido varios mouse en mi vida y  este me resulta de lo mas practico y sencillo para andarlos transportando a todos lados. Yo ya ten√≠a uno con anterioridad pero este se rompi√≥ la rueda y dej√≥ de funcionar tanto me gust√≥ que me compr√© otro igual. lo recomiendo ampliamente.
5,I like it is small accurate  I love the color and works well over all. The only inconvenience is about the design the bottom button that turns on the mouse is close to the surface so it turns on easily with the contact of anything in my backpack but is more about the design than other things
5,If you need a small light easily portable mouse this is a good choice.The caveat of a small mouse is that it doesn't fill one's hand as well and after a long day of work your mousing hand may feel fatigued.
4,It's an attractive-looking device with a simple yet somewhat elegant design that means it won't look out of place no matter what device you connect it to. The scroll wheel that sits between the two mouse buttons is metal giving it a sturdy and premium feel with tiny grooves in the surface for better responsiveness.
4,Like the fact this mouse compliments my Surface Book and connects directly with the SB without needing a USB transmitter so not necessary to have a different mouse for docked & undocked.Less love for the very low form factor which means that if you have large hands there isn‚Äôt a lot to grab hold of. However it still beats using the trackpad in any configuration.
3,The mouse looks great especially in this wine red color. It doesn't fit my hand although my palms are not large. The built quality and design are great. After I tried it I gave it to my wife and she loved. I would assume this mouse is for a smaller hand. It felt too flat for me so I eventually got something more ergonomic.
5,Great! I‚Äôve been using it for a month and it‚Äôs easy to connect to laptop and for now battery lasts..I switch it off when I don‚Äôt use it. In general looks like a good quality let‚Äôs see how it works later on
3,ACTUALIZO 10.09.2021 (Me gust√≥ la rapidez con la llego. El mouse es incre√≠blemente ligero se nota la calidad del material con el que microsoft hace sus productos este es mi segundo mouse de la marca el primero me duro 8 a√±os resisti√≥ cerca de 20 ca√≠das accidentales lo remplazo porque el bot√≥n primario ya no hacia clic buena durabilidad de las pilas y la calidad se nota desde el empaque.)--Actualizo mi opini√≥n despu√©s de casi un a√±o de uso encontr√© dos defecto y es la poca compatibilidad con mis equipos DELL y HP y adem√°s de una constante interrupci√≥n de la conexi√≥n a pesar de tener pilas bien cargadas y nuevas se desconecta as√≠ como as√≠ este modelo no lo recomiendo--
5,Realmene no necesitaba cambiar mi mouse pero dado que es BT me ayuda mucho a liberar puertos realmente combina con mi nueva Surface Laptop 3 ya que es plateado casi blanco dir√≠a yo la rueda de track es muy util y el peso es inigualable.
1,Beautiful design works great out of the box. It started to go off after 2 weeks and stopped working after 3 weeks. Replaced battery restarted bluetooth all of that nothing will make it work again. Surface Laptop2 cannot detect it any more though it detects the pen and other bluetooth devices fine.
4,Surface mouse does the job as described! I had to get another mouse for my PC since I am used to a magic mouse this surface mouse comes in handy for ergonomic purposes.
5,This mouse is quiet and comfortable and looks quite sleek. I have replaced the mouse I use for my surface laptop 2 with this one (instead of the surface arc mouse).
4,J‚Äôaime beaucoup cette souris. Elle est mince donc se glisse facilement dans mon sac pour √™tre transport√© mais avec un petit inconv√©nient d‚Äôergonimie car la paume de ma main n‚Äôappuie pas dessus comme sur ma souris pr√©c√©dente. Mais j‚Äôen suis tr√®s satisfais.
5,Had tried a few alternatives which constantly went to sleep or disconnected. This feels like a legitimate surface accessory and so far has worked flawlessly.
4,Buen mouse cumple con su funci√≥n muy √∫til para ambientes donde se requiere de mayor control al tener una Surface en modo potable sobre una mesa o escritorio.No es muy ergon√≥mico pero los botones son sorpresivamente c√≥modos. No lo recomiendo para uso extensivo pero para potabilidad creo que es muy buen dise√±o ocupa poco espacio.Azul Cobalto es el mejor color!
4,Excellente souris fonctionnement tout en douceur. Connexion USB sans faute. Prends peu de place. Il ne manque qu'un bouton "retour" pour remplir toutes mes exigences. √Ä noter que je ne suis pas un gamer et elle n'est pas adapt√©e pour ce type d'activit√©s.
1,Lo compre en Agosto a principios de octubre dejo de funcionar la rueda de desplazamiento llamo amazon me dicen que contacte al vendedor contacto al vendedor nunca responde los correos vuelvo a llamar a Amazon que llame a microsoft llamo a microsoft y me dicen que no tiene garant√≠a el rat√≥n en latinoamerica
4,This mouse is small yet ergonomic compared to other MS bluetooth mouse.  It fits well under my palm.Note: there is an on/off button (the same bluetooth scan button) but it is not mentioned in the instruction sheet.
5,Es muy preciso c√≥modo ligero y hegem√≥nico.Gran desempe√±o para trabajos en programas de arquitectura.
5,Estoy muy satisfecho con la compra. Este es un mouse de bajo costo muy pr√°ctico de gran calidad y que funciona excelentemente bien. Cero problemas. Muy recomendable.
5,El mejor mouse para el surface y otras laptops. Mi esposa tiene una Mac y le encanta este producto.
5,Muy buen producto ligero y elegante se conect√≥ muy r√°pido al Bluetooth de mi computadora con Windows 10. El √∫nico "pero" que le pondr√≠a es que los botones son un poco duros pero nada grave.
5,Used with a BT5.0 capable desktop card it will wake up and reconnect almost instantly. Very comfortable good tracking and long battery life. about 4-6 months with daily usage.
4,My hands are quite small the flat design makes it really comfortable for me to use. Should come with instructions to show how to turn unit off when not in use
5,Paired seamlessly.  No setup required.  Would recommend this mouse for surface users.  No USB or dongle required
5,Looks very nice color is superb. Works too my old MS mouse (exactly the same but black worked great as well the left click started double clicking after a few years.) hope this one last as long or longer.
1,Nice and elegant but the clicking sounds are too loud can hear them even with headphones on.Logitech mice are more silent.
5,C'est super! La batterie dure des mois si c'est pas des ann√©es. Fonctionnement facile et pr√©cis. Bouton subtile on/off.La meilleur souris sans fil qie j'ai achet√© √† vie.
5,Me gusta mucho es muy ligero es muy sencillo de instalar y funciona de lujo pero no muy recomendable para trabajo todo el d√≠a
5,La calidad del mouse es muy buena. Incluye bater√≠as AAA.A veces presion√≥ sin querer el bot√≥n derecho.La tapa de la bater√≠a se sostiene con imanes.
4,El dise√±o es bueno en general funciona bien aunque de repente se queda congelado el cursor cuando lo dejo de usar un rato pens√© que el clic era m√°s silencioso pero no lo es tanto.
3,The mouse itself functions fine but the mouse feels like a hollow shell of plastic which does not match the fantastic build quality of the surface laptop at all
3,The mouse is great however I have received a different color. I expected aluminum/ silver color but it was a matte grey.
4,No se como se apaga o quedar√° prendido y entrara en reposo? Si le quito las pilas se desvincula
5,Even works flawlessly on my wrinkled bed sheets while lazing around in bed.
2,I was under a good feeling when I purchased that mouse. Reviews were all very high.Forced to admit I do not share the same opinions on that one.The ergonomic in it self is kinda awkward not comfortable for real serious usage.Yes it looks good and its very lightweight indeed.Scroll wheel feels cheap skipping clicks sometimes non precise at best. In a world where there is so many other mouse options I can't understand that such a product even for that price range is that high rated.Industries have been building mouse for last 30 years and on this mouse I'm wondering if it's true. Maybe I wasn't lucky and I have a defect one ? Dunno. But for sure I can't recommend that mouse; I wouldn't want to buy another one.
5,Works great. Small enough to keep at the side of your carrying bag
5,This Microsoft mouse improve  the Surface Go experience by 100%. It's light and works on al surfaces connect  in a flash. Like all Microsoft accesories it is expensive for what it is but it works!
5,Me encanto f√°cil sin tener que usar adaptador trabaja en cualquier equipo de c√≥mputo con Bluetooth
5,Mouse was recognized immediately by Surface without any installation or fuss. Mouse is very responsive. Drag cut and paste and highlighting is very efficient. Excellent product!
5,works perfectly with my Surface Pro 2017. Very comfortable and ergonomic!
5,Esta hermoso ligero c√≥modo. Am√©
5,Excellent Bluetooth mouse.  Ergonomic and sturdy.  Feels great in the hand with excellent button control.
3,As Microsoft product is very elegant design but for me I wanted a designer oriented use. So I had to return it.
5,Perfecta compatibilidad con windowslo uso en mi surface go 2 se conecta de forma inmediata sin embargo no es precisamente c√≥modo bueno para unas cuantas horas de trabajo. Recomendado
5,El mouse es c√≥modo tiene muy buena precisi√≥n. El peso no hay problema aunque existen unos m√°s ligeros.  Funciona para cualquier computadora con Windows 10.
5,I love this small mouse. It is a perfect match to my surface pro6!
5,A very good mouse!

5,üôÇ
5,Comodo
5,Excellent produit.
5,Nice!
5,It is comfortable to hold and fits well within the palm. It looks sleek and attractive and the clicking is smooth. The silver scroll button looks good too. Batteries are included already. It works really well. No problems so far and it's been 2 months. It was delivered in perfect condition exactly as pictured. I would recommend!
5,MS this time  made a quality product so simple. I love this and 4 star for these reasons:1. Ultra sleek design.2. With my surface it woks flawlessly.3. I like the cobalt blue colour.4. Finishing is premium.5. Used BT technique is very good.Lastly I bought it from Amazon global store and it reached me a week before the scheduled date and the last star is for that. Amazon did really a good job.
4,Very good quality wireless Bluetooth mouse from Microsoft works in iOS macOS Windows. But everytime you need to connect when change operating system.
3,Unless to uninstall the driver  Blue screen starts coming .Later after you uninstall also it corrupts the OS .Solution is Windows 10 has to be reloaded almost 5hrs work.After windows is reloaded I  did not use this surface mouse for 10 days.And then once ensuring  Lap top is stable without virus.I started using the surface mouse .Within one hour  Blue screen and WHEA error.Now I have to scrap this costly mouse.Is there any solution from Microsoft.?
5,Very easy to use and setup. The design is perfect for long usage
5,The mouse connects to my HP without hassle. Works smooth. The clicks are easy on the hand and it can be used on any surface. Looks appealing as well.Glad I chose this.
5,Good Product Good Quality.
2,This product stopped working after 6 months the sensors do not work even if the mouse is connected to Bluetooth.The worst part is that there is no information about how to claim the warranty on this.Not expected this quality from Microsoft and seller.
5,Repeated the order for another comp. Can‚Äôt use any other mouse now.
5,Awesome mouse. Very easy to handle super smooth great ergonomic design. Loved it. Simply superb!!
5,Very good
5,Great product. I was at first hesitant of it being not original. Also there was no return just replacement but everything happens to be good with this mouse. I didn‚Äôt need any replacement.
5,Very usefull accessory to my microsoft surface pro.
1,Product is good but not in Metallic Silver as the  product picture shows. Product is comfortable and good looking but not at all "VALUE FOR MONEY". I bought it as I thought it would be in Metallic Silver (matching to my Laptop's color) but the real product came in plain grey color.02.07.2021 ::The mouse (this expensive) has stopped working since last 04 Months & there's no one in India from Microsoft who is even attempting to resolve the issue. Believe me the channel to reach Microsoft customer-care is so labyrinth & complex that even the most resolute person has to lay his sword down after many valiant attempts for bringing the matter to closure. Mouse is still under warranty. Tried and failed - running it on New Duracell Batteries also. The mouse is still dysfunctional and even the Amazon Customer care is helpless to provide any assistance.
5,A nice shape and very easy to setup and use. Battery life is excellent. Smooth responses.
5,Seems little high price product is super and handy
5,Best blutooth mouse @2935/-+ve*Good battery life*Smooth-ve*I don't know about warranty in India.
5,Very good quality product and user friendly
5,Awesome
5,Nice product... just pair with device and start to use.
5,100 percent beast mouse in the market
5,Best I have ever used.
5,Very comfortable
5,Absolutely made for each other
5,Like the design
5,It is good to use.
1,The mouse is pretty great as expected from Microsoft; however right after one year the mouse center scroll button stopped working it does scroll but it goes up and down (anywhere and not accurately where you want it to be.)I am unable to return the product and there is no information available on how to claim warranty.
5,I love it.
5,Superb finish and look
5,Good stuff
1,Blue tooth Mouse not discovered by the Surface pro Go it is not working at all it is expensive and very poor quality please don't buy microsoft blue tooth mouse
1,Do not buy electronic items from Amazon ! They just don't work !
1,Mouse is good. Seller sent a cheaper black model.
4,Excelente dise√±o detalles muy bien cuidados pero nada que ver el color de la publicaci√≥n con el producto f√≠sico solo tomar en cuenta eso al comprar.
5,El mejor mouse
1,I had to return it because it was uncomfortable using it after long hours and it was glitching I had to pay $14 to return it which is crazy
1,Purchased this MS Mouse from Amazon Canada November 22 2020.  It no longer works.  A few days ago there was a "POP" and the batteries were shot.  Put in new batteries the on light light flickers once and that's all folks.  Batteries are not short-circuited.Anyone know the warranty on this thing?Tom WoodsKingston ON Canada
5,Buen dise√±o practico para el d√≠a a d√≠a
5,Es muy f√°cil y c√≥modo de usar
5,J‚Äôutilise quotidiennement la souris pour le travail et elle r√©pond √† toutes les directives.
5,Parfaite
5,Excelente producto en ergonom√≠a sencillez y precisi√≥n
5,Es mucho mejor que un mouse generico por lo plano que es no es muy c√≥modo pero si muy pr√°ctico ya que lo puedes llevar en la bolsa del pantalon.
1,Purchased August 17 2021 died November 16 2021. The mouse has stopped going into pair mode and there doesn't seem to be a way to fix it. Not worth the price.
3,El precio es demasiado alto para lo que ofrece. Si lo compras en 800 pesos o menos esta bien. Tiene que usar bater√≠as triple A.Ya viene con bater√≠as y ese es su principal problema por ese precio puedes encontrar un modelo recargable .Su precisi√≥n es de regular a mala necesitas una superficie totalmente lisa.Se mancha f√°cilmente.Por un precio mayor de 1000 esta super mal de 600 o menos esta super bien.Esta super bonito un argumento super entupido para alguien que busca eficiencia. Pero si es bonito
4,La caja llego abierta y suciabpor dentro no se si compre un producto usado pero segun yo era nuevo. Funciona bien pero ojala no falle en el futuro cercano
5,Se ve muy profesional!
1,Liked it but didn't keep bluetooth memory!
5,It‚Äôs all in the title
5,F√°cil de usar se sincronizo de inmediato grandes acabados excelente producto
5,Muy buena atencion llego en tiempo y forma y la verdad el producto llego en su maximmo rendimiento
3,Esta fallando el scroll no se desliza y se va para arriba y para abajo les das muchas vueltas y no sube ni baja
5,comfort!
5,Excelente
5,Had it over a year now and working like new.
1,Since I bought it the device hasn't been working properly. Now it totally stopped; I changed the battery to no avail. It was a mistake to spend that much money on it.
5,Es muy preciso c√≥modo y muy f√°cil de utilizar.
5,Fast delivery and works very well.
4,Yes it's Microsoft and it can be a bit over-priced.However I think it compliments so well with the Microsoft Surface Pro.Purchased it as a gift for my friend and he's been loving it due to its slim design and comfort.Battery Life is still a bit debatable but a good mouse nonetheless.
5,Lleg√≥ en buenas condiciones y es muy c√≥modo para trabajar
5,Se conecto super facil v√≠a bluetooth con mi Surface el acabado es muy bueno y responde excelente al movimiento lo recomiendo.
5,Muy buen producto
5,Excelente precio y producto
5,Un excelente complemento para cualquier equipo y sobre todo para las Surface de Microsoft...
1,Do not expect this to last the scroller wheel started jumping less than a year after purchase.  Find another brand that will provide some sort of longevity.
