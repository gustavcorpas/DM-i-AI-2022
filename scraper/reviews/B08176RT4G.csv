5,Funcionan muy bien estÃ©ticamente son muy hermosas y tiene un RGB muy variable las recomiendo 100% ademÃ¡s que la conseguÃ­ a un buen precio
5,Please just check task manager if you're unsure it's running at the advertised speed. If it's not be aware you'll have to change some settings in bios! The led lights are bright as well! Very good product for modern PC's. (Sep. 2022)
5,Great memory paired with my 5800X3D CPU and MSI X570 Gaming motherboard. Lighting works perfectly with MSI Mystic Light so there was no need to download the G.Skill lighting App.
5,Pros: rgb=good fps boost amazing value for money...Cons: nothing
5,I bought on Prime day after a terrible first experience but this time it worked perfectly. Easy to install had no problems :)
5,Work great. First set I ordered one of them wouldn't light up swapped them through amazon for a new set and they work perfect.
5,Very proud quality! Exceptionally splendorous delivery. Immensely delightful packaging. Recommended.
5,Some of the ratings questions are tough to answer ease of installation? It's RAM it's all the same to install so if you think RAM is hard to install this will follow suit.Anyways its RAM you want to make sure you put the 2 sticks in the correct DIMMS usually alternating make sure then lock into place (and make sure you unlock the little tab before trying to slide these in)Its a good value to performance ratio and has the cool glowing RGB on top if that's your thing.There are faster options out there and there are cheaper options. But for what it is I think it's a quality RAM. I've had 2 of these installed in my gaming rig for I believe 3 years now with no issues and added another 2 when I purchased these.When buying RAM make sure its the correct DDR for your motherboard and find out what speed your rig supports. You'll want to use the same type/speed/size if you upgrade again so if you buy 2 sticks now you'll want to buy this same set in the future to have all 4 slots used.As far as RAM goes I mean it's a little tight fit next to each other with all 4 due to the heatshield/RGB but they fit just fine.If you put them in and then get any issues with your machine starting up make sure the sticks are pushed in all the way and the clips lock in place.If you try everything and still get issues return them sometimes RAM will be DOA and a bad RAM stick will make your pc not start up correctly.I did NOT have any of those issues just trying to be helpful these have worked great for me. And with modern computing using more and more RAM just for the OS and web browsing having an extra 16gb will certainly help.
5,Works as advertised in my i7-12700 / MSI Tomahawk combination. With XMP enabled I get 3600 CL18 speed reliably at 1.35 volts. I have used GSkill on most of my builds over the last 15 years and don't recall ever having a problem.  Buying two sticks of 16 GB made more sense but you get twice the light with four 8 GB sticks (lol). A package of four sticks is the safest bet but I've always had good luck using a pair of twos with one package per memory channel (mark each pair when you open package).
5,I mean its ram. It gets the job done.
5,Best budget Ram for gaming
5,RGB color matches with the motherboard. Works well with either AMD or Intel boards.  Makes gaming a breeze.
5,Great rgb Heavy built design
4,Son muy bonitas me funcionan super bien mi board soporta su velocidad de 3600mhz la uso con la placa aorus 450b pro wifi y el procesador amd ryzen 5 5600g sin tarjeta y un disco m.2 nvm2 de 500gb samsung y mi pc va super rapido...
5,I love them! I had 2 sticks like 1 year ago and decided to expand from 16GB to 32GB and they are working great! I recommend G-skill Sticks!
5,rgb
3,This RAM is definitely very sleek looking and pretty hefty feeling. Overall build quality and RGB are really good. This RAM works with a variety of different RGB software that you can install to tweak the pattern order colors and all that fun stuff. Now the bad part I purchased this RAM and ran it at 3600 mhz as advertised. This caused my system to reboot under heavy load so I had to lower the clock speed down to 3200 mhz. Now it runs perfectly fine with no issues. If you are in the market for 3600 mhz RAM and need it to run at that speed I recommend skipping this product and researching some other RAM modules. As far as gaming/general purpose use goes I would recommend the 3200 mhz version of this RAM and save a few dollars but that version probably has to be lowered to be stable as well. So this RAM is worth a shot if youâ€™re in it for the look but just be cautious could just be my sticks but Iâ€™ve seen similar reports on other reviews for this product.
5,I really like the look of this ram the only drawback is the software for the lighting affects. Not much to chose from. The price was lower than the corsair ram. Overall I'm very pleased with this product.
5,Haven't had any problems so far
5,The only brand of RAM I've used in my systems is G.Skill. Over the course of last year I had the urge to spice my rig up with some proper RGB lighting. I knew this RAM kit was popular and reliable so I went with them. Typical with any RAM swap it was quick and easy and everything worked instantly. On to the RGB strips on this kit they use a frosted diffuser which spreads the light very evenly. However something that I can't help but notice is the lack of brightness when set to a bright color such as white. Every other RGB item in my case nails the white color bright and very.. white. The LEDs on this kit however fail to match up to the brightness of my other hardware. Having an almost greyish-white and has a cold spot to top it off. So I settled with more forgiving colors that seem to blend much better syncing with Razer Chroma and using the fire effect for my Dark Souls bonfire theme.
5,Me agrada porque mi pc trabaja super rÃ¡pida y la utilizÃ³ para trabajar jugar y streaming.
4,Very good for gaming only bad thing is the colors are not spot on.
5,easy to install fast ram no complaints
5,Las rams funcionan perfectamente a 3600Mhz ademas son muy coloridas
5,10/10
4,So I recently bought 2 sets for quad channel and the GHz will only go as high as 2933 because I think the chips aren't quite the same so they don't like each other and they don't like over clocking ðŸ˜‚ they work just fine at 3600 GHz as just a dual channel but if your looking for quad go for the all in one not 2 sets.Other than that they work great RGB looks great and I would've been very happy but ye know sh#t happens
5,Overall a great product. Super easy install the metal plating feels sturdy and it works perfectly from what I can tell. My only problem is that the quality of the LEDs seems  spotty but it isn't super annoying unless you're trying to pay attention to it.
3,I ordered these  as an upgrade from some standard Corsair Vengeance 3200 MHz sticks.They were both picked up by my BIOS and were able to run XMP just fineâ€¦But one of them wasnâ€™t lighting up. Several hours later after immense frustration and exhausting all troubleshooting options I returned them to Amazon and am getting a replacement soon. I believe that the root cause of the issue is G.Skillâ€™s god awful lighting control software which does not play nicely with other similar software (Mystic Light for example). Apparently this can corrupt a stickâ€™s SPD. Soooâ€¦ buyer beware if using other types of software in tandem with G.Skillâ€™s. Could brick your RAMâ€™s LEDâ€™s! If this happens with the replacement then the review score will drop even further Iâ€™m afraid as the amount of frustration will have reached heights yet unseen by the human race LOL.
4,Could not get the speed above 3200mhz even though my cpu can allow up to 3600mhz speeds. Anything above 3200mhz would not allow my pc to boot into bios which was super odd and led to a bit of trouble shooting. Mb is a rog strix z390-I and cpu is a i5-8600k 6core at 3.6ghz but can oc to 4.0ghz... Overall the sticks rgb look amazing and maybe I've done something wrong or am misunderstanding. You will need to enable xmp and most likely will need to change the frequency of the ram manually like I needed to. Just want people to see this so they know they need to do more research and make sure their mb and cpu will work with the ram correctly.
5,They look freakin awesome in any build you can turn them just about any color or just off if you want and they preform great. What else do you need to know? If you catch them on sale they're such a good value. I put a spooky doll in my PC and they light her up really good :)
5,
5,Product was great! Great for gaming and really shines in games like warzone fortnite Minecraft and many more. Strongly recommend. Not to mention the RGB lights are amazing!
5,Son memorias muy rÃ¡pidas y bonitas estÃ©ticamente (RGB para mÃ¡s fps obviamente xD)
5,The memories look awesome in my new pc. Itâ€™s easy installation and you have to active the Xmp in your motherboard.
5,Has pretty bright rgb and is speedy enough for modern gaming.
5,I've never really considered RGB for a build before but somehow talked myself into trying it for my new setup and I gotta say I do love the Programmable colors. My previous build had mostly all red LED's that kinda faded over time and it's nice to be able to change the colors at will if I felt like it.I bought the 3600 Ram because people Recommended higher speed with the R5-3600 but on bootup my ram only ran at 2133 and attempts to change it to even 3200 result in the motherboard restarting back into safe mode to the bios so I've just left it for now but hopefully I'll be able to figure it all out at some point.
5,Over all I am OK with the RAM. It is controllable with ASUS Aura Sync but not with the G. Skill app. I think this is an ASUS issue though.Ensure this is the timings you want. I went from 3000 CL16 to these at 3600 CL18. Seems like the CL16's were snappier. Per Cenebench R20 the score did improve by 20 points. I suspect if I had gotten CL16 in the 3600 it would have jumped 40 points or more. Point is the price for CL16 vs CL18 is so close I regret getting this RAM.No issues so far though and very stable on stock voltages. I am not planning on OC'ing the RAM.
4,I installed the ram and if you are using the gskill software to control the ram light effects expect it to glitch a lot get stuck or just stop working and you will have to restart your computer several times or continuously uninstall/reinstall the program. It also works well with razer chroma but i find that half the time I am spending 5-10 mins trouble shooting half the time to get my ram working that i just leave it on a regular setting instead. Not a deal breaker but i have no such issue with my thermaltake fans as I do with these.
5,las compre para repotenciar mi pc actualmente la estoy usando con mi asus bf450f y corre a 3600 sin problemas estoy utilizando un amd x5800 espero ver como funciona con mi nueva asus ROG Crosshair VIII Formula si con esta camina de maravilla creo que sera mejor. soy de la vieja escuela y no me llamaba la atencion el tema del RGB estas memorias me han hecho cambiar de opinion es una maravilla como destella colores brillantes la placa base las reconoce de inmediato.
5,I liked the fact that it works on my system with no problem jus eish they were 16gb each.
5,Spectacular performance!
5,I have to say I was scared to use this on a customer build with Ryzen 5 3600 on a Tomahawk Max.I have to say I booted into windows updated to latest BIOS then Just THEN I changed to the advertised speeds of 3600mhz! No problem at all :) Played a few games (COD WZ Assetto Corsa iRacing) and everything was smooth and no crash at all.Didn't run Taiphoon to check if they are Samsung B Die or Hynix C (Either one should be good)
5,Originally I was having some trouble getting the advertised RAM speeds however after some research I found out why:In your computer BIOS there is a setting which will allow the RAM to perform at it's normal frequency without enabling this (It is disabled by default) you will only be getting a portion of its full capability. The setting is either called [XMP] or [DOCP] depending which motherboard brand you buy. I would highly recommend giving it some research if you are not getting the advertised speeds on your computer :)
2,As far as power goes goes these sticks definitely deliver. However the rgb on my sticks are really unpredictable. Most of the time they don't turn on without having to be reseated. When they do turn on I can't get them to be recognized by the g.skill lighting program  so customization is non-existent. Tried unistalling the sticks and trying both 24 and 13 configurations multiple times and tried Uninstalling and reinstalling the software everytime I reseated my sticks. Nada. Only reason they're still in my pc is because I don't have any other sticks to replace them. Next time I see a resented e on other sticks out they're gonna go.
5,Awesome rob ram fast 3600!!!
5,This ram went great with my build the rgb was easily controlled by asrock software works great for gaming if I end up needed my ram I will for sure buy again solid product.
5,I've bought two of these to have a total of 32gb of RAM in my pc and was ecstatic the second set ended up coming on the same day I ordered! Works great with my Ryzen 7 3700x
5,Compre desde chile muy buen producto sin problemas llego antes del tiempo estipulado excelente servicio
5,Works great I picked up about 40 more fps over the 3000mhz RAM I was using before. The RGB synced to the rest of my RGB components pretty much right away with no issues.
5,This RAM is also compatible with am4 motherboards. It works perfectly with my Asus tuf b550
5,With my i9-9900k 3600Mhz is ideal for its price to performance immediately showed up in my bios with the correct xmp profile and the rgb is great. With my aorus master software the ram colors are easy to change and I was kind of sad to see that the brightness modifier does not work might be a solution as I haven't looked very hard though.
5,Recently upgraded my rig and bought this set of RAM for the upgrade. They look amazing and perform extremely well with the paired 3600 CPU.
5,
5,Very decent very happy to this purchase.
5,Upon opening the package a group of gremlins came into the room and installed the ram for me and promptly jumped out of the window
5,decent value for what it is.
4,Work nicely love the colors unfortunately couldn't get the advertised speeds but that's not always a guarantee from my understanding from several YouTube resources so at least it worked and nothing was Dead on arrival
5,At first I was dissapointed I couldn't get the clock speeds and then I looked at my motherboard manual and had them in the wrong spaced slots. As soon as I switched them it fixed the issue and I now have them running at 3600mhz
5,Finish your install of windows then enable XMP bam. Used these on my sons Gaming PC now I need another set to use up the available spots. No errors no hiccups. Paired with Ryzen 5 3600 MSI Tomahawk Max.
5,the ram was really easy to install and works well on my computer I would recommend getting this brand of ram sticks
5,Excellent product would by more but this was plenty. Rgb looks good.
5,Perfect size rgb seems to just work with all the motherboards Iâ€™ve used
5,Great rgb colors. Very bright. Nice timing speeds. Good value.fits perfect.
1,Not sure if it was Amazon's fault or manufacturer but I ordered 3600 mhz and got sent 2133 mhz. Obviously this is a huge downgrade in performance from what I ordered so I had to send it back. Please check your frequency to make sure it's as advertised when you install this. Will update review if manufactured manages to remedy my problem by sending me what I originally orderedEdit: Tried to contact manufacturer with no dedicated support options on the website it's hard to but I managed to contact some "site wizard." Well I never heard back from them. Weird to buy what is supposed to be "high end ram" and the company that sells it refuses to remediate issues with their own products. Avoid at all costs and choose among many other safer vendors that can assure product quality.
5,This was for my son
5,Perfection.Love the looks and metallic framing.
5,Super fast !! Make sure if using AMD board to disable restrictions on bios to get full 3600mhz
5,Love the rgb and it functions just fine with no problems.
5,Exclusivo
5,Was greqt but disnt run at 3600 since i has a amd setup but works reql good at 3400
5,Excellent for first build. Paired with Ryzen 3600. RGB lighting is fantastic and visually appealing.
3,Software seriously sucks but itâ€™s very beautiful in a build.
5,fÃ¡cil de instalar
5,Works fantastic looks fantastic.
5,works great. Both sticks run at the correct speed.
3,The Ram is not tuning up to 3600 my motherboard was able to run Corsair at 3600 but these seem to peak at 3200 not what I expected and to top it off prime next day shipping took 5 days to get to me.
1,shortly after installing the RAM I started getting BSOD tried diagnosing for some time finally ran Memtest and my RAM failed I replaced it with some very cheap ram and no more BSOD. Very disappointed as the return window has closed this is in no way the seller's fault I want to add that. this is on G-Skill who has been non-responsive
5,They ran at 3600 out of the box and are stable OCâ€™d.
5,Great ram and the fact that it's RGB is just a bonus...
5,Works fines with no problems
5,Great Ram Great Price
5,Son fantÃ¡sticas
2,It said ddr4-3600. I THOUGHT IT'S 3600MHZ but NOOOOO. IT'S ONLY 2133mhz ( I showed on pic ).. Be carefull.
1,I purchased 3600 speed and was sent 3200 speed maybe not a horrible product but just a horrible reseller of this product.
1,I purchased the 3600MHz sticks only to find that they consistently crash instantly at that speed and have had to run at 3400MHz instead to boot in. So buyer beware you may not get the advertised clock speed in full.
1,I tried to install it a million times to no avail!
5,I have 2 sticks of this set of ram in my pc... The lighting software is a absolute b**** to control but they still look really good. Warning though the metal is very sharp my ram sticks have a bloodstain on them from when I was putting them in...
5,Worked great.  Fit was perfect!
5,Fantastic RGB! Fast enough for my ryzen 7 3800xt
5,Excelente
5,Si las quieres adelante 10/10 te dan lo que compras ni mas ni menos.
5,This is the best quality RAM for this price point. I have not seen any other RAM with RGB that looks even slightly good and at this class for the same or less. I love this RAM
5,They're simply the best and you cannot change my mind. The speed is great the RGB completely brilliant and the aggresive shape is flawlessly executed!
5,Great product
5,Perfect performance for this price.
5,Excelente memoria
5,Son eficientes y elegantes
5,It's colorful and it's ram what else is there to say
5,Works well don't care to much for the trident software that controls the rgb uses more then it should of the cpu.  Works well as ram pretty to look at.
5,thanks
5,thanks
5,El RGB destaca por sobre lo demÃ¡s aunque es un poco limitado en tanto a colores
5,What can I say besides that itâ€™s ram and it has RGB? Itâ€™s XMP ready. Itâ€™s not the highest capacity DIMMsbut you donâ€™t need more than 16GB for gaming nowadays.
5,Had a little issue installing because I had to push really hard.  Ram made my pc rn smooth as slicing butter with a red hot knife. Huge improvement well worth the price!
5,me llego rapido y seguro hermosas memorias con aura sinc
5,Fantastic product - they look amazing and perform perfectly
5,Made my first pc ever and this one where not only good price but they good too 100 percent recommended.
5,I upgraded my old ram (8x2 3000Mhz CL 18) to these G.Skill Trident Z (8x4 3400Mhz CL15)By far a much better experience especially for an indie game developer who dabbles in Clip Studio Unreal Engine and Video editing.  Rendering scenes are much faster as well as previewing with room to spare.For gaming I didn't notice a difference at all honestly but for Streaming that is a whole different story.  I noticed much less hitching or frame drops and my viewers both public and private are given the best experience in comparison.I most certainly recommend this product if you can find it on a reasonable sale be it on Amazon or Brick and Mortor store you won't be disappointed.  Big note for inexperienced people in the PC building/ upgrading world.  Make sure your Motherboard can handle the size and ram speed.  My motherboard's max size limit is 64 GB but I didn't need the extra 32 GB.
5,Rgb looks very good and is easy to customize. 16 gb at 3600 speed is more than enough for anything you want to do. Overall great product. This is a good buy for your system.
5,Good Ram for a good price
5,Good speedy ram!
5,tridentz ram. Beautiful and nice rgb
5,No need to write much.Set as described works fine.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                Â Really good deal if you find this g skill 16 gb (8Ã—2 GB Ram) DDR4 3600Mhz at around 7kDDR5 Is still expensive so i think it's perfect choice
5,These worked very well for my grandson
5,Good rgb light sync with Msi RGB system easy to install and setup
5,G. Skill absolute banging product. It cames from california so not very fast delivery (12 days) but it worth the wait and the money. Amazing and absolute recommended.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                Â The price could have been a lot better for this 16gb cl18 kit of Trident Z rgb but it makes up  for it with that 1-day delivery
5,Ordered from USA to UK and was delivered much earlier
3,Good and happy with the purchase
1,the ram was the main reason why i couldnt get any signal on my monitor used another ram from a different brand worked completely fine. used this ram showed no signal
5,Good RGB RAM with 3600 Mhz
1,Very clearly used... pins were corroded heatsinks were covered in dirt and gouges. The pictures don't do the damage justice. The box was clearly resealed too. This is a scam product! Do not buy!
