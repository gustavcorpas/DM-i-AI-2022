4,Love how it grips to the phone
5,I absolutely LOVE this detachable pop socket! It‚Äôs nice looking and I like that when I don‚Äôt want the pop socket I can just detach it.
5,I was getting arm and wrist cramps from using my phone. This is so helpful to relieve the tension!
5,I have a dark blue phone with a dark blue case and this pop socket looks beautiful with the blue. It also holds very well while still being fairly easy to remove for charging with my MagSafe car charger/holder. My phone goes into a pocket easily thanks to the slight recess in the design. Very happy with this purchase.
5,Sturdy. Looks nice. Easy to get on and off.
4,I've tried to look for other off brand magnetic pop sockets due to the price. I would say the price is a bit steep. Considering there aren't many off brand pop sockets out there on the market this deserve 5 stars. I am only giving 4 stars due to the pricing. Something like this should not cost this much ever. Besides that you will be satisfied with the magnetic base. It's easily taken off by the hand the magnet is extremely strong. My phone hasn't fallen out due to the magnet like others. I would highly recommend.
5,I love changing cases weekly. I am obsessed with pop sockets I cannot handle a phone without a pop socket it was the best thing they came up with but since I changed cases so much I spent hundred of dollars buying a pop socket for each case until this one came out. I can change cases as often as I want and I can use the mag safe for charging. Its super strong and holds the phone very tight 100% recommend!!
5,This is a fabulous popsocket
5,I was so reluctant to get a magsafe case because I didn't want to lose my pop socket. This is the greatest invention ever. A magnetic pop socket that can be removed to easily charge your phone using your magsafe. So easy to use. This truly made me so happy. Very much worth the money.
5,I love the MagSafe pop sockets so much. I love the ability to just remove it whenever especially for wireless charging.You do need a MagSafe compatible phone case which adds an extra magnetic layer for a stronger connection.
5,Got for wife. We were scared it would come off when you dont want it to but been using a month now and sticks pretty strong never had an issue. And pops off when charging at night.
5,Ive had this for a while now. The magnet seems  to get weaker over time. Still holds I just have to be more careful that it doesn‚Äôt pop off during too much motion. I also had the removable one that expands over the sides of the phone and this one is sooo much better. I bought a bumper so I can I tercia get my socket and apple battery pack.
5,I was skeptical but it‚Äôs been holding!
5,Love it!! Stays on well but able to slide off without damaging the case!!! So easy!
5,Works as expected.
5,This is a wonderful product. I love how you may switch back and forth with just a snap. I‚Äôm very pleased. Two thumbs up approved.üëçüëç
4,I have a clear MagSafe case from apple for my iPhone 13 pro max. This connects very securely to my case and makes it a lot more comfortable to hold my big phone. I wish it came in some less bold colors but the gold and white marble is okay. I also thought the pattern would be metallic and the gold would be reflective but it‚Äôs not. Overall I still like it and use it every day.
4,Solid magnetic connection! Pretty. But pop socket is for very tiny fingers works okay as a stand sideways only though.
4,So this thing is exactly what I was looking for- a removable pop socket magnet. While I love it and use it all day every day the magnet needs to be just a touch stronger. When it gets knocked it separates and the phone goes flying. Make sure you have a GOOD phone case and screen protector. It is a nice concept and I love being able to pop it off to use my car phone magnet holder.
5,I love the satisfying snap this makes when it jumps on to your phone. You come close and the magnet pulls it right on. It stays secure. You can take it off fairly easily but it doesn‚Äôt fall off. It‚Äôs well made and feels really good in your hand. Smooth but not slick. I have the marble/gold looking one and the colors run through not on top of the plastic.
5,For use with specific MagSafe phone cases.Decided to get an apple MagSafe case and got this pop socket in the gold marble color to go with it. I really like the marble design it looks better in real life there‚Äôs a lot of depth to it. Most importantly it sticks great to my case! It hasn‚Äôt come off at any angle and has stayed on even when I move my phone around yet when I wanted to take it off I was able to with no issues. So if you have a MagSafe case this is definitely a quality product.
5,Had ‚Äòpop sockets‚Äô imitations before that were bulkier the tops came off at the slightest tug. Just buy from the original. 100% compatible  with MagSafe case and quality material. Strong hold but easier enough to remove for MagSafe charging. Would like a little more color variety. But other than that very pleased
3,I bought this Popsocket after the original one that I had didn't work well with my new MagSafe phonecase.  I have the iPhone 13 pro max and wish that the Popsocket was able to be moved to the bottom as the phone is too large to be able to realistically hold the Popsocket and reach the entire phone.  I think it would be nice to be able to slide the Popsocket component into a position that's most comfortable for the user.  Other than that feedback it has a very strong hold on the phone and I don't fear dropping or losing it at all.  A bit expensive but what other alternative is there?
3,I really liked the idea behind this pop socket. When it arrived I thought it looked nice and seemed sturdy enough. My biggest complaint is that the magnetism could be better. If you try to pull the pop socket out the entire piece comes off your phone unless you hold the base down while pulling the socket out. My 8-year old son has dropped my phone several times when trying to hold it by only the pop socket. If he‚Äôs not also holding the actual phone it will often times fall from the pop socket to the floor. I actually wanted to return this and get something else but I haven‚Äôt found a good alternative yet.
5,The magnet could be stronger. Otherwise great product. Design came as expected and very comfortable.
5,I had to return a few other ‚Äúmagsafe‚Äù products because they did not hold. This does  the job!
5,Does its job. Would get again.
4,If magnets were a little stronger they could take better advantage of the MagSafe system. Falls off a little too easy but only in certain circumstances
5,I doubted the strength at first but quickly realized how solid this adheres to my Zagg case.  Love the flexibility of removing if I need to slip my phone into a small wallet or slim pocket.
4,It‚Äôs magnetic. Doesn‚Äôt stick on solidly. So it ends up flopping off with too much weight of the hand. Super cute but not super practical.
3,Magnet is not strong enough to allow holding an iPhone 13 pro max phone by the grip. I used this over a thin silicone case and even without a case with the same poor result. Waste of money.
5,Very heavy duty and stable. Love it!!
5,Obviously you should be careful to secure it properly and not carry it by the pop socket but if used according to directions it works perfectly! Much needed for the bigger phones.
5,Love love LOVE this pop socket. The magnet is super strong and I love that it is made specifically for MagSafe. A little pricey but what do you expect for a MagSafe specific product haha. Buy this!!
2,Bought 3 different items with the hope that one would be useful‚Ä¶NOPE! None adhere adequately to my MagSafe case & I now have a cracked screen.  So disappointed & dissatisfied!
3,Not as good as the other pop sockets.  Takes up most of the phone.
2,The idea is great but the magnet is not strong enough. I can‚Äôt even open the pop without it coming off of my case. I do have a MagSafe case and followed all instructions. Disappointed for the price. Regular pop sockets have a much stronger hold
2,The amount of times I have dropped my phone on my face because of this is unreal. You‚Äôd think I‚Äôd learn. Also very hard to grip because of the size of the adhesion magnet. Even laying on your side in bed is difficult because the phone doesn‚Äôt stay connected.
1,I love my popper. I have holders everywhere. But this is not comparable. It doors not adhere in any way. gave away my mag charger so I could go back to my old sturdy popper.
1,Just opened and popped it and the entire thing came off?? I was so excited about this.
1,Doesn‚Äôt work without their case making total investment $80 so no thanks will be returning
1,Do NOT buy! Does not stick at all. Worthless magnet!!!!!
1,Not strong enough to stay on iPhone13 pro max without a case on.
1,The magnet is not strong enough.  It detaches everytime I change the volume.
5,The adhesive ring is not as strong as the magnetic pop socket. It keeps slipping and sliding and it seems it wasn‚Äôt made for taking off and putting the pop socket off and on. I charge my phone by wireless charger. A strong hold but the magnetic circle/ring needs improving.
3,Not what I had expected did not last long at all. With the magnet it broke and pulled apart within only a few weeks of having . Had to return.
5,Very nice product.
5,Works as I expected.
5,I have Iphone 13 Pro Max and ordered this for better grip because the phone is quite heavy. It‚Äôs worth it. Great adhesion using original Magsafe clear case. And the design suits the gold color of my phone. I use it for better grip as a stand and easier selfies.
5,This is a great pop socket. The magnet is strong (I use it with a MagSafe case).
1,I was waiting so long to be disappointed later you cannot stand your phone with this it falls all the time
5,I purchased this for my iPhone 13 Pro Max and within 48 hours it kept sliding to the right.  Given the instructions I always clasp the sides of my phone when attached.  However I cleaned my apple MagSafe case to ensure that it did not contain anything that prevented the magnetic field to contact.  It did but it wasn‚Äôt as strong as it was out of the packaging.  I continued to adjust to see if there was an exact spot. Needless to say that I‚Äôm convinced that mine was faulty even though the pop socket portion never detached from the plate.One week it lasted.  Last night I pulled my phone out of my hoodie pocket and this was no longer attached.  I have no idea where it fell within 2 hours prior.  For this reason I will try a different company.  I can‚Äôt trust this given the cost of a 13Pro Max
5,This is easy to put on and remove but DOES NOT MOVE once it‚Äôs on. Do not hesitate. Buy it now. Makes mag safe charging so easy.
5,I love the fact that it‚Äôs sturdy and has a very strong grip but I don‚Äôt have to ‚Äúcommit‚Äù to keeping it on and I can swap other MagSafe accessories whenever I want. I hope they come up with more of these.
5,Magnets hold firm and strong. Kinda wish it was a gloss finish instead of matte or that the gold was Reflective/metallic. But overall does what it needs to do and looks nice.
5,Works very well with an Apple clear case for iPhone 13 pro. Does not work with an otterbox that claimed to be MagSafe compatible. It‚Äôs great to have a removable thing to use with MagSafe charger. I also have a car holder that is MagSafe so can use that too.
5,Great
5,This MagSafe pop socket worked great! I had it for 2 weeks then I lost it! Because I had to remove at each time I place into my cellphone car holder I believe it fell out other car (I had in my lap while driving). The only issue for me was the cost. So I‚Äôm just purchasing a regular pop socket. Can‚Äôt afford to lose another.
5,I‚Äôve been using this for a bit over a month and it‚Äôs been great. Note that you do need a MagSafe case if you want to use it with a case. I like that the magnet part is thin and doesnt add to the thickness of my already thick iPhone 13 pro. The actually pop socket position is a bit high I wish it was a bit lower. I think perhaps the positioning is more suitable for the iPhone 12 or 13 mini. Other than that I think this is the best MagSafe accessory if you want the flexibility to swap out styles or easy remove the accessory to allow for MagSafe charging.
5,Got for my wife's phone and despite some concern over a magnetic pop-socket there was nothing to worry about.  The magnet is powerful and will not let go until you decide to pull it off which surprisingly isn't hard at all.  Well built good quality and worth the cost.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†I don‚Äôt like popsocket phone cases because they aren‚Äôt something I want on all the time due to the inability to use my car mount and put in my pocket. I just bought the iPhone 13 pro in gold and decided to explore MagSafe cases and accessories. I have to say I absolutely love the versatility! This popsocket has a strong magnet but can easily removed when you get your nails under it just right. It doesn‚Äôt damage the case but there is no way this thing is coming off unintentionally. You could keep it on if you prefer but it does kind of defeat the purpose. The marbled look is gorgeous and it is really comfortable for my little hands and fingers. I highly recommend this PopSocket!Note: You cannot use the magnetic wireless charger with this on! No problem though you can just pull it off if you like charging your phone that way.
4,I really like this product super easy to apply and remove. My only complaint is the price. However the sticky pop sockets lose their stickiness so maybe this will end up better value long term. Time shall tell!
4,Very strong magnet. Especially if you compare to the anker magsafe ring. This popsocket magsafe just works. Only reason it does not get 5 stas is because the back of the pocket which sticks to the phone is thicker than the normal popsockets base so u get slightly less space for your finger when using. So if u have thick fingers you may find it less comfortable than using the normal popsockets.
5,Prodotto molto buono stabilit√† ottima l‚Äôunica cosa che la presa dietro √® un po‚Äô morbida
5,La verdad que despu√©s de usar miles de gadgets que no son de apple este se lleva la Palma. Se queda perfectamente adherido y no se mueve nada. S√∫per contenta con la compra
5,I‚Äôve had pop sockets for a few years now and this one is amazing. I‚Äôve always been worried with the adhesive ones in case they came off. But this feels so solid! Fab design.
1,This doesn‚Äôt come with the pop top it is just a magnetic bracket. What a waste of money
5,Got as a gift. It ended up being way more useful than I thought now I don't think I can use any phone without one.
5,Grip is strong for regular use. Easy to remove and place it back
