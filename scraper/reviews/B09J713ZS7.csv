5,Bought for our trip to Central America.  Took it zip lining and white water rafting.  Has held up very nice.  Lots of fun being able to take photos and videos under water as well.  Just wish the battery lasted a little longer.  Have not ran out of power yet but saw how it was running down and managed the time we used it.  If I were to have left it running on the rafting trip it would have ran out of battery.  Recommend back ups if you plan on leaving it running for an extended amount of time.
5,Unit was as advertised.  Quicker than anticipated shipping.  Wouldn’t hesitate to purchase from this seller again!
4,i love it thanks Gopro
5,I use this on motorcycle helmets and go carts.  Shoots super smooth and plenty of options. Only downside is how poorly the GoPro Quick software works... Simply awful when trying to upload as it should.
5,This camera is durable and lives up to the name “waterproof.” I put it under a 60 ft. waterfall for at least 3 complete minutes of direct impact. My monopod almost got knocked out of my hand from the current but this GoPro kept doing it’s job. It’s one tough little camera. The stabilization is what makes each video great. I’ve purchased knock-off brands that don’t offer that and their videos will make you motion sick.The image quality is also great. As you can see in these pictures from my videos I saw several fish and even an eastern hellbender which is rare (not pictured). Previously I had used my phone in a waterproof case and the quality was good but not superior like the GoPro.This GoPro is my new favorite camera without question.
5,I have video of fish swimming around my feet in the Cayman isles. This thing does great under water and above water. I like that I can just tell it to start recording or take a picture using my voice. I have not yet bought a spare battery for it. I have not needed one.
5,I bought this for vacation at South Padre.  I had read some people's reviews about it leaking so I bought a waterproof case to go with it (as well as a wrist and hand mount).  I used the waterproof case during the times that I knew it would be submerged under water (in the ocean at the waterpark).  I did not use the case for times where it might just get splashed (parasailing etc).  Overall I had no issues.  Battery life isn't the best but that is the standard complaint among all of these type of cameras so I bought extra batteries.  The battery/memory card compartment is difficult to open but that is expected if you want a waterproof seal.  It is much simpler to use than my GoPro 4.
5,great product. I purchased this for a Florida trip and it didn't disappoint. great photos and videos. I did get a few extra batteries which came in really handy
4,I've had the GoPro and the GoPro Quik app for a bit. The online services are okay but not spectacular. App has performance issues crashes a lot and isn't the best UI. However it is convenient to just plug this sucker in at night and thumb through the vids on my phone. Haven't tried the live streaming function yet but if thats great I may update to 5 stars. The actual camera has good video quality easy to use. The still photography is meh. I ordered a macro lens to see if I could fix that up a bit. Regardless its good tech. The beeping annoys my wife.
1,Call from Go Pro  regarding case number 11347335After having me on the phone for 12 hours over three days and blaming the cables the sd card my cat etc and having me purchase more new 'approved ' products they came out and said. " TO BE HONEST THIS CAMERA IS CALLED A 9 BUT USES THE 8 PLATFORM AND WILL NOT EVER CONNECT TO A PC TO BE USED FOR VLOGGING  ZOOM  ETC. and thousands have called to complain.Go Pro has zero customer service. Call the number Amazon gives you and it refers you to the website. Log in for a chat or a call back and it says 5 minute or 10 minute wait times. It has been 8 hrs at work with the with you soon chat window open.Support forum has Go Pro Employees who ask the same stupid questions. What OS... What environment and no matter how many time you answer the same nonsense.In the end it over heats in 26 degree weather  the web cam software is based on a Windows 98SE format that gives you "the usb device you connected is not functioning"  the battery lasts 8-12 minutes under use and two associates have said this is normal.Do you remember those Coleco Games from the 70s? The ones that ate batteries one after the other?Well the Go Pro is exactly like that. It burns through its battery in 8-12 minutes. Why give it the capacity to hold 256 and 512 gig cards if the most you can record is video shorter than most Youtube commercials. Add a HOT light and your battery is more or less worthless.Software does not work with PC and Windows. If you own a high end Microsoft Surface Book or Desktop FORGET editing your videos with QUIK.Accessories that don't work with each other. So since the software doesn't work with computers used for editing you can not directly access the videos you created. SO you have to disassemble the unit...off with the light off with the mic contraption to get to your sim to bring you videos to an editor that is meant for professionals. This camera is not meant for professionals and despite the claim you can vlog with it...... you can if you assemble disassemble record in 8-12 minute vignettes and spend your time on TIk TOk.Additionally plugging it in with the NON existent cable - the one they give you expects you to set up your camera with 5.5" of your computer so forget mounting it. without extra $$$. It also gets waaaaaaaay HOT . when plugged in and connected for an hour.....Speaking of mounting the mounts they give you do not include anything to attach to a vertical tripod  but if I wanted to vlog in 8-12 minute videos with it attached to my head I can.Speaking of mounting they do give you a screw assembly with an adhesive stick on. IT does not stick to anything. For $323 plus accessories card and the cables they don't give you you would think they could at least give you some glue that isn't from the 3 stooges glue factory. I will post the video of this horrible little product. Sort of like shelling out for  a Mercedes and finding out the wheels are bald.In the end this is an over hyped useless product that dies quickly.My nephew however was all too glad to accept this as a gift and I used gorrila glue instead of GO PRO 3 Stooges adhesive to stick it on his helmet. Now he looks like the goon from slingblade with $600 of junk. (He will buy the extra batteries)
4,Great camera but touch screen response is poor.
2,I'm so disappointed with go pro. What is happening with that brand !? I used to have version 3 for so many years but had to replace as it died after water leaked into the housing.I went with that hero9 after reading quite a lot of reviews. So I knew I could not expect running it full speed full definition in a diving housing and therefor turned it down. And still this camera really works when it decide to. Batterie is really not lasting and you have to place it into the camera at the last minute or it will drain event before using it. So many recorsing failed on the sd card (4k rated high quality card that works just fine with my 360 camera). You think it is recording... Well it is not!And even when it it recording you have to make sure the lense protector is dry amd clean or you will end up with a blury image. (I know the next version claim it's fixed but really.... At this price tag....)I purchased that camera going for a long waited scuba diving trip to bora bora and ended with so many missed recording of unique moments that I will probably stay away from gopro brand going forward until they fix their engineering.Unless you are planing to use it for a short dry moving action don't buy!Won't work for for most of the situations where you want to start the recording and enjoy the moment knowing it will be on tape.Just an other side note on software bad design. The app is expecting you upload your videos on their cloud.... Well good luck to do that with a 4k video in a foreign country in the middle of nowhere. I know everyone is looking for recurring revenue but come on...
5,The first time I went to use this was in Mexico and I dropped it on the tile floor. I quickly grabbed it and begged it not to be cracked. This thing is a beast! Absolutely perfect still. I ran over my Motorola Razr back in the day and it kept on ticking and im pretty sure this Go pro would be just as idiot proof (me being the idiot) . Great quality images. Survived the mud bath of four wheeling through mountains and snorkeling in the ocean. Cant wait to take it parasailing in two weeks now!
3,This camera takes awful photos and videos and fogs up constantly.. for the price you are better off buying an actual camera. Don't waste your money. Used it twice and it also freezes up.
5,I bought this to use on my upcoming trip to the Philippines. Gonna do some snorkeling while there and bought this to do water shots as well as timelapse night sky shots.  So far I am loving it.
4,Overall great little camera I just wish the battery lasted longer the one that came with the camera dies within about 30 minutes of use even when fully charged. Not all too keen on dishing out more money on extra batteries.
4,I used it for the first time on my ride to work (16 mins both ways) 32 mins of use and battery went from 100% to 43% how sway? How?? And yes I turned it off hold down for few seconds until it beeps turning off.
4,la tengo hace poco tiempo sin embargo la he probado en varias condiciones y funciona muy bien pero en un par de ocasiones se ha congelado la pantalla y la única forma de corregir es extrayendo la batería aunque este defecto ocurre en algunas cámaras según vídeos que he visto.
5,Great service and product. Great seller!!
5,Works well on my motorcycle
1,First let me say that I have used GoPro cameras since the first Hero came out. I am not one to write reviews but this time is an exception. I want to explain what is wrong with the camera I purchased and why I would like a replacement.1. I bought the camera in January 2022 along with other GoPro accessories. I use the camera exclusive in my ecology tour company and now I feel like I was sold a used or returned camera.2. On April 24 2022 while filming underwater the camera went black. It stopped for no reason. I am very disappointed.3. I tried different batteries that were charged to see perhaps if it was a faulty battery. At the moment I was changing the battery I could not see into the well where it sits. But returning home upon further inspection it appears that the unit battery contact point burned out. How is this possible?+4. A month before this happened the camera was in the Kupton waterproof housing and used to take pictures and realized the entire case got extremely hot from the Lithium battery. So hot I had to gingerly open the case to only realize that the entire camera was hot as hell. I had to sit it down to cool off. From that point on I stopped using the case and attached the camera directly to the OFFICIAL GOPRO Pole Stick.5. The camera seemed to work but often it changed modes mysteriously. When I set the mode to video it would jump to Time Lapse for no apparent reason. I am careful not to touch the back screen to ensure this does not happen. The Hero9 is the worst camera I ever owned.6. Now my business will suffer because I am out $350.00 for a camera that only worked for 3 months.7. I humbly ask to return the camera and receive a free replacement from GOPRO to include free shipping  with the new camera.8. The Quick App does not work and this is just another reason why I am thoroughly disgusted with GOPRO and the entire lineup of cameras pole sticks batteries and other accessories that make this the worst season for my business. I need dependable equipment and this product is defective in every way possible.9. I inspected the inside of the camera and indeed the battery contact point is burned likely due the battery over heating the unit.10. I would have provided a picture of the area but cell phone image is not able to see clearly.So unless you plan to use the HERO9 once a month do not buy this camera.
3,So with the factory charge cable the battery will not charge past 85% (with a longer cable I used at first it wouldn't charge past 78%). This was with using a 2A fast wall charger. I did expect the battery during normal use to deplete somewhat quickly but wow just using 1080/60.I need it for work so I bought the 3 battery charger and 2 extra battery kit. With that unit now all 3 batteries will charge to 100%. That is all I got for you hope it helps someone out > good day
4,Great quality and durable just make sure your battery is properly sealed before taking it under water!!!
3,I’m typing this while my GoPro battery depleted and is now not charging. In Qatar it overheated and froze repeatedly. The footage is amazing but the reliability is a 0/10.
5,This recorded well above and below water. With a case it did great at 60ft. Easy to learn and set up
5,Cómo toda GoPro se calienta y las Baterías duran pocoPero muy buenas tomas👌
5,Everything works as it should looked like brand new minus the fancy go pro plastic case I ordered the refurbished or returned and saved some money 💰 No issues at all came fast I've bought other refurbished items from Amazon and they always work great and saves me money on the fancy packaging I throw away anyhow.
5,Have an old Hero 5. Controls and the menu are so much easier to use on the 9. Stabilization is a pretty great addition.The only thing I miss is there isn't a setting to take photos AND video at the same time like the 5 does. Wish it had that. Other than that I love this GoPro!
4,Its a little small
5,I had the hero 5 for a handful of years. And I really liked it. But this one? Oh my goodness sooooo much better!Totally recommend. Doesn’t do great with low light shots. But man I’m loving it!
5,I purchased this camera as an upgrade for my content my previous GoPro 2018 had terrible vibration absorption and you could hear every hand switch. This was a drastic improvement and now I can handle the camera without ruining my videos.
5,Unfortunately it had factory sealing issues luckily because it was a new camera GoPro made me a replacement please immediately test water immersion once you receive the camera.
3,Edit 6/22 after my Son had tried on many occasions to video his rides only to find 30 seconds of video.My Son is a serious Mountain Biker and has records on trails but can never capture his runs due to the issues with this Cameras battery or Memory Card purchased here on Amazon that is the recommended Card for the Hero9.I originally looked into buying the cheaper GoPro Hero7or 8 but when I watched videos of the comparisons to each other it was clear that each upgrade made some serious improvements.So I bought the Hero9 and have been utterly disappointed in its operation.
5,all is ok good trade
5,This GoPro is lightweight and waterproof the outer shell is tough my kids have already dropped it and has survived one of the coolest features is having the front screen P-Touch it makes it a lot easier to see what your filming especially for my e-marketing
5,The one thing I do not like is the side door. If you are wanting to run in a continuous charging application. you must buy a new door that allows the charge cable to connect while still retaining the battery.
4,Brand new and sent the wrong charger. My son was very disappointed. Had a little charge so he got to play for 30%
3,The USBC port does not work. I have tried a number of different chargers that I know work however they do not connect in the GoPro port. I literally have to hold the charger in place for it to stay connected to charge.  Which I don't have time to do so my GoPro just never charges.  It's a great camera I just can't use it often because I can't get it charged.
5,The images show up nicely!  The battery life can meet the needs of daily life.
5,Estoy muy satisfecho buena inversión
5,If you are South African You are safe to purchase from Amazon! Its the same as ordering from our local & trusted TakeAlot. Except you get better specials which counterbalances the extra few days expected for delivery.  I took a chance on them and it worked. Thank you Amazon!
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Until now I enjoy and work fine.
2,it gets stuck and then the water go into the camara everything in failing in this camaraDesde los primero dias de uso me presentaba muchos problema con la SD se usaba hoy y ma;ana ya fallaba aun asi todo funcionaba bien digamos pero un dia de estos la sumergi en agua no mas de un metro y le entro humedad al lente principal y a la pantalla frontal (crei que era el temperado asi que segui) luego de un rato dejo de funcionar y fue que le entro agua a la camara en si en la bateria ahora funciona por que le quite bateria de enmediato pero el water proof no sirve ademas de los contantes problemas de la microSD apenas llevo 5 meses con la cámara!
5,My GoPro 9 arrived just as ordered. Brand new in a convenient box with essentials. The camera is great for the next generation of filming yourself with the new front-facing screen. The stabilization has gotten even better than previous models and the high res and slo-mo options are great for getting any shot I need. Highly recommend upgrading to the 9 if you have anything older.
5,Great great camera for moto vlog I just wish the battery would last a lil longer for the trips I take the memory card dose more than enough but to have to stop to change the battery along the way kinda sucks
5,This GoPro does everything I wanted and more. Not only that it arrived quickly and came perfectly packaged. I am very happy with the GoPro Hero9. TheHero9 Black does everything well. It allows me to capture moments in 5K and I have also found the Video Editing App/Software to be very easy and works great. Highly recommend this especially for a gift.
5,I got it at a good price came in on time before Christmas. My teenager was thrilled with it. It was an upgrade to the previous go pro he had. Over all very satisfied.
5,Bought it for the race car. Very clear high quality videos.
5,I was reluctant to buy another GoPro because I already had the silver . And after intense research against other brands I am very happy I ended up going with this one
1,Just in general a really bad user experience that takes good video.- really bad touch screen- really bad UX / UI- if you bump the screen while in use ( not recording) it will go into another setting / scene- WHEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WOODS IT KEEPS ASKING FOR UPDATES so i set a random time in 2056. I come home connect to my phone "your device is up to date" go back in the middle of no where i get asked to update again and again the popup wont go away so i have to keep setting random dates.Takes great video and the internal gimble is great.i feel 50-50 on it. 50% its awesome 50% super frustrating POS.
5,This is the way to get a GoPro if you already have all the extras. Camera and battery and go.
5,This is my fourth GoPro. The images it captures are amazing! I look forward to trying out all of the features.
3,everything is fine the camera came before even day which they told but I wished to find camera with coverage or bag for a camera or at least Small SD Card to can try camera test photos or Videos But In General all is fine thank you
1,Shuts of randomly while recording. Don't have time while I'm traveling to ship it back so I'm just gonna take the financial loss. GoPro 10 (bought 3) 1 of the 3 gets so hot to touch when charging. The GoPro Max 360 is my favorite but they need a better way to edit filmed content. Wish social media would be able to read the files. Must have editing skills to use the footage. I tour the country in a semi so they are all around my truck. I'm stuck with the 9 for the hood because the other cameras don't offer a water proof case.
2,This thing has so many problems for one it turns on whenever it feels like it draining the battery to zero when sitting idle.Auto-Off after any amount of time doesn't work at all.I do enjoy using it as a camera but it has so many inconvenient quirks they should drop the price by half or more.
5,Great price
5,recommend great for filming
5,Good quality strong stabilization clear and bright colour tones even in low light conditions.
5,I like to catch unexpected moments
5,Great product
5,GoPro is awesome
2,the goPro hero 9 is absurdly difficult to control manually using the 2 buttons it has built in. i cant adjust any settings fast enough to start recording sudden events in optimum quality on the go. video stabilization is great and video quality too. it has a lot of features. but the photo quality is not great.
1,Pros:Looks niceCons:*Overheats quick and turns off in low heat weather and medium heat weather.*Terrible battery life*No easy zoom*Some settings just disappear*Scrolling through settings is cumbersome*Batteries are terrible. Battery life issue.Worthless device pretty much but still use it sparingly.I will never buy one of these devices again.GoawayPro
5,My son loves it
5,Good
5,The best camera
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Great camera
2,Battery life barely lasts 45 mins at 2.7k not worth $350 came in packaging that appeared to be repackaged from a previous user
1,No usable instructions.  No idea how to stream.  Can't get anything to my computer or facebook.  Why do so many companies spend so much to make and market products only to have useless instructions.  Gonna have to return this.  No response to my questions.  Total waste of money.  Do not buy unless you want to be very frustrated.
1,This was purchased as an Xmas gift. My parents took it to Hawaii two months later. It got super hot after two charges and burned out. When I reached out to Amazon they said it wasn't their responsibility even though I purchased a warranty. When I reached out to GoPro they never returned my requests for how to handle/replace/repair. Overall a horrible experience. Just buy from B&H or directly from GoPro there's some shady electronics especially in these "economy packaging" products.
2,I am revising my previous review because I was able to remedy  an issue that I could net remedy with the help of GoPro.  This Hero 9 is not bad but it should cost half the price.
1,After a short few Minutes of filming the camera freezes. I’ve tried different batteries different SD cards updating it and nothing has fixed the issue. Not happy at all
2,I was expecting better quality inn picture clarity battery life. very disappointing. GoPro hero nine is mostly foam; no beer.
1,Arrived damaged and it’s a GoPro8 not a 9! 🤦🏼‍♀️
1,No case. No cold shoe mount they sell that separate for $80 bucks - "Media Mount". Had I known this prior to purchasing I wouldn't have bought the Gopro Hero 9. No power block for charging just the cable Will be returning I don't support cheap skate companies..
2,Product look like a Used one.It's better to buy on go pro site.
1,Came with the car charger instead of usb as advertised it’s been 3 months and unable to use it
1,Had to return it because the battery was heating up at a point where the device was not working properly.
1,Just got this yesterday.  Front picture screen has lines throught it which results in picture distortion. I will be sending it back.  Literally the battery indicator starts dropping within a few minutes of use. I'll try one more time to reorder????
1,Upon first use the tab on the battery pulled off of the back of it not sure if the glue is faulty but it was not stuck or latched hard in the camera
1,This must be some kind of cheap knock off. The video and (especially) the sound seem to pause for a second about every 8-10 seconds. Overall the video is good but the stuttering is really annoying. YES I even tried purchasing a new memory card that's on the recommended list of cards! Same thing!
1,the rear screen cracked after the first time using it . Now I have to go through the hassle of sending back to go pro for warranty
1,I just wish it was more personal
1,
1,What good is a camera that can't be mounted to a tripod?
1,I had to remove the card to transfer photos. Contacted the seller seller was not helpful. Had to return. Got a GoPro10 to replace it. Much better choice.
1,My hero 9 had the back glass crack. I thought "no problem I have the subscription I'll easily get it replaced." Boy was I wrong. GoPro requires you to contact them via online or by phone require the most absurd pictures and make it extremely difficult to get the camera replaced in hopes that you'll just give up. Stay away!
1,GoPro never delivered my camera.  Support so far has been unhelpful.  But a different company's action camera as GoPro's customer support is the worst.
1,I purchased a brand new Hero 9 Black and the waterproof seal broke in less than a month of use.Go Pro support never called back. I got a case number for the issue and was unable to speak to someone from GoPro until a year passed.I got someone else to try and call from the US and eventually they got through. But gopro has not responded since.So I will not recommend buying this as a waterproof camera. And don’t expect gopro to fix or replace it if you do buy it and the seal breaks.
5,So I finally upgraded from the Gopro 3 to the Gopro 9 Black. I have to say the leap in performance is spectacular. The video and the stabilization is great.. But the best part is the battery life.  I am also happy with a 256gb SD card I can get about 7 hrs of video at 2.7K recording. Just pick up a couple of extra batteries and you are golden. Of coarse higher resolution means a bit less recording time but worth it.  If you are a person that streams or records alot you will love this Gopro.
1,I received this newer model to replace an older model as a long-time GoPro customer and respectful of their products. The first day on my Hawaii vacation where I used it for underwater footage the battery compartment leaked and ruined the camera. GoPro customer service was completely unwilling to honor their commitment to customer service and left me hanging with no resolution. There are really only two reasonable outcomes: the product does not seal well at the battery compartment and it's deceiving and the closure mechanism suggests that the compartment is sealed; or it actually does not seal effectively and one cannot tell if it's sealed or not.
1,Gopro refuses to address the known issue with this camera suddenly not recognizing batteries and stopping to charge. The cameras are known to suddenly stop working and Gopro seems only interested in selling new cameras not supporting existing customers.Gopro went from great to garbage very quick. Last time I buy one of their products again.
1,Will nickel and dime you for and inconsistent product and tie you to "pro service" annual fee refusing to reimburse less than a week into annual subscription. Very disappointed all stock sold.
1,
1,These are an absolute joke.  Unless you are filming things that you can replicate when the file is corrupt they are useless.  I run a youtube channel and the amount of redo's that I have to do is ridiculous and most the time not even possible.  I use the remote also and it is also a joke.  I spend more time messing around with the cameras than actually filming.  Only positives I can say is that they are pretty tough against being thrown in frustration.  When they work they are great but that is only about 90% of the time.Summary-  GoPro really needs to focus on reliability and not on packing 8 million "features" in the camera.  I cannot take anyone seriously who would review this as acceptable.  GoPro's of the passed used to be great but I will no longer be using gopro's of this generation or newer.  After that sales pitch anyone want to buy 4 gopro's with a ton of gopro accessories?
1,I wanted to use for moto vids. Needing to use external mic I bought the media mod for the 3.5 mm jack to hook lav up to the cam. Well I was required to update my firmware to view footage via Wi-Fi to my phone. So I updated it. After that using the media mod my external mics were not being recognized. Wish I could return. Total garbage
1,Absolute garbage. Got the GoPro HERO9 from Costco and used the SD card provided in the package.Displays SD card error frequently and entire data was deleted. Tried to recover the data using different recovery software and was not able to recover any videos.
2,just settle for older gopros like the hero 5. the 9 doesnt bring much more to the table and its just stuff you can deal without. theres more grain/noise in the photos and the video quality's the same but not can do 5k. the touch controls are finicky and require multiple attempts to change settings. webcam mode will not be consistent. 10 tries in a row (on GoPro Connect mode not MTP) and all it says is to reconnect camera even though the screen says "usb connected." this is well past the point of diminishing returns and not worth the 300 to 350 USD price tagMine was purchased sealed and brand new at walmart. would be returned if i didnt manage a neat discount
1,If you have Windows 10 and don't subscribe to their monthly software good luck video editing on PC!Pictures are great and video features are great but check out GoPro forums or even reddit about their software and their software support and developers are crap!If I knew all this before buying it I would have gotten the Insta360 One X2 instead!!! It does everything this gopro does plus it shoots in 360! This allows you to get ANY angle all the time! The software is completely free to use and you can edit completely from your phone! I think I read on the forums that the Insta software actually lets you edit gopro vids too so I'll be trying that out soon.
1,The touch screen does not work making the camera unusable. It’s not just mine thousands of people have this issue. It’s just a $400 paper weight. DO NOT BUY
5,Fantastic item but battery is still lacking.  Easy to use great quality highly recommend with extra batteries.
5,Great Thank
5,
5,Es la primera vez que compro una cámara de esta marca me dejo impresionado con su diseño tamaño y calidad de cámara también las diferentes funciones con las que cuenta el agua no le afecta en nada y tiene buen rendimiento en cuando a la batería
5,I love the (9) but the battery life could be much better. I might have been given a bad battery from the company.  I use it to and from work on my Motorcycle....it has been helpful for the "just incase" something needs to be proven.
5,I had to return the original product because it wouldn't charge. The supplier sent out a new replacement before I returned the original. That's quality service! The GoPro Hero 9 works great and it's been used snowboarding for 15 days in a row without any issues!
4,Got this for my guy before we went on a snorkeling vacation. He had to run out last minute to get a memory card and spare battery and some other accessories to make this complete. What you get with this order is bare bones so just be aware. I was so embarrassed  to give him a gift that he had to go out and spend $200 more to use! Battery lasted only a few hours so we needed a spare for our all day snorkel charter.That said he loves this camera and will get lots of fun uses out of it!
5,Battery last longer than my old go pro- easy to use durable
5,Con está marca uno va a la fija son excelentes artículos
5,It’s expensive
5,Llegó super rápido y es de excelente calidad todo salió mejor de lo que creía cumplió con mis espectativas.
5,Recomendado llego muy rapido bien empacado y funcionando correctamente y la Gopro esta genial
5,Good little action camera. I hope it is better than the last one which leaked. I also am having trouble with the voice commands. So a call into GoPro is in order!! Overall good camera
5,After purchasing a few kinds of GoPro cameras in the past I can absolutely say this is the best one yet. The 5K video is incredible I can’t believe this little camera can be that clear especially when it’s moving around. It has something called HyperSmooth which I guess stabilizes the video and what can I say it really does work. I tried that feature out while zip lining in Costa Rica and now I have such amazing videos. The photos are insanely good too with 20MP quality. I was even able to use the GoPro underwater when snorkeling in Costa Rica. It comes with everything described on the listing and it came within 2 days of placing the order just in time for my trip. Highly recommend this camera to anyone that loves the outdoors and adventure. It would make for a really cool Christmas gift so I’ll be getting one for my brother as well.
5,Excellent product once again by GoPro. Very easy use excellent video quality great optionality. Product came as advertised and has not disappoint after several weeks of using. Looking forward to much more use of my GoPro. Seller was also excellent and product came in perfect condition.
5,I don't know if I xan say anymore about the Gopro Hero 9 that hasn't already been said a hundred times over. This is great motion stabilizing camera. Action videos are clear. The microphone is great. This camera works for hundreds of uses. I highly recommend the Gopro Hero 9
5,GoPro delivers yet again with the Hero 9. The package arrived very fast which was a nice surprise and the 9 doesn't disappoint! Amazing picture quality (20MB) 5k video and always appreciated ... increased battery life. The 9 is a must-have IMO!
4,Why would you send this without a sim card?  So that it can not even be used?When pricing this would be good to know. But all and all I bought two for my son and I and so far we are happy with them.
5,I bought this for a trip to Los Roques archipelago a place full of marine biodiversity. Totally worth it I was able to shoot amazing videos of the reefs and sea life. The quality of the camera makes my semiprofessional camera looks like an old phone.
5,This was an upgrade to an old GoPro hero 6. The 5k video and LCD screen were what pushed me to make the upgrade. So far very impressed with the quality of the camera and ease of use (not much different than my current GoPro). This is a no brainer for anyone who likes to record videos while they travel or do any type of biking/hiking. 10/10 camera.
5,I really love the gopro hero 9  amazing record and takes pictures are unbelievable I love it the stability still
5,So tired of having wife hold camera on rides we decided to get a GoPro and decided on the 9. Videos are great steady and clear. We're using the 1080 setting to save memory card and it's awesome. I got the wind cover and now I can hear my music and conversation instead of whistling wind. We hard wired ours to the bike power supply as the batteries just don't last that long. (about 45m on a 2000mah) Get used to the camera navigation before heading out and your experience will also be great. We love it.
