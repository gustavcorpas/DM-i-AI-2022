5,The USB C Hub HDMI Adapter is great! I misplaced my old one and this one works better and was cheaper than the one I misplaced. I love how lightweight it is it doesn't tangle and has 5 inserts for different plug ins. I love it! 5 starts!
5,I did try others and quite frankly they didn’t have the same heft or that sense of “quality” however subjective that may actually be. But I can say after only using it for a few hours and I did try and put it through that paces of my needs I have to say that I was quite pleased with how it held up.I am using this with a 2020 MacBook Air 8GB and 512GB. This is used heavily for photography. I use a Lenovo 32” monitor and I wanted the 4K HDMI connection. I tried other and though they worked I say again that just didn’t feel like quality pieces even though I paid more for them.Point is I was skeptical for something at this price point but I took the chance and I am glad that I did. Considering the quality of others your needs and then think on this one. Like me you may find that this one is exactly what you need.
5,I got a new MacBook and was very excited until I went to plug in a USB and there were no ports for a USB. This provides ports for up to 2 USB devices 1 Sport device card readers and 1 HDMI port. It is lightweight not really chunky provides what I need and works well. There's not glitching or easy disconnect on cords.
5,I purchased this for my MacBook Pro M1 2020 Model. I’ve tested this hub for HDMI SD Card USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 Port. It’s small enough to fit in my Laptop bag. Easy to use. Doesn’t require any installation. Works as intended with no issues. Also tested on a Dell Inspiron Windows 10 Device and Hub worked with no issue. The Micro SD card slot didn’t work on my 1st unit however unit got replaced with no problems. Good product for the price.
5,I love my MacBook Air but it has only two USB C ports and most of my peripherals are USB 3. This little adapter provides two USB 3 ports plus a charging port for USB so I can connect three USB 3 devices and still charge my MacBook. It works perfectly with my Brother laser printer my Fujitsu ScanSnap scanner and my WD external hard drive. Also it is very light and portable so I can move it with no problem. For less than $25 this adapter is one of the best purchases I have ever made. Definitely worth five stars.
5,This product works exactly as intended. Gives me the extra ports I need on my Lenovo Yoga 7i. Being able to use a HDMI is reason enough but I've found that I use the additional USB ports more often than I expected as well.
5,There are many of these in the market... but what I love about this one is if you have a case like I do I don't have to take it off to connect it; I can have more than 1 USB at the same time. It is wonderful the quality is great too. And it the price is excellent too.I HIGHLY recommend it.
5,It works on Macbook M2 2022! It is great!
5,Works perfectly for MacBook Air since it doesn't have a USB port.  Very nice design with a bag for it for storage.
4,Unfortunately it doesn’t actually come with any cords to attach to your TV so I couldn’t give 5 stars (especially when I wasn’t even sure I’d have one myself). But I found an old one at home attached it to the adapter and it was smooth sailing from then on. I really like this and wish I had gotten one sooner during the peak of the pandemic to watch movies on the big screen! But even still I enjoy having this adapter! Works well with my latest MacBook Air.
5,I am very pleased with my purchase of an adaptor for my laptop computer. It has an HDMI slot two USB slots and a camera card one too. This is perfect for all my needs as a marketing and communications coordinator. The card slot is especially handy for when I take video and photographs. The adaptor plugs into my new macbook pro via the USB -C cable. Now I can seamlessly make use of all my devices on my new laptop. Thank you very much.
5,Purchased a new MacBook Air 2021 for work and needed to be able to connect to a larger monitor to run dual monitors and still be able to connect stuff by usb and this product has worked perfectly.
5,This works well with MacBook Pro 2020.  I have found it very versatile for connecting different devices.  Since it has a cord it also lets me have a hard shell cover for my laptop
5,Serves the purpose handles the number of connections I need with my MacBook Pro.  So far satisfied.
5,At this price point it's hard to argue with!  Seems to do exactly what I want it to which is give me usb access to the back of my iMac without having to turn the computer around on the desk.  My only complaint is that it seems to have to be sitting just right as if it's not the usb's on the device seem to lose contact with the flash drive and it ejects it.  also wish maybe the usb-c chord was about a 1/4 inch longer.  But all in all definitely recommend a good product at a great price.
4,The actual product is beautiful and sleek. Fits as it should into the C-drive and several USB ports are available as well as a memory card slot. However when connected into the MacBook Pro 2020 the computer is unable to find it. The dockling light of the B3 turns on and shows that it is working the computer knows that something is there but it is unable to read and process the information.
5,Works great with my MacBook Pro
5,Used this product to connect macbook to large monitor.  this product works with the 2020 m1 macbook air and HP VH240a 23.8-Inch monitor.
5,This product is exactly what I was looking for! It looks just like the picture and works great. Very good price too! Works great with my MacOS Monterey 2021. I definitely recommend for anyone needing an adapter for their Mac!
4,This works on the MacBook Air (M1 2020). The device is actually smaller than I expected but that's probably good as its lightweight. It's simple to use: just plug it in and it's ready to go. (A little blue light comes on to tell you the power is on.)I bought this so I could access files from a SanDisk Cruzer Glide USB Flash Drive (I looked it up and it's 2.0. This device has ports for 2.0 and 3.0 USBs). I also like that it has two slots for memory cards. The only thing is this didn't recognize a Memory Stick ProDuo from an old Sony digital camera that I had laying around. The slot was too wide for it. It would've been a cool bonus to have that work.You can also hook this up to your smart TV via a HDMI cable (not included). I still haven't hooked it up however as I have a bunch of stuff connected to the TV already and haven't had the time to mess around with it back there.Also once I plugged in the USB it worked pretty fast and smooth.Hope this helps.
5,I love that I can have multiple devices plugged in. The device is sleek and very portable. It comes with a little bag for storage and it’s perfect. I wish it had MORE ports but it’s definitely a great product as is!
5,I love how convenient this USB C adaptor is for the MackBook Air. It is easy to use and carry with me when I have to do presentations. I also loved that fact that it has multiple slots such an HDMI USB and a camera.
5,i like the comfortability of the product .easy to use and very nice as well so much good features .
5,I used this to connect my Macbook Air to a variety of other tools. Frankly I had to return a couple of other products because either they didn;t work or they were too flimsy. This B3 USB C Hub Adapter has proven reliable and efficient.
5,I bought similar kind product from Amazon for $30 and did not have a wire connection to the laptop n caused loose connection I’ve to hold it to make it work but this product does have the wire and works totally fine. Totally happy with the purchase.
5,Works with Hp Pavilion 15 Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite
5,I was worried about compatibility but this adapter worked with my brand-new McBook Air M1! Now I can have two USB flash drives going at the same time when archiving my photos and files.
5,This is awesome for the price. Good value.  Sturdy and can be used for different things.
5,Hooks up easily. Works great for usb as well as helping upload pictures from our camera directly!
5,Just received the product and it is exactly as described.  I have my MacBook connected to a TV and Apple monitor and the TV picture is very clear. I had previous bought a few others but they wouldn't work with the TV so glad this one did.
5,Purchased the hub for my new MacBook Air m1. Just plugged in and was able to connect it with my external monitor which has an hdmi port. It's lightweight and also comes in with a nice black case. Perfect for the price you pay. Highly recommend!
4,Much smaller than I anticipated but I'm happier with this size. Versatile and works well with my IMac (M1 2021) so that I can have multiple things plugged in at once.
5,Works well with iPad Pro. I'm using it to hook up an audio interface to stream live to Facebook.
5,Plugged it in and it worked with no issue! Connects fine to devices and even SD cards.Great little device for my MacBook Pro (13-inch M1 2020)!
4,Works with my Macbook Pro 2019 well. There are times though when my mouse and keyboard stop working and I have to restart computer. Not often but still an issue.
5,I like the design of this adapter. It keeps my cords from bending in ways that would damage them. Overall a very effective product for Macs.
5,Exactly what you could’ve asked for. Fits in 2 usb 1 usb-c and even an HDMI. great product
5,It works plus for my MacBook Air and iPad mini - it just does its job.
5,the product is as described and seems to have no negative affect on battery.
5,I needed this in order to transfer my photo files from my Nikon D7000. Looking forward to finding other ways to incorporate this into my daily computer needs.
5,This hub suits my needs perfectly. Pairs easily with MacBook air doesn't need a lot of space solid connection. The entire process was seamless quick easy. Wished I bought this years ago before I got rid of memory cards.....  A superb Prime Day purchase. Everyone with only a C port on their laptop needs one of these hubs.
5,I use it for my dj controller and it works perfect
5,Using on Macbook Pro 2022; works great for wired keyboard and mouse
5,I like the small bag that comes with the adapter since I travel for work sometimes.  Also it was easy to set up quickly with my Mac and even charge my phone at the same time.
5,Great product. Easy to use
5,I bought this to use with my new 2022 M2 MacBook Air. Every port works great to access all of the features. Compact enough to keep with me in my backpack so I can have access to the different ports on the go. Must have for Mac users!
5,Very easy to use. Works perfectly with M2 MacBook Air. I am happy with it.
4,I have used many of these before and this is a solid one. I usually get issues with loose ports but do not foresee that happening. I have a mic computer and keyboard connected. HDMI not working but it may be my computer configuration
5,Perfect for a tablet.
5,So easy to use -- plugged it in to Macbook and used the HDMI input for a second monitor ... worked perfectly with a few setting adjustments on my macbook. Perfect for what we needed for a collage student to use a larger monitor with Macbook.
4,2 of my 3 USB ports stopped working and my HDMI port was acting up as well. I was looking for a workaround. This looked like it would work. It is very nice out of the package light and sleek. However the cab;e is only about 6 inches long(see pic). I use my laptop on my lap and the unit kept falling off. My computer an Acer Swift 3 using windows 11 kept saying it was unrecognized. When I hooked up the HDMI it didn't work. This may be due to a defect in the unit I got. I returned it mostly because of the cable length.
5,Compatible with my MacBook Pro! I love how versatile this product is (hdmi compatible usb b usb c hdmi memory card)
5,This product is very useful for interfacing with MacAir. I used for data transfer .Very fast and easy .It's very light weight. easily portable and simple to operate. it's simple to work with any medium for data transfer.
5,Works will dell xps 15 9520
4,This USB-C Adapter works great! I use it with my 2019 16-Inch Macbook Pro. The adapter works when using both Mac OS and Windows. There is little to no delay when using the HDMI port on the adapter. The USB ports also work great with my keyboard and mouse. The only thing I'm wary about is the Micro SD Reader. When inserted correctly the Micro SD Card reads flawlessly. Moving data to and from the card is quite quick as well. The problem is that you really need to make sure you put your Micro SD in the reader very carefully. Certain Micro SDs could possibly get stuck if put in the wrong way. This adapter is great but be very careful when using the Micro SD reader.
5,I like this USB hub. It has just the connectors that I need. I know there are others that have 10 11 or even 12 connectors but for me this one is perfect. It is small compact lightweight and just works. I am using it with a 13 inch MacBook Pro with the M1 processor without any issues. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a USB hub and doesn’t want to spend $20 $30 or more dollars.
5,works with Macbook Air M2 and Cintiq13HD
5,Small in size and dies the job
5,I havent tried the hdmi yet but it's compatible with my MacBook Pro 2017 and the SD cards and the USB works really well :) I'm happy it comes with a little bag :)
4,works with macbook pro like i expected but i was also able to use it on my 2021 ipad pro
5,Works great!
5,Perfect compatibility for my new Mac Book M2 2022 13in. I enjoy having this so I can still use my HDMI and flash drives! The quality with connection is perfect. Highly recommend.
5,Lo he utilizado con Lenovo Yoga Surface pro8 MacBook Air y Asus GL502 sin dificultades.
5,Works with MacBook Pro well
5,
5,The adapter works with my Macbook Pro 2020 model and my HP display. Everything looks good to me!
5,This device works great with Steam Deck.  Outputting had some major input and audio lag with 4k tv when playing games  however it ran seamlessly on my 1080p tv and monitor which are the ones I mostly use.
4,This device works as advertised. I have tested all the outputs except the HDMI. The only problem was SD cards want to miss the socket and slide inside the case of the device.
5,Works well with MacBook Air 2021
5,Fantastic port and worked great with my 3rd monitor hdmi cord
5,Finally don’t  have to have 5 different gadgets to do one job!  Love it .. transferee pictures easily!!👍
5,wanted to be able to have more adapters and have something that I could hook up to my computer monitor and this worked great for a really good price works with 2022 MacBook Pro
5,This was great for my MacBook Pro 2019. It allows me to plug my hdmi cord and charger in through the same single port!
5,Sleek and efficient =) Recommend! Works with MacBook Air
5,I've had this for about a day and it works great with the M2 MacBook Air 2022.  Helps free up ports and doesn't get in the way of the MagSafe charging port.  Pretty fast reading also.
5,Light weight with solid looking.  Works perfect for my MacBook Air.  When you carry a backpack for a day every gram adds up.
5,I love/hate my Apple laptop; it's a superior product but of course you have to buy extra adapters for everything. I didn't even look at how much the official Apple adapter costs (I'm sure it's a lot!). I found this on Amazon and after reading it's almost universally positive reviews for a really affordable price I got it myself. It's great! I've personally tested every single plug-in and they all work flawlessly. This is a great product at a great price!
3,When this is plugged into the port it causes problems when trying to save (program can get hung up and become unresponsive) until I unplug it.  After I unplug it the program saves whatever I was working on. It also prevents the computer from restarting.  I am past the return window but will look for a different one to use.
5,Works with iPad Air 5th generation. Exactly what we needed
5,Works great with my MacBook Air M1.  The video USB power and USB ports work perfect.  I haven't tried out the memory card readers yet.  I even have a USB hub plugged into one of the USB ports and they all work.  Great value for the price.  I'm going to buy another one to use in my RV.
5,Loved getting this product in and having it work right away with my Macbook air (2018). I had recently bought a monitor and this allowed for connectivity between the two. The HDMI output is great and the rest of the ports work as advertised!
5,I have a Macbook Pro and it works seamlessly with it.Tried microsd and USB and works smoothly so far..Value for Money
5,works with Mac book air 2020. and the HDMI adapter works great and the monitor responds in real time. I would recommend to anyone on a budget.
5,This has been a reliable and versatile connector for my M1 MacBook Air.  HDMI works great and it’s just the right combo of connections including USB-C that I need.
5,works with MacBook Air seemlessly.  No install or set up...it just works
5,Just what I needed!  This works with my new MacBook Pro A2485.  The internet in my kitchen is very slow so I wanted to plug my MacBook into the internet.  I also wanted a wired mouse.  My MacBook has none of these plugs.  This adapter works for all my needs.  I can also view sd cards!  Very happy with this purchase.
5,Works just fine for MacBook Pro. Can finally plug in USB’s with ease.
5,Easy to use. Works great. Hooked my MacBook air up to my hp monitor with it. Everything works as should. Would definitely recommend!
5,This product is great! I used it get photos from my camera on a micro SD card onto my 2021 MacBook Air and it works great! Though sometimes my computer had a hard time recognizing the item but it served it purpose and is the cheapest one I’ve seen so I would recommend this!
5,I have purchased this adapter for my newmac and i’m more than satisfiedIt’s very easy to use and maintain.You can use it not only for HTMI.Quality is great.Highly recommend this product to everyone
5,Works with the new MacBook I just got and needed for school. I really needed a way to connect my camera so I love the SIM card adapter.
5,Perfect tool for using a projector in a venue where I just brought my computer and the docking station. Portable small and efficient.  Great product.
4,- very light & portable- works well with MacBook Air
5,Works with MacBook Pro 2022
5,Placed the order with same day delivery because I was in a pinch. It arrived by 2:30PM and I plugged it right in. Worked flawless on my Dell XPS which only has the USB-c ports. I have a couple devices with regular USB ends so this is great to have. Another great feature which I will be using is the SD card reader. I still use an old shock proof digital camera while out onsite and this is a great way to zip my photos over to my laptop. Overall best bang for your buck with value and performance!
4,I like how its small. Works well with macbook pro 2020
4,Received in June 2022. Works with MacBook Pro 14” . Easy and intuitive. I can recommend!
4,I bought this to use with my MacBook Air. I use it for the charger mouse and HDMI cord. So far so good and worth the value.
4,Just purchased so review isn’t from a long term use perspective. But the packing was tamper proof yet easy to open. Once I plugged it into my laptop and inserted my usb I was able to use the additional apparatus and a good plus was that I didn’t have to take the backing from my laptop off to use it like others (helps with scratch protection).
4,I bought this to use with my MacBook and it works well and as intended.
5,I bought this for use with my new MacBook Pro 13". I wanted something with many different ports and something slim that would be easy to carry with me. I chose the c wired end because I thought dongles that plugged directly into the 2 ports on my computer might get easily bent. This one gives me more flexibility to set my computer on different surfaces.
5,Very versatile. Works with MacBook Air 2019. I also use it to plug my HDMI and watch movies on a bigger screen. Doesn’t look cheap fits the aesthetic. I would recommend!
5,My Microsoft surface only has one usb-c port and this allows me to do more and have more connections !
5,Flexibility and compact it serves a variety of configurations that handles any form of outlet whether it’s an old Mac… A new Mac… Or any other Mac!
5,I like it. Good Quality. It’s works for my MacBook.
5,Great extention compatible with MacBook Air 13 inch with M1 chip. Very smooth user experience - easy to setup and get the device working
4,Does the job; however if you plug in too many things at once it makes everything lag. I can't use my mouth and dual screen because the mouse is incredibly delayed. Otherwise it's good to go.
4,It works well and is super easy to access the ports would recommend.
4,Easy to use as described. Works well work my MacBook Air. Light weight and can fit in my laptop sleeve easily.
5,It seems you have to change the options to the mouse settings. It might scroll in the inverse order.
5,Exactly what I needed.
5,Works with my MacBook like I needed it too. Also worked with our iPad which was great! I’m always a sucker for a knock off brand that works just like name brand.
5,I bought this dongle as a Hail Mary because I'd tried everything else to get my monitor to respond effectively when I awakened my computer.  I have a 2019 MacBook Air.  This B3 was incredibly simple to use -- easy to insert the cords into the appropriate ports -- and immediately my monitor came to life.  Sleeping Beauty awakens!  5 stars.
5,This adapter made it easy to control the tangle of cords required for my extended display set up when using my macbook air. It is small sleek and the extended cord allows for better cord management for a neater set up in your workspace. Very happy with the overall plug and play usability as well as the numerous ports for easier use with my apple products with only the fraction of the cost for the same products provided by apple!
5,Was looking for a 4k HDMI adapter to connect a MacBook Air 2021 and a Lenovo 4k IPS UHD monitor and this one works perfectly. Easy to hook up and looks more compact in person than the picture shows. Used the spare USB-3 ports for mouse and keyboard all without issues.
5,I just needed a way to hook up another monitor to my 2017 iMac and I purchased this one because it had several other ports. I’ve already found uses for the ports I thought I didn’t need 💜 Works exactly as needed/promised. 🙌🏻
5,Very light weight slick compatible with most Mac books ready to use at any time. Does not take long periods of time to load. Very efficient for your money. Will buy in future.
5,works with my Macbook Pro 2019 Dell P2415H.i really enjoy it and it has a HDMI port which is perfect!! love this USB c type HUB
5,Everything works well with my macbook pro. Good product for a good price!
5,Great product - been using it for a month now. Hopefullly will last long
5,Easy plug and play. Compatible with MacBook Pro
5,es compatible con MacBook Pro 2020 es liguero y tiene todos los puertos de entrada descrito
5,At this price point it's hard to find another product that compares. $20 or below and you get basically an additional four ports for the price of one USB-C port. I use this hub mainly to connect a Ledger crypto wallet that utilizes micro USB to my Macbook Pro which only has USB-C ports. I've also used it to connect USB 3.0 flash drives to my Mac and it has worked perfectly thus far.
5,Came in handy when I was in Germany to charge my Apple Watch and ear buds. Also worked with USB storage stick. I just bought new 2022 MacBook Air.
5,I just bought a new laptop and was struggling with the lack of ports and needed an adapter. When I started to look many did not have the SD card reader and the ones that did were pretty expensive. I was happy to find this one at a price I felt comfortable paying. It's easy to use - light but not so light that if feels cheap. I am very happy with the product.
5,I have been using this everyday for a little over a month now with my m1 macbook pro and have 0 problems. I highly recommend this purchasing this port.
5,I am happy with this product thanks
5,I have a Dell XPS 15'' (XPS 9320). This USB C Hub works great! I use the HDMI/USB/SD ports daily and they work great.
5,I am using this with a MacBook Pro 14-inch 202 and it works well for the USB the smaller ones and it also works very well for charging devices.
5,This hub works well with the MacBook Air.  I bought it to connect my new laptop with my current home office setup and it integrated the laptop seamlessly.
5,Does exactly what is mentioned in the description.Product is so compatct and light weight.I like the product.
5,Great build quality - a huge upgrade from the dongle that cam with my computer with way more ports and better quality parts
3,Used this to restore windows on an HP x360.  It worked to add a USB network card since windows wasn't picking up a driver for the internal card- which impressed me.  I also was able to use it to copy files to various media from my HP Zbook 14u.***Update***Returned - luckily I tested the data transfer speeds before my return window closed.  The advertised rate of speed for TF card data transfer was not met.  I never got data to transfer at above 15MB/s (85%+ slower than advertised is significant).Also- the USB C port on this is power pass through only.  If you read the description with this in mind you can tell that it's advertised this way.  However I think most people will assume you can connect a USB C device (a phone hard drive etc.) and have it recognized and work.  That is NOT the case.  It supplies power pass-through only- NO data.It does some things well but ultimately did not live up to what is advertised so I've reduced my rating to three stars and I have returned the product. I primarily wanted this to move large files to a micro SD (TF) card at high speed and it does not do that.
5,Works with MacBook Pro 2019 Dell P2415HIts light weight so you can carry it around easily it has great quality of material and it’s not expensive at all
5,The product is lightweight and sturdy. I'm able to connect thumb drives to my MacBook Air and also connect my extra monitor to my MacBook via HDMI.
5,6 in 1 hub works great.
5,This is exactly what I expected it to be. Works flawlessly and I love the charge through feature. I can leave this hooked up to my MacBook and charge whenever I need to without needing to take up another valuable port. Definitely recommend. Shoulda bought sooner.
5,It works with my MacBook Air perfectly
5,I’m using this for my projector and it connects really well to my MacBook Pro. Love the little bag it comes in too.
4,ease ofuse
5,Todo muy adecuado y funcional
5,Light weight does not heat up like the others I’ve tried but only 5 out of the 6 ports work. The USB-C port doesn’t as it neither charges devices nor access device data.Update: The one delivered had only 5 ports working but the supplier provided me with excellent customer service and sent me a new device with all the 6 ports working perfectly fine. i recommend.
5,Works well on my Mac
5,Works great for all the stuff I need to hook up to my laptop in the office
5,Love the SD slot. Super convenient Cord so I can plug other things along with it
4,works fine with macbook pro 2019! 🙂
4,Works fine with MacBook Air. Worth what it costs. Only issue I’ve encountered so far is that when plugging in the HDMI cord to connect to the TV it transferred the image but not the sound. But in all fairness I’ve only tried once.
4,It took a lot of messing around to get the USB ports to recognize my mouse receptor. but onces it got working it worked well.
4,This product is simple and easy to use and the price is right.  I also like that the connection to my Macbook Air does not block the power port like some USB C Hub adapters do.
5,Works perfectly with my new surface pro 8! Will make it easy to project and use my flash drives etc.
5,Works great with MacBook Pro. Super versatile! Makes giving presentations easier and is compact for travel. Happy with my purchase!
3,I have an HP monitor with a usb c adapter that works fine when plugged directly into my macbook but plugging into this adapter it doesn't work.  The other usb a ports seem to be working and didn't test the memory card slots.
5,This product was perfect for the work that I needed to do from home. It made it possible for me to attach to a large monitor still using my own Mac laptop. This made my work so much easier. And delivery was fast.
4,Works with mac book pro 2022
5,I used this to connect my MacBook Air to my Cricut Air machine.  Worked perfectly.
5,(I use a MacBook Air M1)Personaly I only needed it for usbs but the HDMI is great to have. I have used it for Netflix works great and honestly charging with works great too. I did not notice a difference when charging through the extension cable. The 2 USB ports work and I don’t really need anything else from the cable and does the job for what I need it.
5,Works great with MacBook Air 2022.
5,Hands down this is the best option for your SteamDeck it works flawlessly. I absolutely love how fast and how perfectly discrete it is. Perfect for full PC compatibility.
5,It works good with my Macbook Air.
5,I recently bought a new Apple MacBook that does not have a traditional USB port. I use various items that connect to my old MacBook but needed a new connector to help with my HDMI and SD needs. I was able to find this adapter which works perfectly. It’s great having one adapter too!
5,Ordered this adapter when we purchased a new 13" MacBook Air with thunderbolt ports and USB-C ports. Since USB ports were no longer available we needed an adapter and this works great with our new MacBook!
5,Works as advertised with all type of connections - great product
5,Hooked it up to my MacBook and monitor it was super easy to use and works great. Love the way I can hide it for a cleaner desk setup.
5,Works great with my lenovo duet 5 it was not too pricey either. I'm enjoying all the accessories that I can use now because of this USB C-Hub
5,I think this product is great. It does what I need it to do.
5,Annoying that apple has gotten rid of all the ports on their computers. Luckily this little device allows you do all the things you used to be able to do on an old desktop. I use mine with my mac book air. Works great!
5,I love this device because it works well with my MacBook and I don't have to have a million dongles :O)  I also like that I can use this and still have my charging port
5,Using on MacBook Air for work to connect a 2nd screen charge my laptop and connect my wireless mouse/keyboard.  Works great and not having any issues. Definitely worth the money!
5,Exactly what I needed to quickly disconnect one plug and go mobile. I have my USB mouse keyboard Bluetooth headset dongle and HDMI monitor plugged in and it works perfect.
5,Multiple ports are well made no problems connecting my Macbook Pro with my Dell Monitor and sleek design make it nice to fit on my desk.
5,Works great with MacBook Air M1 2020. It is easy detected when inserted or taken out
4,Works greatperfect size to throw in bag and go

5,excellent good product
3,Well I like the fact that it uses the USB C plug in but what I don't like is I can't use my keyboard or mouse on the USB inputs on the hub with a HP Elitebook.
5,Just what I needed works with Microsoft Surface Pro 8 adding the extra ports needed.
5,It’s perfect! Just what I was looking for. Works great on my MacBook Air. Helps a lot for my small business.

1,This product scratched 3 of my SD cards and I lost ALLLLL my photoshoot sessions.At first it was working great. Really fast. And then as I was backing up my pictures it said it was unreadable. I put the SD card in my camera and it said the same thing. I FREAKED out! Went to Best Buy and that’s when they told me my SD cards were scratched. It’s been devastating!!! And expensive bc now I have to pay to see if I can retrieve these photos which most likely they’re not but i have to pay a diagnostic fee.I wish I would’ve read the bad reviews bc it happened to someone else… the exact same thing.PLEASE avoid the headache and frustration. Do NOT get this product.
5,Works with 2017 mac book pro 15inch
5,great product! works very well with macbook Pro !
5,Works well with my MacBook pro.
5,Works wells with thinkpad macbook and  windows
2,I bought this hub for projecting Zoom conference calls to my monitor using the HMDI port.  The quality was shaky at best.  I am not sure if the degradation was just the nature of the phone streaming or the additional of the HDMI connection or some other reason.  Thus I can not blame the hub directly.  My 2-star rating is more of not knowing what additional uses I can benefit from so for now it is sitting with my other unused cables and connectors.
5,Needed a portable connector to travel with for business purposes. Being a Macbook user needed a port converter so I can use any monitor with a HDMI slot. Also I use multiple gadgets including phones and wireless speakers and now all of my pains are resolved.
5,Works with my MacBook Air
3,Nice product but it is not compatible with Lenovo Yoga 9i
5,
1,I bought this primarily to use it to access RAW photo files from Cannon 80D for transfer to my MacBook Pro for processing. For a few seconds it worked beautifully. The images were quickly readable as icons but when I attempted to change the files to list view it crashed. I tried a few more times with the same result. After a few times my Computer popped up a message saying the device cannot read the device attached..... It gets worse. I put the data card back in the camera planning to transfer the files wireless but now my camera cannot read the data card. The card is only about a month old and is a high quality / high speed card. I fear I'll have to reformat the card and hope I can save it. However the great photos I've beenchassing of a Pileated Woodpecker will be destroyed in the process..... you get what you pay for and this cheap device is a piece of junk.... DON'T BUY.
1,This was awful. I used this product with my new Macbook air that I purchased in July so I know it wasn't my computer. The microSD reader would not work I tried it with 3 different microSD cards. One of them was taken directly taken out of the package and placed into the USB C Hub. So then I tried to connect the HUB directly to my camera so that I wouldn't have to use the microSD slot and that didn't even work. My camera wouldn't connect to my computer through this device. Overall waste of money.
1,I was really excited about this product but it doesn’t work. I have a portable monitor that I like to hook my laptop up to but it needs to be plugged into both the usb-c and hdmi slots so I’d never be able to charge my laptop while using the second monitor. So I did research and most of the similar products were $40-$60. I was so excited to find this for less than half of the cost of the others & it looked perfect. It got here a day later than expected but I was still really excited until I tried using it and it lit up but it didn’t work. I unplugged it and tried to use the monitor with just my laptop and it worked perfectly. This item is defective :( I guess you get what you pay for.Update: instead of returning i ordered a replacement. It doesn’t work. At all. I received another defective one. I’m going to just pay the $45 for a higher end one that actually works
1,Opened it up and it looks nice. My main purpose is to use it for a MicroSD card on a MacBook so I opened a brand new $50 card and slid it in.  It easily went in until flush.  Expecting it to spring back out i pushed it in further.  It went in way too far and in an attempt to get it out (toothpick with bit of superglue) it went all the way in and is now rattling around inside.  I see no way of opening up the case to get the card out.  Not sure what to do next.  At least there was no data on the card to lose.EDIT:  Turns out the micro sd card holder is misaligned enough that the card can slide in below it but with enough resistance it feels like it’s going in properly.  Photo added.
2,Very light and great with usb drives. It’s memory card reader is a 50/50 shot with RAW format images.
5,Works well with my 2019 MacBook Air
2,Does not read SD or mini SD (Which is why I purchased it for) it got two stars because it came with a gift card stating that the product was not tested and may be faulty.
5,good quality and reasonable cost
1,I bought 2 of these Docking Stations to facilitate mounting external drives to my and my husband's MacBook Pro laptops.  I really wanted them to work and am very disappointed that they don't.  On each Docking Station only one of the USB ports worked; the other USB and the USB C port did not work.  I'm returning both of them.And yes - in order to be sure that the problem was not with my cables or my external drives I tested with different cables and different drives.
2,Was supposed to stay cool and work with ios or MacBook- not sure what I’m supposed to call it however it did not work as described (I’m sure it was cheap to the seller but 30-40$ to me…) I had a much cheaper sleek device and it has not only worked well but never gotten warm or malfunctioned. So in this case we go price effective for the win.
1,Connected it to my Macbook Pro and only the HDMI port works. The USB ports do not work.Didn't test the SD cards bays.
1,I got the item and the power and USB connection worked fine but I am on holiday now and took lots of pictures and went to load them onto the computer and the SD card reader does not work. It's past the amazon return window so they tell me. Do not accept this product without testing every connection.
1,Cheap Material and stopped working after 1 day. You get what you pay for save your money for a better seller
1,Something wrong with the microsd slot allowed my card to go in way too far and can't get it out.  They bribe you with a gift card to give a 5 star review but it's junk.
1,Light indicated it was on but computer never registered that it was working. Never got it to work.
1,The HDMI Adapter doesn't work with Ipad Pro M1. And The HDMi Adapter for Mac Mini works but erve 5 minutes the monitor blanks and came back. And the USB-C port it is only for charge doesn't work with other devices such as portable SSD. Really disappointed! Works only to read cards or usb A type reading.
1,It’s very slow to deliver from printer to pcWas trying to print all day  i believe was driver fold I reinstalled the drivers same problem  I call my friend to bring me his original from apple and the printer was working perfectly
1,I purchased 2 of these and both of them kept “ejecting” in the middle of a file transfer. One quit right before the 30 day return window and the other quit right after. At least I got a refund for one. Buy a different brand. These are not good.
1,Grabbed this as a backup but it will now be my primary hub for my 2020 Macbook Air. Nicely designed and with a flexible cable plus a free little carrying bag is a nice touch.Sadly this hub has trouble keeping disks mounted to my macbook air they eject sporadically - a problem I don't have with another usb-c hub using the same disks / sd-card. So I will not be using.
1,This doesn't provide anywhere need the allowed of a legit USB-C hub.
1,Returned
1,So sorry can’t leave a positive review. Item did not work with my Mac  Air 2021. Have to return:-(.
1,now working
4,thought to give this product a chance after a couple of other buys that were disappointing. I must say I have not had an issue so far. it connects every external device including my cd/dvd drive. so far I am super pleased.
5,Works very well. I use it with my MacBook Air and everything fits great. Good quality; makes it useful to use USB sticks with it as well. Multiple points too!
5,I used this with my new Mac Pro M2 because I need to use HDMI and a PC mouse. I love it because I can connect multiple devices at the same time. Super affordable yet the best!
5,This product works great with connecting all of my devices to my MacBook Pro 13"! I can connect and charge my phone and its super easy to connect any other devices I need to connect.
5,Just bought this to go with my new mac and it works great. Very versatile and useful when it comes to using ad-ons such as separate keyboards or mice.
5,We bought these for our school and the students love these. The macs we use don’t have usb and hdmi ports so this makes it seamless
5,very nice product. i used it on my apple computer. works very well. worth the amount of money.
5,This works great with MacBook pros to connect all the devices you could ever need!
5,works with my new school imac very good quality
5,This is an amazing product. It works so well
5,works with MacBook Pro MPXV2LL/A Laptop
1,Charging port does not work. Going to return.
5,Got this so I could have a place to plug in a flash drive and charge my phone for college. Works with the newest MacBook Pro (2338)
5,works perfectly and has not downside to it.
5,With the new 2020 Macbook Pro you need an adapter to go from USB C to USB SD HDMI etc.I received this as a gift from a friend and it works perfectly. It was just what I needed. It is small lightweight and well made.
5,Works amazingly with iPad Pro And Mac Studio works the same as the Anker one and save the extra $20 works flawlessly
5,I got this for a new Macbook Air to be able to use and HDMI plug for my TV.  I've been using it for a few weeks now and it seems to be working great.
5,I got this adapter for my birthday and i use it to connect a mouse to my phone and it works great  I love it
5,This fits nicely with my computer!!  Very easy to use.
5,Works great! No Issues at all.
5,Works well with our MacBook Pro it’s a great buy.
5,Works great with my Mac book pro!
5,Perfect adapter to use with my MacBook Pro.  Excellent quality and great price. Plug and play with no setup or software to install.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Compatible with MacBook Air 2020. Lights up to show its working. Came with a nice bag.
5,It’s woks with MacBook and LG monitor perfectly. Just like pic it can be used with multiple connection. Value for the money!
5,Bought specifically to insert on my iMac 24-inch M1 2021 for uploading photos from my CANON EOS 70D. So simple and efficient; easier than uploading my photo card directly into the back of my older iMac. As always Amazon is an amazing source for anything one ever needs!
5,Works with My Mac book Air seamlessly. I tested all the ports including the HDMI and they all seem to work as expected. Value for money.
5,My previous multiport had one major fault it lowered the speed with which my laptop charged. This one works perfectly I have no complaints.It has 1 HDMI port 1 USB C 2 USB B and 1 SD Card Port; which works perfectly for me: Monitor Charger Keyboard and Mouse.
5,Love this product works great with my 2021 MacBook Pro and on several TV’s in my house using the HDMI adapter port
5,This adaptor has all I needed and works well.
5,Was compatible with my dell elitebook
5,Very small profile and has more ports than standard adapters. Works with MacBook Pro.
5,I decided to give this one a try for my office and it did not disappoint. It actually adapted quickly from power on sleep mode and whatever I threw at it. It was able to pass the video from my laptop as well as charge a device when plugged in at the same time. This version is the matt finish and as I would say more industrial looking. It also has a smaller footprint so it is easier to fit in on the desk where space is at a premium. I would but another one.
5,Works well with MacBooks and has all the ports you'd need!
5,It works to connect my iMac with my onn 24” monitor via HDMI
5,This is the second dongle I've purchased and it is working the best so far. I would recommend it.
5,This product was great! The compatibility with my MacBook Pro (13-inch M1 2020) works. Would recommend using this product if you have this MacBook reference
5,It works for my needs so far.
5,This little device saves me from using the USB C Hub Adapter for MacBook Pro 2020 Multiport which has always been wobbly and not very secure when I move around or have things bump into it.This device can move and if it gets knocked around its great.
5,It sees my monitors(one at a time) and works as it should. Also it came with a little velvet pouch. It hits the price point. The only thing I would change is to make the little cable a bit more flexible. Very stiff. It bends though.
5,This little device has been great! It has all the ports we need for our Macbook Pro 2020 and then some. If you are thinking about buying this product do it!
5,I just received this and wow super easy to use and hooked up fast to my iPad Pro. No issues so far. Light weight and small enough to travel with.
5,works perfectly with steam deck
5,works really well with macbook pro and its really fast
5,Works well with MacBook Air (newest model)
5,The product works well with Macbook pro 13inch 2019. My old adaptor stopped working so I needed a replacement right away and luckily I was able to find this. It has everything I need in order to do my work. I was surprised at how small it was but I guess that means it's travel-sized. I did just pick this up so I'm going to avoid overloading the adaptor and probably have no more than two things plugged in just in case. It looks a bit cheap but that's what you get for the price. Hopefully it will do its job for a while. Overall I am happy with my purchase.
4,Works with MacBook Pro Chip M1
5,Work well on Macbook pro 2021. Provided with a small bag.
5,This B3 looks beautiful and it is charging my Mac also . Display quality is awesome even it does not get warm . I tested the SD card also and no issue with the speed .
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Las pocas veces que lo he usado hasta ahora ha funcionado bien pero el otro día la entrada para la tarjeta SD se conectaba y desconectaba. Al final conseguí que funcionase pero tuve ese pequeño problema.
5,good for extend monitor and card reader
5,I've used this with my MacBook Pro (13-inch M1 2020) and it works great!  I haven't tried ALL of the ports yet but the USB ports charging port and HDMI port all work well!  (I haven't had an opportunity to use the card readers.)  Overall great product!  Would definitely recommend it for newer MacBook users!
5,Un adaptador súper útil y bueno ya que cuenta con dos usb 3.0 que son mas avanzados y el detalle que te da. Una funda para poder guardarlos.Gracias excelente producido
5,All included ports in this dock work with Dell P-045352 Intel Core i7 1.80Ghz. It also works with Samsung Galaxy Note 10+
5,Recently replaced my MacBook Pro with a MacBook Air. I didn’t realize it doesn’t have any outlets. Bought this adapter to access my camera and external hard drive with my MacBook. Works great and has plenty of accessory points. My Macbook Air had no trouble discovering it and opened it immediately. Popped in my SD card and easily accessed my photos. The device is small which makes it easy to toss in a pocket of a backpack purse or laptop case. It’s really well made also.
5,Works great - the power throughput works and charges my laptop and the HDMI-out works and shows up on the monitor without any issues.
5,The product is very simple to use and exactly as described. I use with a Macbook Air which I purchased in 2020.
5,Not only are there many options to plug items in but it is also very compact and portable and comes in a duster carrier.
5,I purchased this adaptor to use in my MacBook Pro 2020 A2251 and works great
5,Using it with a Mac Studio for second monitor. Works great.
5,No problems at all.  Good value for the money and looks nice to boot.
5,I have macbook air 2021 and this item worked for me.Nice design and it has non-slip pad on the bottom of its body.
5,Works great love all the ports it has
5,The product is completely different than anything else available here very fast connection on USB and USB-C ports and the material quality is so good it feels like it is way more expensive than it actually is. Would 100% recommend.
5,It works with my Mac and windows very goodEasy to use and the aloof the money is off course is excellent
5,works with MacBook Air 2022 Model A2337
5,I got this and it is a great for my boys on their computer MacBook air! They love the sleek design!!
5,Great Product. Really enjoy this product. Got a great quality for the HDMI.
5,Love the convenience for the PC multiple ports to connect.
5,I have tried different ways to have double monitors connected to my laptop. This one works. One of my monitor was not HDMI output yet it still connects via an adapter.
5,This adapter is great I saved a lot of money because other stores sell for over $40 and it works perfectly. I use it on my 2020 MacBook Pro and can easily download straight from camera SIM cards and plug in hard drives all through this adapter. I am really happy with the results and they even include a little pouch for you to keep it safely stored. Great deal!
5,Works 100% with a Lenovo Thinkpad.If you need just one extra monitor and extra USB ports this is your product for a fair price.
5,Works great with my Dell XPS 13 9310 laptop
5,Works with my Macbook Air (2020). Small and sleek. Great value
5,Fast delivery works well with my MacBook Air 2020 (M1). Sleek design and has all the functionalities I need. Would recommend.
5,Works with Macbook Air M1 perfectly!
5,Works with Chromebook CB314-1H-C9XV and Nintendo Switch OLED version
5,I picked this up for a Samsung Galaxy S10 with a broken screen. The HDMI port let's me connect it to a monitor. The hub also let's me connect a keyboard mouse and power source. This device transformed my broken phone into a Chromebook using Samsung DeX. Thanks!
5,Easy to use.
4,Bought for reading SD card for gen 5 iPad Pro with M1 chip and it works.However it cannot work as a second display with iPad Pro only laptop can.
2,I purchased this hub to use with my new 2022 M2 MacBook Air. It connected to my tv via HDMI cable just fine. However when I tried to connect my SuperDrive using USB-A it would not power up. Unfortunately I am not very technically minded so perhaps I missed this information in the product description.
5,Great product. Bought to connect my imac monitor to a second monitor. Allows to connect my imac to practically anything
1,Used it 2 times only and it not working anymore
5,Works well with MacBook Air 2018 and has its own travel pouch to keep it dust free.
5,works with M1 macbook air. vert convenient for cs students.
5,Exactly what I expected. Works well.
2,Good size however if your laptop is placed on a computer stand (like mine) then its connection wire is too short.The usb-c channel does not work. The others seem to be okay.
5,Works well with mac/windows. good build quality . UBC / C / HDMI  all in one makes it perfect docking system
5,Delivered quickly and works well with my MacBook Pro
5,I use this with an ASUS ROG Strix Scar G773 on Windows 11. I just plugged in the device plugged my HDMI monitor keyboard Logitech Webcam and it works like a charm!
5,Easy to use plug and play used on s10 for a keyboard and mouse
5,Great product for a good price! Came fast and works perfectly with my MAC. I love it and recommend it to everyone
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 No issues so far and works fine with my MacBook air.
5,Worked fine on my MacBook Air M1 2020 and also on my iPad Air 4.Solid build small in size and light in weight.
