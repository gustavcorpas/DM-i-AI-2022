4,In case anyone is wondering what on earth is a Kimnix smart watch well it's a smart watch with a 1.72" screen that looks like a bigger size Apple smart watch but looks like a Apple smart watch knock off.I purchased two screen protectors for my watch this past April and one is already broke because I tried to take it off to clean around the edges. It broke when I did that. I have one left and wanted to purchase two more just in case my last one breaks.I went back to purchase the same two but they no longer have the 42mm size. It's 44mm and I don't know if that's too big. The 42mm size already was a bit difficult to take off but it protected my watch for a while.These two...they are pretty rugged which is why I gave it 4 stars but it didn't line up with the knob and the cover is too high up to where I can't access the touch screen. I would have to constantly take this off in order to get to the touch screen.I tried to take a picture to show the gap between the knob and where the screen is but my phone's camera kept blurring so this is what I could get. You could see the knob rubbing against the fitted hole and a gap where the watch should be pressing against the screen but don't.For people complaining about it not being water proof it's got cut outs so it won't cover the speaker...how could you not know it's not water proof???I wasted $14 on these screen protectors...If and when my Kimnix go out I will get a watch that will actually fit these but for now they don't work on a 1.72" 42mm screen that's only made for the Apple smart watch.
5,When I got my new SE watch my wife also gave me some watch protectors. Within a couple months both of those protectors broke. Yes they protected my watch but once they’re broke you need to replace them.I saw this version and it comes with 2 protectors so I figured why not try them!I’m 100% satisfied. Because the edges are made more like a phone case 1 of these protectors have already lasted longer than 2 cheaper versions and they look good as well.I would recommend and purchase these watch protectors again!
4,Initial reaction very positive. Good professional packaging installation instructions clear all necessary items included.  Installs very easily per instructions.  Major issues are: touchscreen unusable edges completely dead.  Side wheel and button not useable when watch is worn.  The case gets in the way.  These issues make the item of no value to me.  On a whim I tried the second cover.  Amazing this one worked well  50% is not acceptable.  I will be returning them as too expensive for just one useable item. Because one worked I updated my rating from 1 to 2After two weeks of use I must update my rating. Have changed from 2 to 4. My problem with the first one was OPERATOR ERROR. Teas was not fully down. I found that pushing all 4 corners firmly ensures a good install. Side buttons are useable once I became used to device. All in all this is a fantastic product. Again I stress that I do not get the watch wet so I have no information about clouding. I highly recommend this product.
5,I like this case a lot. It’s easy to install good quality/durable bumper. However it’s a little uncomfortable/can’t feel the side button. Other than that no complaints. I’m waiting for cases for Apple Ultra model.
5,Very durable and strong material.  The screen protector is nice and does a great job of protecting the screen.  The watch is made with strong material that does a great job of protecting the watch.  Recommend.  Great price too!
5,This thing is indestructible. I fell off a scooter going fast downhill and BROKE A BONE. All the damage the case suffered was a minor scuff. Apple watch completely intact not a single scratch. I lift weights at the gym on the daily and the thing is so strong that the glass has not ever shattered in over a year. I still have the 2nd case in the original box because it is so strong. An absolute tank of a case. Looks and feels good too. Slim enough to barely notice it.
4,Very nice and protective but not lasting I have a small lawn business and trimming and edging are a necessity and after a day of doing lawns I’ve noticed the screens broke went through both in 2 weeks would love them if they were a bit tougher
4,needed a cover to protect while working in a body shop I'm a bit hard on the equipment. Saved the watch more than once.
5,Precise cutouts. Excellently fit and super easy to install. Great value for money
5,I have been getting these for years and having other people buy them as well. Very sharp looking for a cover and very durable. Save your screen and a hefty repair cost by buying these!!!! Don’t make a dumb mistake and ruin your watch.
4,Good for what it’s meant for. Only gripe is if you’re sweating during cardio/exercise/etc. you’ll accumulate a sweat puddle in between the screen protector and physical watch face but I always just take it off wipe it down and reinstall. Nbd.
5,I love the look ease of taking it on and off and the durability. I have had other iWatch protection products this one is the best for the money by far.
5,All you have to do is take it off and wipe it every once in a while
5,Love this case on my watch it’s durable strong and protects the entire Watch. I’ve scraped my watch on the concrete and immediately checked to see if my watch was ok and the case barely had a nick in it
4,This is a great case and it’s very durable. Only downside is that it does impede the user from turning the crown of the watch at times.
5,I liked how it covers my whole watch that it came with two different colors and that the screen on it was glass. I definitely recommend this to everyone.
5,I haul gas for a living so I’m always bumping into stuff with my hands and the cover has held up really good the regular covers lasted a day each this has made it over 2 weeks not even a scratch yet!!
5,Perfect.
4,The product works as advertised well worth the price..
3,Clips easy.  Easy to remove.  As other reviewers noted moisture does condense on the underside of the glass if in a hot humid environment and you are sweating.  This does make the touch difficult.  The protector needs to be removed wiped clean...along with watch face...and replaced.  I am finding that after a couple of months in the deep south the underside is getting more difficult to clean and starting to show some dirtiness but not that noticeable.  This is why a dropped the "Touch screen" down to 3 stars.When not sweating and the face stays  dry the touch response is great and does not hinder the reading of the watch display at all.
5,Have tried a number of Apple Watch covers and these are far and away the best. They are durable and easy to install while giving your watch a much more rugged look. The only downside was iffy touch sensitivity once wet but that’s to be expected with any cover. Very happy with these!
5,My husband works construction dirty and rough outdoor job these work wonders! He gets it wet and dirty and his apple watch is perfectly fine. Buying more!
5,The rugged case is amazing. I work warehouse and it has save my watch plenty of times. Definitely recommend!
5,It was pretty simple to install. The colors is great! Also it’s probably the slimmest heavy duty cover you can get. The touch screen is a little difficult to get just because it’s kinda thick but you just press a little harder. By far it’s better than others I’ve tried but just be sure to press harder than what you’re used to.
5,Look great and definitely hold up better than the less expensive snap on covers (which i ended up replacing every week practically).
5,Works great easy to put on and take off
4,This is a very chunky cover with a very definite sporty look. I use it while traveling but not day-to-day because it makes it too difficult to access haptic actions on the watch.
4,My wrist strap is a Milanese Loop so it is much thicker on one end where it meets the case. This made that end separate (lift) off the watch face a little requiring a bit more force to get a touch to register.Other than that it has done a great job.
5,I bought this screen protector right after getting my Apple Watch as a gift. I was reluctant to even get the watch because I’m notoriously hard on them and I was afraid I’d ruin it so when my wife bought me one I wanted to protect it. I chose this protector in particular because it has a small raised ridge all the way around that keeps most things from scraping across the screen I’ve ruined several watch crystals that way.  I’ve had this on my watch for 8 months now. It was super easy to install I’ve never had any trouble using the touch screen functions and any time I pop it off my watch screen underneath is still pristine. I do remove it occasionally to clear out any dust that gets under it. I work in a very dusty environment and the screen protector just pops on and off it doesn’t actually stick to the screen. I finally lost the one I’ve been using for 8 months. It snaps on securely so my best guess is that I somehow snagged it and popped it off while putting a coat on. I pulled the second one out of the package to replace it then immediately ordered another set to keep as spares. I really can’t recommend these enough.Side note- because these snap over and around the watch itself they will make your watch look a bit bigger. That might be a concern if you have small wrists and don’t like that look.
5,Dura y es fuerte  un buen producto
5,Tempered glass fit perfectly looks amazing! What’s not to like?
5,Protects my Apple Watch SE great and it’s not bulky at all. Definitely worth the buy.
4,Fit is good sturdy and easy on and off this last is important because water easily gets trap between case and watch so every now and then need to remove and dry/clean it really helps that you can remove case easily last one I had broke while removing it to clean
3,Looks good and good protection and easy to install but the one area it won’t let me touch screen is bottom right where the mic button is for texting. I took it off.
5,These cases held on a lot longer the previous ones I’ve purchased.
5,Fits easy awesome protection
5,The only down side to these units is touch screen items in corners can sometimes be hard to activate but that is very acceptable considering the protection that they provide. Other covers that i have bought have cracked with days of using them. so far 3 weeks and not. scratch.
4,It’s a good product if you want to protect your watch but be advised from time to time do you have to take it off and wipe it out due to moisture or humidity or do in the air that’s the only downfall I see to this product
3,the adhesive to the screen does not last very long but its not necessary to continue in using the product. 98% still effective. The touch screen will not work properly with the case on if the watch is wet i.e if you're recording swimming laps showering the touch screen will not work. But easy fix is to remove the case while doing swimming laps and just put the case back on afterwards. I have bumped my watch with the case on and the case has very good durability in that sense of not breaking apart after running your wrist into a wall stair rail etc.
5,Buy it!! You won’t b disappointed.  Durable n worth the money.
3,A few months ago I bought one of these and wrote a review on this same issue. Very commendably the manufacturer must have read my review and sent 2 new ones at no charge. One didn’t fit tight enough at all to make the touch work. The other one has to be tweaked every day or more often. I check my heart rate on my Apple Watch and it almost never works without removing this squeezing it to try to make it fit tighter and replacing it. It’s great protection and looks good. I had one a couple years ago that worked great. That’s why I reordered the same thing. I’m disappointed that it doesn’t work better.
5,It’s not scratch resistant. I took it off because of condensation from sweating & let dry & cleaned it with a qtip & it scratched it. Not military grade like advertised.
3,Love the looks and everything about it but it pops off very easily/ have to dry out water every time I wash dishes or my hands
4,I like that this product gives the watch a facelift. The glass is strong and allows you to touch your screen with ease. However I was at the gym and noticed that there was a lot of condensation build-up between the glass and the watch. I went to adjust my workout and it wasn't working. It's like if you have water on your iPhone screen and nothing will slide. I didn't think about sweat getting between the screen so I'll take it off when at the gym.
3,Attractive fit and rugged protection. I also like that there's no intrusive text and branding. But if you're going to do anything that involves water or sweat the phone can become inoperable. The protective glass does not adhere to the watch's face so condensation and moisture seep in between the glass protector and the watch's face. I'm writing this off and trying another solution.
5,My husband remodels. This is a nice sturdy cover to protect his  Iwatch while he works..
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I work in construction in the mud and this has lasted 8 months so far and I’m still on the first one. It is a great price and holds up well.
4,Screen doesn't respond to touch easily sometimes. Water gets under the case very easily which also affects responsiveness of the watch. But overall it works great.
5,So far haven't had any issues. I will be buying more when needed. Update I also wore it in the shower and unlike the screen protector I got at Walmart the water doing get underneath the protector. Once again great job guys.
5,This case looks really good on watch and wrist.  I’m satisfied. It’s durable to the max and  Touch screen is flawless with screen protector on..  there’s only one draw back though….  So since the screen protector isn’t flush to the screen itself  water gets inside when taking a bath or shower but  The good thing about this flaw is that the case is very easy to take off and very easy to put back on  so if you Can look past this issue (like I have) then this case is for you.  What I do is after a shower  I easily remove the case dry the inside of the case and the watch screen then easily put the case back on the watch.  Or to avoid this easy process you can  Just take the watch off before  you bathe.  My opinion is that This case is good enough to overlook that minor issue.  Hope this helps ;)))
5,I liked that this watch case has held up the outdoor demands of my job… As well as it was simple to install it to my watch…
5,I would never have thought this product would hold up to the abuse but man has it ever. And it fits perfectly over my watch and is easy to clean well worth the money
5,Great quality.
5,It’s easy to install no bubbles on the screen great quality and it seems that will protect my watch. I’m a OT so I’m definitely hands on… I was looking for something easy to disinfect and this protector looks like everything I was looking for!
3,Along the edges of the screen the touch screen unresponsive and when I try to pay with apple the button doesn’t work. So if I want to use Apple Pay I have to remove the case.
5,Because it’s so rugged it’s tough to get in and off. But that’s what I wanted my screen protected. If it gets damp it’s hard to access.
5,So far so good really protects the face of my watch
4,Overall a very nice case but you should consider the following before purchasing:1. The glass from the case is not sealed against your watch screen. Water and dust get in between which to me is a nuisance.2. The case is thick and it hard to turn the dial (e.g. hard to turn dial enough to activate the water repelling function on the watch).Other than the above the case is great in terms of fit look and durability.
3,It makes your Apple Watch stick out like a sore thumb. It can also irritate your wrist as it adds plastic not only above but below the watch as well.It is NOT comfortable to sleep with so if you sleep with your watch like I do…don’t do it.Touch screen is okay with some issues if you tend to use a light touch.Overall I would not buy this again as it just makes the once slim watch into a large sloppy painful mess. But will it protect your watch?Yeah for it’s ungodly size it better…
5,So far they are good the first set went to someone else hopefully they liked them but customer service hooked me up and so far so good
5,Takes less than a minute to put onto the watch. Excellent protective screen and barrier. Very durable. Touch screen easily responds to use. Definitely recommend and will buy again.
4,This product is very durable and is of great quality! Although it is a screen protector it does lower the display resolution and make the watch interface look a bit washed out. Aside from the lowered resolution the watch face is free from scratches and is protected well!
5,Easy to install no hassle great product.
3,The cover is nice and functional however the white doesn't stay white.  The white fades like an old t-shirt's armpits after a few years.  Bummed
5,I wore my Series 7 to work for almost 3 months without a case but now I’ll never wear it without one again. This case is super easy to install and so far very durable. I haven’t had problems with the touch screen reacting differently yet and don’t anticipate it happening. If you’re looking for a good case that will protect your watch from damage then this is a very affordable and good looking option.
5,The protector is rugged & durable. But my favorite aspect is the aesthetic. It makes your Apple Watch look like a piece of military equipment. Other cases I’ve used in the past are 100% tempered glass all around & I usually ruined them by hitting the edge or corners of the protector which would cause them to crack. This design eliminates that issue without compromising the overall protection. In my opinion this is the best value to many of the other options
3,The case is nice and durable but the screen portion is not as responsive as it should be and gets moisture in it very easily. If i work outside or sweat from working the screen instantly fogs up and have to remove case and clean it then reinstall. Has happened on numerous occasions.  Easy to take on and off.
5,I can’t thank this company enough … I have a very physical job and this case saved my watch today!!
5,Sturdy
3,The first screen broke while cleaning lightly with a micro fiber cloth. The second screen came loose the first time I removed and cleaned. I emailed the company months ago with no response.
4,Easy to install
5,Keep up the great work!
5,Looks and feels indestructible. The cover does interfere a bit with the crown. Takes some getting used to. Definitely feel much better about wearing my watch.
5,I always knock my wrist against walls etc.  this protect that.  Easy to take off and on.  Firm material.  Recommend
5,Like
5,La funda es de fácil montaje y desmontaje protege bien el reloj de los golpes y arañazos. Pero no es para impedir que ingrese el agua o el polvo o si estás haciendo ejercicio se empañe la pantalla esto es por el mismo hecho que se desmonta y la superficie de la funda es recta no es como la pantalla en los extremos que es curva declinable.
5,So far I have had this cover on my watch for a year. It has protected my watch several times. A must-have.
5,This case for the apple watch is pretty good! It covers the whole watch (other than the bottom ofc) and protects it from scratches and bumps. The only thing that sucks is that the case does not work with the apple bands. I have the Nike Sport Loop and when I put on the case it restricts the movement of the loop band making it hard to take off of my wrist. Luckily I do have the regular Nike Sport Bands as well which work fine with the case.
5,It took less than a minute to snap on and it is very durable. It protects my watch especially when I am working around the house and mostly outside in my yard.  Excellent protection for your watch and looks great as well.
5,Love this case so far. The last one I had started to peel.
3,Like the sturdiness however it doesn’t seat all of the way which makes it impossible to use the touch screen
4,These things offer great protection but they are bulky and ugly.  They are very masculine in that they resemble some sort of tactical armor but they are not pretty.  I have used other screen protectors that are more sleek and contour the Apple watch more closely but those shattered so easily and when they did shatter I had no idea when or how it happened.  This item however is still intact and doing it's job well after months.
5,Absolutely love the product!! Bought two different brands before this one and they broke with in a week or so and this one has lasts for months.
4,Touch sensitivity is fine except in one extreme far corner…when compared to less rugged watch protectors.  But the more rugged design and extra protection more than makes up for this minor issue
5,I’m a mechanic I use these and still the only way I’ve broke one is putting too much pressure cleaning it but they’ve held up to chemicals and bashing it into things at work
5,Fits great and offers plenty of protection.
4,Works good looks little bulky
2,They both installed fine. I tried the green on first and had no problems but then I got a new band in so I switched to black. The black one has a thicker screen protector. I had to press ridiculous hard for my watch to register any input.Switching to a different brand's clear protector fixed this problem.One other issue was the right side button extension feels stiff. It works but it makes pressing the function button a bit more of a chore.
5,Very touch!
5,I wish I would have found these sooner! Such a great product! Couldn’t be more happy with the purchase!
5,My husband needed a heavy duty watch protector because of his job (he’s a mechanic). This is it! Easy to install and the rubber bumper edges really protect from impact and being knocked around. These are great!
5,The item works and fits like a charm
3,These look good but unfortunately they are built like gas station lighters.
4,This screen protector has definitely helped keep my Apple Watch Series 6 in great shape. However moisture does get stuck underneath the temper glass so you'll have to take it off frequently to wipe the underside of the glass and the screen of the watch. It is a bit difficult to remove the case protector and it did end up scratching the side of the my watch :(
5,It was durable easy to install its cool!
5,This is the third style of Apple Watch covers I have bought.  Finally found ones that are tough enough!  These stay secured way better then any others I have used.  The ONLY issue with them is when swimming or showering.  Water gets underneath so you need to remove to dry out.
4,I wanted to love this but it doesn’t work well with the bands I prefer to wear. The touchscreen is more responsive than others I’ve had and it seems really durable but I can’t expand my sport loop band. Luckily my wrist and hands are really small and I can still get my watch on.
5,5/5 I would buy again
4,Fits nice
5,It’s what I ordered thank you.
4,I liked that the product installed easily protected the watch and looked pretty good. However I did find it more susceptible to retaining water under the glass protector sitting on the screen. It will spread a tiny droplet almost across the entire screen rendering the touchscreen useless. This is easily fixed by removing and using microfiber inside and out. But I did use a clear tpu and glass case for same 40mm watch that did better moving water out from under the screen and retained touchscreen functionality in and around water.
3,The images sort of made these appear to be metallic but they’re just regular ol’ plastic and though they (the one I have used) offer protection and don’t impede the touchscreen or overall usability of the watch I wouldn’t repurchase. Shoulda read a bit more but with the time remaining to have delivered asap I neglected to read the details thoroughly. My bad not the seller’s.
3,Update: After a few months of using the case I’m not as happy as I initially was. When the case was new the screen protector did seal to the watch face but lost the ability to seal not long after - probably a week or two. Water gets trapped between the case and the screen but even when there is no water under the case I can barely use my watch at times. The watch cannot register my touch and I have to tap the screen a bunch of times to even use it. It still protects my watch well but makes using the watch a pain at times. Due to this I have lowered my review from 5 stars to 3.Love this case! It’s lightweight but feels rugged and durable! I had a case that popped off my watch so easily and I lost it. This case fits snuggly and is comfortable to wear. The installation was easy and the package came with everything I needed.
3,This item although covers your watch is bulky looking and feeling and also if wearing it while swimming or showering water seeps in between your watch face and cover.
5,I don’t do a lot of reviews. But today I took a 2x10x14 piece of lumber to the chest and arm  it absolutely shattered my watch case but not an ounce of harm was done to the watch. I never thought that the case was actually glass but I found out today that the face of the case IS glass. This thing saved my watch without a doubt in my mind I’d be replacing the whole watch instead of the case if it hadn’t had this case on it. 10/10
5,Rugged easily installed screen protector. Only downside is accumulation of moisture between screen and protector. Be prepared to remove protector clean and dry before reinstalling.
3,I like the protection this piece provides around my watch. However it is difficult to hit icons in the corners  of the screen such as; send and the microphone for spoken texting. Most concerning is the fact that the piece causes condensation to form and sit between its protective lens and the face of the watch. The condensation affects the visibility of the watch face.
5,Water and dust gets inside of the screen protector very easily.. but it is durable and prevents scratches. Washed my hair and it was full of water.. but it wiped dry.Update… I had to post this update because at first I was upset that it broke so easily…But I’m super glad I purchased it. My daughter fell playing basketball and the glass shattered…but her Apple Watch didn’t have a scratch on it!!! So all in all…it did it’s job!!! therefore I have to raise the score on this one and order another one. Super satisfied with the protection it provided! Just wish there were more color options lol
2,It gets condensation under the screen as soon as you walk outside from being inside the AC. It takes minutes sometimes to go away and sometimes it takes hours. The case looks cool and protect from dings bumps mild scratches. Other than that it's not a show stopper.
5,grandson is happy
5,Very easy to attach and doesn't affect the touch screen at all. I have a tendency of moving arms hands when talking and hitting thing while doing so.
3,Looks cheap.
4,I had been ramming my Apple Watch into anything and everything like everyone else does. Then one day I’m thinking you keep smacking a 700$ device into the wall all the time maybe you should protect it. So I got this. It’s perfect though material that can take a beating. It comes in a two pack so your covered if you lose one or break it somehow. The only negative is that it adds some bulk to the watch. I’ma big guy so it doesn’t look too bad but for your average person it might be extra noticeable.
3,If you get water on the watch while wearing the cover it gets under the cover and you have to remove it to air dry it. After a few months use the screen cracked.
3,Not great but not bad. Just don’t like dust and dirty between the screen and screen protector.
3,Sort of pointless product. Lol maybe mine is defective? But I am unable to use the touch screen with this protector on. I still use it for protection when I really need it but if I want to use it i have to take it off.
5,Case performs as expected good watch protection
4,I love how the product doesn’t make my watch super bulky. it was super easy to install as well. the only thing is when i am clearing out my apps i have to double tap on the x to close it so the touch screen was a little wonky on that
4,My job tends to be a bit rough sometimes. This protector took a hit that would have shattered my Apple Watch. Far better to replace this than to buy a new watch. Well worth every penny.
4,I've had others in the past and none of them seemed to work well with the touch screen. This case is Absolutely worth to purchase. Works well with ti=ouch & dials Of course if you go swimming or get it soaked water will get in between screens no big deal just remove dry and reinstall. Other than that small issue Great product!!
3,The colors on the watch case are great however it does not remove once applied to the watch very easily. I end up having to put my thumb on the screen to pry it off which feels like I’m going to snap it in half. And I have to remove the case to charge my watch on my stand. Overall just for looks the case is great. Functionality wise is not the best I’ve had.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Everything was easy to install and very durable and rugged.
5,About 15 dollars for a couple of protectors seems very inexpensive but I have seen friends with similar ones bought for 11 a pair one for 7 bucks. In any case they feel great and add little bulk to the watch. I have a really big hand and the 42mm Apple Watch 3 feels small so this helps a lot.
5,Durable with good looks.
4,Its a excellent piece of case for your watch if you work insides because with my experience the screen kinda pops up when it exposes to heat and make it hard to use the touch screen. but it resolves when I'm inside for some reason. Can't complain overall a good product. I'd rather use it inside than outside work.
5,Really nice and adds charm to the watch! Very durable so far.
5,Haven’t had any touch screen issues since I’ve gotten the case and it snaps on quickly. Nice product
5,This is the only watch cover I’ve had that actually stays on. I did crack the screen protector on one of them but I also am very rough on my watch. The screen on my watch has no cracks or scratches so it definitely keeps it protected. I liked this cover so much I actually ordered a set for my mom for Christmas
2,Ok for the most part… Except at times I have to tap certain corners multiple times before it does the command.  As it turns out I had to press the corners of this bumper case even more so it can touch the glass screen of the watch inside.  The white case stains underneath which is a no no for me.
5,This is the second time i purchased this series 3 38mm case. First one i got was from a different seller. I chose this one because it comes with 2 instead of one with the same price. The case is good give it a rugged look to it. I’m a welder so i mostly just want to keep dusts away from the watch screen. But I highly doubt the glass is durable enough if you accidentally hit it hard. But for normal uses is perfectly fine. I recommend it.
5,Very very good case for my Apple Watch
5,Great protection
4,The product has a great design to it. I love the durability and stable edges it has. It’s definitely reliable on your wrist for a Apple product that is great but easily can get damaged. The touch screen has only 1 issue that I noticed. The issue is the fingerprints.
5,I have a lot of great things to say about this Apple Watch case. It is light weight durable great protection all around sensitivity is great and it looks amazing on the Apple Watch! When I first got it I was really hoping for a good sensitivity touch because my previous case was a bust it didn’t function well. It was time to get a new case with better handling sensitivity. I ordered this one and was not disappointed most definitely recommend it looks great and it feels great and you get 2 for the price of 1! It was easy to install just by simply clipping it in!
5,These little things are pretty solid! I wear my watch everyday and I wake up knowing that this thing is going to keep my watch in 1 piece! It may not prevent dust and or water from getting to my watch but it more than serves its purpose!
5,Ordered one day and it arrived the next. Didn’t realize there are two in the package. Easy to install. Durability? Time will tell.
4,Easy to install. Works well. However after about a week or so I looked down at my watch and it was gone. I probably whacked it in something while working and popped it off so I guess it worked in that regard because watch was fine.
3,The protection is good and it looks nice but. When yo try to touch the things that are not on the center of the screen you have to put much more force to get it to work. Additionally  swiping up and swiping down does not work at all because the edges of the built in screen protector does not make proper contact with the apple watch screen.
3,It’s a very nice cover for your watch. The piece snaps on easy looks sleek and I’m sure has saved my screen a couple times. However I have persistent problems with it falling off of the face of my watch. If you don’t do very much physical activity or are in a pretty moderate profession regarding activity this is the perfect watch case for you!
5,This very good and solid I really like it.
5,Great product and has very good durability good for engineers and hard workers when on the job! My husband is a pool builder and he loves it!
5,Good solid case. The glass is smooth and I like how flat it makes the overall surface. Clips in easily and both sides of glass come with film protection on it.
3,Looks good makes screen hard to use
5,I bought these covers for my new Apple Watch SE. What impressed me most was the fact that they fit the watch perfectly. The dial and microphone port line up exactly as they should.What also impressed me was the fact that they included cleaning wipes in the packaging. It was very easy to install and the fit on the screen was perfect. No dust or gaps that affected how the cover interfaces with the touch screen. The attention to detail is remarkable!If you want a great rugged cover for your Apple Watch SE look no further!
5,It has saved my watch daily
5,I love it so much I'm going to order so more right now
5,Awesome cases I would definitely order again for any more there watch
5,This case was perfect for me. I’m clumsy and hit my wrists on everything especially when I’m wearing a watch. My watch already had a few good scratches on it so I wanted something to protect it some but not change the function of the watch.This case is very easy to put on/take off. It’s durable and protects the entirety of the exposed section of the watch. It has a good rugged look to it and snaps on regardless of the watch band being used. Highly recommend. I would have paid the same price for a single case - but now I have a back up.
5,Good product
4,It’s easy to put on and take off great with impact protection. Just let’s moisture in between it and the watch
5,Very durable and protects to boot
5,Add a good layer of protection the watch
5,Love when something is exact what you want a need; no worries about my watch in this bad boy and that’s a huge one! Thanks for the quality product!
5,Was looking for a case to put on my watch for when I lift. This thing is tough and definitely saved my watch many times. Worth the money.
5,I wanted a little more rugged look to my Apple Watch as well as protection for the entire watch not just the screen. It’s easy to install and does exactly what I needed.
5,Everything works great!
4,The product does what is advertised for: protection. I have the Apple nylon strap and the casing somewhat interferes with the strap when adjusting especially when it gets to the velcro.
5,Adds a little size and square edges to the watch which I like. My previous cover kept getting moisture inside from working out and hand washing. Had this one for several months and zero moisture!
5,I am very pleased with these combination screen and watch case protectors!  Since I originally purchased my 42mm Series 3 Apple Watch I have used a rubber-lined metal case-edge protector and various brands of separate screen protectors.  The standalone screen protectors have worked but have ALL had problems with bubbling and impact resistance.  These new “unitized construction” combination screen saver/case rim protector have proven to meet both of the objectives easily and durably!  Installation is literally a “SNAP” and I have experienced ZERO problems with screen visibility touch screen sensitivity or dust resistance despite my active life style!
5,Best case to date that I have bought for an Apple Watch
3,It says "Rugged" in the title but this happened after just 3 days of use.  And the worst part about it is that I can't even say I was doing anything particularly strenuous or hitting the watch on anything.  I went out for a morning jog can't remember bumping it on anything so if I did it couldn't have been that strong.  When I got home I looked at my watch to see how far I'd run and... watch face cracked?!?  I'm not saying it couldn't have been a fluke but I expected more than 3 days usage out of one cover.Otherwise I liked everything else about it up until that point.
2,Product sits on my watch face but there is a slight gap so I cannot access the entire screen of my watch. And because of this gap it traps moisture when I wash my hands.
4,Its an okey product..
5,Excellent protection
4,We like it so far but just seeing how long it will last compared to other will be what sells us in the long run.
3,Let’s Water in every time I wash my hands it’s a beautiful case I just don’t like having to take it off and wipe the inside dry from having to wash my hands all the time my wife completely took it off she doesn’t even wear hers anymore for that exact reason it just sits in her purse but I still have hope for it !  It’s nice and bulky and very durable heck I’ve even fallen on top of the watch before and it held up nicely I like it my wife doesn’t
5,Not to bad actually.
5,The media could not be loaded.
5,Me gusto mucho es resistente queda perfecto funciona la pantalla
4,Best case ever for my watch.
5,
5,I like it
5,Fit watch well.  Good screen protection.  Excellent product for cost.
5,was very easy to install on watch. I have hit my watch on a few things while walking and had no damage.
5,A Saved my husband’s watch screen when a tool let loose and hit the screen. Was thrilled to see no damage to the watch after the cover was removed!
5,Most of all this case is very rugged. Easy to install and take off. Now my watch is safe from scratches while working in construction. Will buy more
4,Love this case… however the white case that comes with it stains very easily.
5,Got for my son and I we both love it!
5,I bought this case to replace my bulky Rhino case. It’s fantastic. It has a nice sturdy feel and keeps the water out for the most part in spite of not fully enclosing the watch. It’s a little tough to remove the watch from but that lends to its sturdiness. I recommend wearing with a nylon NATO-style band for a good look.
5,This cover is awesome. I purchased it for my husband who loves to wear his Apple Watch but works in an industry where things can easily be broken. He has done all his usual work and this case stands the test of durability. It’s easy to put on and it matches his band just fine. I will be buying a couple more just to have on hand as well as to use on my son’s watches because they are pretty rough as well!
5,My watch is actually black but with this screen protector and my own white band I’m able to wear it as a white watch which is pretty neat in terms of changing the aesthetics of the watch. The touchscreen works great and it provides nice protection of the screen for a really great price. Came with little wipes to remove dust before installation. Really can’t beat the price and quality
5,This bumper/ screen is the best thing I have ever purchased! Details- Series 3 Apple Watch 42 mm.I have paid much higher for a bumper case that that popped off after three days of use. I’m guessing it’s with all the lost dryer socks. If your going for fancy or yacht rock looks this ain’t it. It’s durable touch screen works great and it will not pop off of your watch.  Solid purchase.
3,I often have difficulty utilizing buttons towards the edges of the screen.  The plastic feels cheap compared to other brands
4,Good product
5,Great fit it does get moisture underneath but easy to remove and clean. I would recommend.
2,I dropped my watch and the rim of the case cracked. My watch was okay but it was about a 4 foot drop. This "protective case" isn't really the most durable. The second of the two pack has a scratch on it and how it got there is a mystery.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Easy to install. Extremely rugged. Would recommend this to any other mechanic out there. Touch sensitivity around the edges is poor.
5,Love this product. It can be a bit bulky though.
2,No me agrada porque el reloj se humedece cuando me da calor y tengo el reloj puesto
3,Slides on easy is very rigid but moisture gets under the screen and affects the usability so I find that I can't use it in the gym where I wanted to use it but I can keep it on all day outside of the gym.
4,Great overall but a bit bulky for women.
3,These seem ok. My husband wore one for about 3 weeks and the first one spontaneously cracked (they are glass). So the one he is using now seems to mess with the crown when he is wearing it. It will stop a workout timer or change from one thing to another.
5,Good durable just what I wanted. Stays on well and pretty durable
5,Love them fit perfect and definitely have been protecting my watch from anything my swinging arm throws at it
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 1. It was easy to install.2. durable Plastic: I accidentally ran it over with my truckAnd it survived with a minor crack. Granted! I have a big A$$ truck.3. It gives it a bolder look.
5,The best apple watch case out there hands down!
4,LOVE ❤️ IT WILL BUY AGAIN
5,These cases are awesome for the price. SUPER easy to snap on and the screen protector comes with a screen cover sticker on both sides so the screen protector goes on completely clean. This sounds like a silly thing to get hyped about but I have two dogs and am perpetually pulling dog hair out of cases so this was awesome
2,Water leaked in to watch when washing dishes. I didn’t expect water to leak in so quickly. Had to remove immediately to avoid damage to Apple Watch.
5,Impressed by the Quality! Will buy again!
5,easy on easy off works great very protective.
5,Very durable
4,Good deal for the price
5,Snaps on easy and touch screen works well
5,This is an awesome product!!!
5,Looks good and seems durable. I like that I can change the color and that the screen is protected.
5,They look amazing on your watch and work as well as expected. Glad I purchased these.
5,Matches well with white apple band that comes with watch
5,
1,1. The picture online is completely false compared to what i recieved. I asked for green color i recieved 2 piano black cases.2. The size is what seems for the smaller apple watch it would not install and even if it would it would cover a good amount of the screen.
3,I’ve only had the cover for a couple days so I can’t really comment on usability or durability but right now it’s protecting my watch. I’ll check back at a later date after using a while. But so far I like it.
3,This snapped on great and I think it is good protection for the watch but I am unable to press the side button in and i have to be at the right angle to rotate the crown. Also the screen partialy sticks to the wathc face showing what look like air bubbles. It does it's job I guess.
2,Easy to install and still able to use touch screen without issues while still providing protection not bulky.
2,These cases fog up if you do some moderate activity and sweat
5,I’d always wanted to make my Apple Watch a bit more rugged looking while also protecting it and I couldn’t have found a better option! Case is super durable and I’ve had a few people ask me what kind of smart watch it was not knowing it was an Apple Watch!
5,Love it!! Gives me a piece of mind that My I watch is fully protected!!
5,The first time I got it one cracked very easily while installing with a quick movement but I have had a replacement now for about a month and they are amazing!
5,I replaced my old cover with this and its perfect. I love it. It protects my watch against any rubbing. So far so good!
5,Great product fits perfect
5,Fit perfectly very durable. I have had these on 2 different watches and have never cracked a screen.  Highly recommend
5,Fits and works great. It has saved my watch already. Only complaint is that I wish there was a way to keep water from getting between protector and watch screen.  Easy enough to remove and dry when ( not if ) it does.
5,Super easy to install the touch screen works without issue and so far it has held up great!  That makes me a happy camper :)
4,Easy to put on.
5,Cover snaps on and fits fantastically. I work in the food business and have to wash my hands often I have had trouble with water or condensation collecting in other covers. I have not had any moisture invasions with these covers. They fit tight and look nice.
2,Touchscreen doesn’t work well
2,I would not recommend this if you move a lot or do a lot of hands on physical work if you sit around not doing anything or an easy job get it but as a picker at Amazon and I’m always lifting boxes all shapes and sizes and putting my arms in awkward positions anyways I was working and it just popped off causing me to have to remove my watch so I don’t bang it and crack it while working so the next day I put my other one on and again it popped off and lost it in a VNA asile 😢 whats also annoying is that the screen protector is attached to the case so Now Im gonna have to buy a screen protector and a case for my watch I will not be buying this again 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
2,Seems well built and protects the watch however there is a small amount of the screen that you can’t access when this is on. It makes it hard to swap between watch faces because you can’t access the edges easily. Secondly I had to use a  dremel to make the cut out a little bigger so I could use the crown. The hole for the crown is too small and doesn’t allow you to push or turn the crown.
2,I was really excited for these covers because I loved the look of them. The initial application process was super easy and they look great. But unfortunately I can’t even use my watch because the screen won’t pick up my fingers through the screen protector. I tried both covers and I have to push down very hard to even use my watch. Plus my digital crown(dial on side) won’t move without a lot of force with the case on. Unfortunately I will be returning them.
5,
2,Touch does not work and water between the screen and the case. then you have to remove the case to take out the water.
5,Very sturdy.  So easy to put on unlike the soft rubber ones I have used before.
3,Seems to work well I got the blue and black shells. I was going to use the blue shell but I broke the glass on it by accident while installing. Protects the body of the watch good though. Can get fogged up some in high humidity.
1,I actually returned this item.  It is very easy to install touch screen is good and it will protect your watch to an extent.  The issue is condensation between the case and the watch.  I give it a 3 on all factors but gave it one due to condensation issue- I would look at other products.
3,Good product other than anytime my watch gets even remotely wet water gets trapped between the screen and case. This happens every time. Rather annoying to take off and wipe clean every single time.
5,I like everything about it!
3,When water gets between the screen you have to take it apart and water gets under there easily
5,Add extra protection for the screen touch is not diminished.
2,Touchscreen not responding
5,Best screen protectors and a good deal for two! Thought they’d look too rugged for my taste but it turns out they remind me of the g-shock watch style and I’m in love with the look! Definitely recommend!
2,It’s nice but the touch screen doesn’t work that well. if it wasn’t for that I’d be happy with it
5,Needed this to protect my apple watch screen. Works as designed
5,44mm….Quick install. All buttons are easily accessible. Great look.
5,Great product very durable
1,The pros to this is that it it protects the actual screen. However once hands are being washed liquid comes in the screen making it difficult to operate the touch screen.
2,Any moisture pools under and looks like a stain. Washing your hands is enough. These are not worth buying imo
2,Glass broke the first day
3,The rugged case I had before these. Stayed on better these pop off with the drop of a hat! Displeases
5,Excellent case! Extremely easy to pop on and off.  Feels very sturdy. The Built in screen protector works well to the touch. It doesn’t even look like you have an extra screen! Excellent value!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Yes is a nice look good on my watch I hope the screen is for long term easy to install no problem thank you 👌
5,Muy fácil de instalar y duradero
2,Likes: Looks good and does well protecting the watch from bumps and thumps. Dislikes: Hard case keeps the side button from rotating. Moisture ( sweat water etc. ) gets underneath making the touch screen not work. Working out with it on is frustrating having to take it off to clean it while training.
5,Good quality and will definitely protect your Apple Watch.
2,I found the case to be too bulky where my sleeve end keeps catching.Also the touch surface is insensitive on the right side even though it is completely flush.The crown is much more difficult to operate.Returned and on the hunt for something better. Maybe just a screen protector is in my future?
5,I got the black and blue pack because my watch is dark grey and they both look fantastic. Material is rough so I can trust it with protecting the watch just fine.
3,Nice cases one arrived broken which is why I rated it low. The non broken one holds up pretty well. Nice tight fit. Nice feel.
5,Its been a week and this iwatch protector has lived up to some brutal tests. You can see the screen crystal clear and it was a snap putting it on the watch.
5,This case is a perfect fit! Give the most protection while also being slim and not too bulky. Snaps into place so easily and has screen protectors on both sides. Excellent design!
5,It looks like it’s durable it was really easy to install come with screen protector already installed
5,Excellent product.  I’ve dropped my phone on a tile floor and my watch and the cover stayed in tact
5,These cases are great they really protect the watch and plus i Iove that it gives a sporty look to it! They are great I would recommend to get
3,Screen broke within a month
5,It came with a nice spot free cleaning pad. Protection is very good I definitely recommend it for your watch and buy their products.. thanks
5,Gives the watch a little personality A little pizazz. Haven’t used them yet.
5,Great protection for my Apple Watch stronger that previous ones I purchased
2,This watch case is EXTREMELY durable and attractive. My BIG problem—the touch screen is virtually unusable!  I have to press extremely hard for it to read my touch at all and the edges of the screen won’t read at all. Very disappointing. This issue brought my rating from a 5 to a 2!!!!
5,Got this for my husband. It matched well with his metal band he already had and made it look like a real watch. Very sleek
5,so far it hasn't cracked or scratched  takes bumps well agents hard surfaces .
5,It’s a great protector for the watch
5,I truly recommend this one product since it is well constructed and durable.
5,Sturdy with extra protection especially for doing yard work or anything outdoor as well as indoor to protect your watch!! Love that 2 comes in a pack!!
5,
5,Love itttt. It’s a little bit hard to put on but that’s ok
5,Like it for looks and protection.One complaint is that the knob is partially covered.
5,Amazing product feels great and have two colors options. It feels super fit. And is shock proof.
3,Tapping corners suck. Moisture gets in easy. Context: sweat gets in after a workout. Look elsewhere.
2,I don’t recommend this cover if you unconsciously hit you wrist a lot. I’ve already lost mine in under 2 hours. I didn’t even notice when I lost it.
5,Nice
5,I’d buy them again. Good protection against bumps easy to install and clean.
5,Looks great and is so easy to install. Just pop it on and its ready to go. Love this watch case
5,Love ho easy it is to get on and the protection it gives my watch.
1,Glue on back of case only lasted a week and now theres a bubbly blurry screen and i cant read my watch. I wore it a total of 4 times before this happened
5,This product was a great investment and Father’s Day gift. My boyfriend loves it and feels that it is durable.
5,
5,Great product fits great touchscreen vary responsive
5,Great product to help keep your Apple Watch safe. Responsive screen protector  looks great too.
5,I’d say it was well worth the price
5,Received in tact and exactly as described. Quality is high and colors are great!
5,Very good product of good quality !!!  I recommend it
5,Buen material
2,Just minutes into a walk this happens. Not for active people. Touch screen not so responsive
5,Fits perfect! Sturdy and product looks great.
5,This product is very easy to install and it is awesome.
5,Watch cases are exactly as described. Fit my SE 44mm perfectly. Screen is very responsive and they look great!
5,Bought this for my new Apple Watch. Fits great looks great excellent protection.
5,Easy to install and looks pretty good on the watch. Durable and easy on the touch
5,Love it! I can actually use my touch screen feature with this case. Installs very easily! Thanks!
5,Easy to put on and give the watch great protection.
5,Nice quality…..fits as if it were an actual apple product.
5,Love it. Great look and very comfortable to wear. Awesome case!!! Would definitely recommend and buy again.
5,Loved this case !! Extremely protective and sleek looking ! Truly love it so much
1,was totally excited to get these so i could get protection for my Apple Watch 7 after opening the box i was dissapointed to see the black one already had cracked no damage to packing material or box had a hairline crack going through the tempered glass now i guess im stuck using just the white one dont have the time to send this back for refund
5,Was just as advertised easy to put on and fits well
2,I won’t spend my money on this product not worth the price
2,This case makes my touchscreen not work as well like I can’t touch the side of my Apple Watch it won’t work I have to take it off for it to work.
5,Easy to install great touch screen and durable.
2,Decent product and easy to install but the touch screen is hardly responsive unless you are legitimately mashing down on it.
5,Not only is it durable but it looks great!
1,The case was very easy to install. I cannot rate anything else because it fell off while my son was running and he couldn't find it. He put the other one on that came in the two pack and it also fell off while he was wearing it. We did find that one though.
1,The product looked great upon arriving easy install and felt Pretty tough but after one hand washing I noticed a lot of water intrusion and after one day the picture provided tells the story
5,Great tought looking
5,Easy to install and looks great. Great protection
1,I bought this 2 pack unfortunately the second I never check till now when I need it and it was all scratched and gouged on the inside corners either never had a inside protector or something but the first one lasted a while but make sure they’re both useable smh
5,
5,
5,Seems to be a good solution to protect my investment.
1,Cannot use the watch with this cover! what’s there point??
5,Great deal
5,They are good quality 🙂 happy with the product.
1,Can’t turn the circle button on the side do not buy!!
5,Watch face cases fit good and look great.
5,Not too bulky even for my 40mm. I’d purchase again.
2,No very responsive to touch. Condensation between screen and watch from sweat. Have to constantly remove to dry.
5,Amazing product…
5,Great buy easy to install and protection. Worth the buy!!!!
5,Those are really good for heavy workers
1,I just received my order and noticed there are brown stains on the white case. I used alcohol wipes and this is the result so far. I need to wipe it a few more times to get it really cleaned up but this is just plain nasty and disgusting. I don't thinj I'll be using this white one just because of these nasty brown stains. This product is a huge disappointment.......
3,Yes I like it
2,I love the products but it came apart after a few months.  I only work it for a couple of weeks. Not very durable.
1,Glass protector scratches so easily and cracks easy when I change the case
5,I love this cases works perfect!
5,Looks good fits well and the protection seems great!
1,Trap dirt under the screen buttons don’t work don’t waste your money
1,I got these for my apple 7 nike edition I’ve tried it with my Nike sports band and my wide Velcro bank and with both the case cuts into the band. Good luck
5,It fit right size
5,Easy to put on and takeoff
1,Used it for 2 days and watch screen shattered
5,Great product very useful
5,Works as advertised
1,Case fell apart within months
2,Crown 👑 won’t turn very good with it on .Great for protection.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Excelente lo recomiendo
5,Just as I ordered
5,Great product
5,Great product fits well
5,Seems sturdy
2,Apenas lo he tenido menos de una semana y hoy se mojo con agua de lluvia inmediatamente se filtró y el plástico protector de adentro comenzó a levantarse. Es muy buena la carcasa para proteger de golpes pero no salpicaduras de agua.
1,Not waterproof… so any water steam humidity or sweat gets under the case and does not allow the touch screen to work. Defeats the purpose of having a protective covering if I have to take it off every ten minutes
1,Pics show after a few hours after I took a shower. Description says that no bubbles form. Well it obviously as water comes in easily between the protector and the watch
5,Fits great
1,The worst quality ever.
2,I use this cover but it really is not perfect. I had a nicer one before this but it broke. The plastic just feels cheap as it gets.  I’m looking for another one already
5,They fit perfectly
1,Did not meet the expectations
1,The screen doesn’t work properly. I tried both of them. Especially on the edges. I cleaned the case and watch.
2,I have had this cover fall off multiple times luckily I find them by retracing my steps. Glass falls out as well
2,It looks nice but in the whole 2 days of using it its fallen off twice once from a dog juming on me and other was simply bumping it on the corner of a wall. Needs a more secure way of keeping it on the watch.
1,Sending back for refund does not work well with touch screen on my 44mm series 6 Apple Watch especially on the edges.
1,Opened the box and it was already broken before installing it. Good luck!
1,Ordered right size and it’s still too big to fit on watch face? Boyfriend even checked his watch to make sure of right size and order from his account same cover same issue. Very unhappy
1,El táctil es una basura prácticamente hay que golpear el reloj para que funcione. NO BOTES EL DINERO
2,The case makes the watch bulky and the touch screen towards the edges becomes hit or miss.  Also the reviews talking about moisture buildup are 100%.
1,Broke super easy!
1,Be aware product description is wrong
1,I like how it should protect the watch but if yo9u hit it against something it falls off
2,Not very responsive. Screen protector not real clear. Also screen protector cracked with minimal impact.
1,Was hoping for a rugged case with a screen protector that would be good anywhere. at my work we aren’t allowed phones on the production floor. while dust is nothing to the case the second you wash your hands it’s over. the only way to clean it out is to take off the case and dry it off. even then there seems to be some sort of bubble that stays in there.
1,Fit perfectly however they scratched easily
1,This product did a terrible job of protecting my Apple Watch. I had the case on for two days and out of no where my screen (not the protection case) had a huge crack In it. It doesn’t protect it at all
1,Disliked
1,Defective product!! Lens popped out on both of them. Don’t buy!!
1,This case looks great and seems like it would do well in protecting from damage but there is one huge problem I have with it.  Anytime I am working out or just get hot in general the space between the screen and protector starts fogging up with moisture.  This product simply won't work for me.  I will have to find a case without built in screen protector.
1,Very cheaply made. Sweat and water gets in between the watch screen and the cover very easily. Both screens broke.
1,This product is easy to install just snaps on. Initially it is crystal clear and very touch sensitive. Over a short period of time it becomes hazy. If I wear my watch outdoors and perspire condensation form between the product and the watch screen making it ugly and reducing touch sensitivity to almost zero.
1,They’re good protection but the screen has what looks like a water bubble but when you take it off it’s not wet. Not sure if the screen is touching the watch too much or what but it makes it harder to look at the screen during the day
2,The cover somehow popped off the first day of use and was lost.
1,This looks great and snaps on nicely however when working out or just washing hands moisture gets trapped between the screen and the screen protector rendering the screen useless.  I would not spend my money on this and get one without a built in screen protector.
1,Easy to install and use followed preinstallation cleaning instructions but once on the watch the responsiveness of the touchscreen went down the drain. Finicky to touch apps in centered screen and doesn’t even register touching on margins. Don’t waste your money.
1,Took it off to clean and it shattered. You ask why i take it off because water and moisture gets in it it u work outside. Garbage will never buy again. Bought two pack and both are shattered in 2 weeks
1,Nothing on the bottom or corners registers touches
1,Bought the 2 pack for protecting my series 6 44mm Apple Watch and for the black/white color. The VERY first time I wore them it cracks. Durability is awful and I would suggest buying a different case for your Apple Watch.
1,I just got this in the mail and tried it on my watch now I’m returning it. The screen protector does not register touches in all locations especially the bottom portion of the screen. I’m really disappointed in this product.
1,I received my order today and was anxious to see how it would look on my watch needless to say they did not fit my Apple Watch series 6. Liars!!
1,I liked the fact it was nice quality but fails in the tempered glass. But I’d avoid this company again. I was told in several e-mails I wouldn’t receive my refund until it was sent back.
1,I never received my item that I purchased it’s such a shame bc it looks like a good product but I guess I just wasted my money…
1,It seems very durable but unfortunately moisture builds up during my workouts rendering the touchscreen unusable. Also the customer service for the seller is non existent. Will be returning
1,It cracked in less than 3 weeks and broke my husbands new Apple Watch 6 in the same straight crack down the watch front. Totally NOT shockproof.
1,The screen cover started peeling off just days after the return window closed.
1,Doesn’t fit probably. Still gets water under it. And you can’t use your watch touch screen with it on. Fogs up easily
1,Both screens cracked in a week. Very disappointed
1,Did not like it
1,the screen cracks as soon as you put it on your watch.
1,Wash your  hands and the screen becomes unusable because any amount of water will get under the protector
1,Moisture builds up underneath the protective screen. Once this happens the touch screen does work!
5,Does the job and protects my watch well
1,Not different then any other cheap cases. Don’t waste money
1,Too hard to get off and on.
1,It keeps filling up with water so I stop taking shower with it
1,DOES NOT FIT THE 6!🤬
1,Touch screen is terrible.
1,Easy to install and it’s durable but water gets between screens
1,Does not fit correctly for a 44mm Apple Watch. Do not purchase.
1,Says it’s compatible but didn’t fit
1,This came with 2. Doesnt fit.
1,Gets water inside
2,I wanted to like this product because it does look really nice.However when you try to touch the corners of the watch it's completely unusable/unresponsive. So I tried to take off the cover to click back on the screen I was trying to get to and the screen protector cracked taking it off.So I got a total of 2 minutes with this protector on before deciding to send back.
4,Easy to i stall but you have to push down really hard for the screen to touch apple watch screen but other than that its a great product
5,Don’t like how it raises up and forms a bubble between the screen protector and screen
5,This is my favorite watch/screen protector I have used so far. I wear my watch everyday in the construction field and this case protects it from everything.
5,I got this cases for my son and he is very pleased with it! He loves the fact that it matches his watch band (which is bought from the same company).
5,I really like it same as described
1,My boyfriend purchased this for me as a gift on 11/28/2021 it was so stupid.Touch Screen cannot be accessed with this case which is clearly dumb because why will I not be able to access the watch with the case on it. Please don’t buy it’s a waste of money. It’s just much of a hassle to have my boyfriend write the review cuz he literally shipped this case to my house. Please don’t buy until this is fixed. Waste of dollars not sustainable.
2,Works fine.  So functionality is great.  But this thing looks like it was designed for jr high school boys who draw comics of armor.
2,It seems to be a good protector but the screen isn't too clearUpdate: after a couple days water and derby get under the screen and so do air bubbles
1,Looked good for about 2 months. Then turned brown… I have OCD and clean EVERYTHING this screen protector has the lightest use and got gross looking ASAP. It did protect the screen though.
1,Got 2 and both are already cracked after a month
5,The case is very durable light and the screen is responsive. It takes 30 seconds to install. One of the buttons is covered (the one below the round one). At the beginning it is very tight when you press it but it will eventually loosen up over time.
5,works perfectly its bulky but that is why i got it. i’ve had one similar before and it was very durable. touch screen can be bit less effective if your hands are wet but it did that even without the case. comes in a two pack in case you wanna swap out the colors.
1,Like others have stated water gets trapped under the unit on the watch face and makes controlling apps impossible. Waste of time and money.
5,Outstanding for the price! Avoid the white ones though they get dirty FAST. Bought some more black ones for backups for the future. These are actually worth buying; highly recommend to a friend!Sadly I burned through my first black one in an accident. BUT this case did an excellent job protecting the watch from 20mph road rash so that was awesome. I faired less well lol.
4,This is a great buy to get 2 of them for this price.  It was very easy to install and comes with the cleaning pads to clean the face of the watch first.  It has the clear plastic tab on the inside and outside of the face which gave me confidence in the product.  It added more bulk to the watch than I thought it would but overall I'm very pleased with it.
5,Love this Particular one works really good for construction purposes.
5,Great deal. Got the black and white versions. The install literally took a minute. Package came with some wipes to clear your screen off and you’re able to snap the new one one quickly. Touch was responsive and screen is clear. Only downside is the side button (not the crown) is a slightly harder to press but not a deal breaker.
5,Good
5,I use these for rock climbing. I’ve used a few different types of snap on screen protectors and I really life this one. For me this is used ONLY during a rock climbing session. So I throw it in my gym bag and pop it on a few times a week. For that it’s great. It’s very protected around the lip and covers the screen with a glass cover. It’s easy to use the screen through the screen protector but obviously not as great as the naked screen would be. For me it’s fantastic for workouts because I only use it for that and don’t touch my watch much during the workout. Get it.
4,These are not bad. The provide great protection including the screen. However they don’t do well with water. I washed my hands and water got underneath the built in screen protector. That would normally be a huge issue except that the screen protector sticks to the screen and isn’t designed to be removed often. It also reduces touch effectiveness at the corners. I will buy again I just won’t use near water.
3,Ok But not perfect somehow stuff still gets inside under the screen little particles of dirt the stickiness for the screen wears out after a little while
5,I got this because my last one kept breaking. We’ll see how it dose with my work. First thoughts are great any time I bent my wrist up Siri would ask what I want. With this cover it doesn’t!
5,Very good product with reasonable price
5,Snap on easy for great protection
5,it looks great and works.  use another brand before and had to change the cover every 3/4 months after bumping into something.
5,Works perfect the touch screen. Very good product affordable. Protects very well the watch
5,My only problem was when I got in the pool with the case on. Water got between the two and made it hard to use the screen without taking it off and drying everything
5,Extremely recommended my watch is in perfect shape still definitely ordering more for the future
5,simply the best
5,Very nice and well made.
5,Very very sturdy! I workout every day of the week and a lot of the times my sweat seeps into the case especially when I wash my hands as well! The design is very nice though!!
5,
5,It’s thicker than the one I used before seems more durable. I hope it holds up! So far so good.The other brand I had my watch shattered inside.
5,
5,I love the look and feel. Was easy to install. Rain still gets between the glass but other than that it’s awesome. I am a steel worker so it protects perfectly.
5,Very durable!
5,Love how easy it was to put on my watch. Looks great and I feel confident in the protection it provides my watch.
5,Quality product easily installed.
5,These came in so handy. Will protect your watch screen from get scratches.
5,Bought these for work but overall work great for not damaging your screen also very durable !
5,Touch sensitivity is great. Works as if there is no case.
5,Amazing product! Works so well and I know my watch is protected when I am wearing this case! I fell the other day took of the case and not a mark on my watch!
5,These are sturdy cases and incredibly easy to install. Definitely recommend worth the money!
5,Very easy to install and like the rugged look.
5,These work great. We bought others like this and with in a week they would be broke. But not this one. He's had it on his watch for a few weeks and it still looks new
5,Absolutely love these Apple Watch screen protectors! Very rugged yet sleek enough to not add too much extra bulk!
1,Screen cracked in blue cover when cleaning it from water. Cover on watch look good but if it gets wet water gets between cover and watch. Needing it to be cleaned.
5,Great product for the price!
3,I’m not sure there’s a product like this out there that doesn’t fog up during exercise. I find myself having to take the protector off a couple times after workouts to wipe it down so the touchscreen will work. It’s a trade off with keeping your watch protected.
5,My husband is very hard on things and these have lasted him so long. Still easy to use touch screen and very easy installation! All in all great product!
5,I like its durability. It is perfectly fit to my apple watch.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               semira clarito
5,Love them. Cool looking. Easy to snap on or pop off.No worries about bumping my watch and scratching it now.
5,Protects great
5,Easy to install. Has already saved my watch from some serious damage.
5,It’s very good quality. Fits well and easy to put on without having to remove the band to install.
5,I like it over all.  Only thing that is kind an issue is any time it gets wet you have to take it off and dry the protector and screen and put back on.
4,Very durable and keeps liquid out better than most
3,The screen it to hard or doesn’t fit flush to the screen of the watch and when you try Typing i does not detect the touch annoying!
5,Very rugged case but not too bulky. The aesthetic is subtle but you can feel the weight and protection it offers that differs from lighter cases. The touchscreen works perfect and it doesn’t easily come off.
5,Stylish great 360 protection and overall a great design. Love it
5,Nice to have two choose from and the extra backup case. Easy to install not covering the strap attachments like some do. Seem very rugged and durable. The protective cover is nice clear plastic easy to clean and see through
5,Easy to follow instructions were included the case actually goes on easily.  The screen protector comes with cleaning wipes and no problems at all with the touch fingerprints wipe off easily.  The case itself has a rugged look to it has a lip all around the case which further protects the iWatch.  I would purchase this case again.
5,I want to protect my new apple watch and these covers are durable easy to install and look great on!
5,The cover snaps easily onto watch without scratching the surface of the watch. The built in tempered glass is extremely durable. The touch screen sensitivity is not compromised at all. Word of advice not to wash hands or dishes while wearing it since it will cause water to get trapped in the back of the cover. But since you can easily take it off and clean it..this will not be an issue. The outside of the cover is hard plastic not soft tpu like the others..overall a great durable protective cover.
5,Got these today. Was worried they would be too bulky but they are the perfect size. The fully protect my watch and look amazing. So easy to snap on an off!
5,It was very easy to install and it’s durable I’m so happy 😄
5,I usually use this style of apple watch protector since it keeps the screen and body free of scratches. So far this one is holding up with no issues.
5,As a millwright I needed something stronger and more protective then most. So far this case has held up very well against welding and cutting slag and sparks as well as a wide range of chemicals. I do wish it was waterproof but what do you expect with a snap on case. The touch screen is noticeably less responsive in my opinion that is a easy trade off for being well protected
5,Berry nice
5,This case fit perfectly on my Apple Watch. It looks great and feels nice. It doesn’t feel to bulky. It also protects the sides and the screen. So You are getting two In one. And the best part is a two pack.
5,Good product
5,These are actually good cases.  I have the blue which matches my series 6 watch perfectly.  I feel at ease with the case on.  It does not effect the touch screen
5,This is my second set of covers  the first set saved my watch ( the covers have a tempered glass in them just like the glass phone screen protector) will keep buying as long as they make them
5,Looks nice!
5,Just what I was needing and cheaper than the local stores
5,Love the look and very durable
5,I had low expectations when I first took them out of the case. The case felt like cheap plastic and I wasn’t sure how it would protect my investment. But after a couple days of using it and dropping my watch I am very impressed.The Case is much bulkier than previous cases I have used but it is worth the extra space. Weight wise I don’t notice a difference from my previous cases for the watch. The extra size is on the sides and top does not come down the below the watch it’s self.The couple times that I have dropped the watch bounces. It has even fallen face first which I thought for sure would have cracked the glass but it did not!It was a pain to get on the watch and it was a very tight fit but once it was on it has stayed nice and secure.I love that it came with a pair and the 2nd one is stored away ready in the event anything happens to the first one. I will definitely be ordering a 2nd pair and would recommend this case to anyone!!
5,This covers my watch a bit more than ones I’ve used in the past. Very happy with these.
5,I was hesitant to buy with the built in screen protection but I was impressed by how well it works. Makes watch a little bigger looking and seems rugged!!
5,Like it
5,Very good product
5,Easy to install
5,Good
5,I work in the construction field. This thing works great and with all the close calls I’ve had. It’s still in one peace.
5,Well fit
5,Easy to install and looks great
4,Nice price
5,These cases are much better than the previous cases I purchased from another vendor. I’ll definitely purchase from this vendor again.
5,very fashionable nice pc case quality with real tempered glass love it! Comes with 2 colors. Wish they had more options for colors like Rainbow or Unity colors ty!
5,Looks great very easy to install and stay’s on well.I thought it was going to pop off easily but it’s nice and secure.Several different colors to choose from.
5,Works great and easy to install
5,This case for your watch is a great buy. The build quality and the simplicity makes me happy. The screen is very good when using your watch. Definitely recommend
5,Easy to install looks like a watch should!
5,I like these because you don’t have to take off the watch to put it on. Touch screen works the same as if nothing was on it. Easily snaps on and off. Haven’t had any issues with moisture but if I did it’s easy to take off. A little bulky but makes the watch look nice
5,The watch covers are great for going out and doing activities outdoors. If you are like me and go camping almost every weekend. These will be great for that because of the tempered glass it lets me know that if something happens my screen will be covered.
5,Got Apple Watch series 7 45mmFirst day I put it got a lot of scratches. This case was definitely needed.
5,Strong cover. Would recommend
5,Excelente
5,This product is a perfect gift for the guy in your life! I got these and gifted them to my boyfriend because he’s super hard on his watch face. He has had other bumpers before and they have like popped off in random places. These have been put through the ringer and haven’t popped off and have protected his watch. 10/10 recommend!
5,I love the case it is super secure and durable I would totally recommend it
5,Super durable and easy to put on a bit difficult to take off but overall definitely worth it!
5,Love them both. Fits great and looks nice too
5,Such nice cases for the watch
5,This watch cover is very sturdy very nice definitely would buy again.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Absolutely love this case very durable. I have total faith that with my clumsy fingers if I drop it three cases will protect the face of my watch.
5,encaja de manera perfecta y es muy resistente.producto 100% recomendado
3,No tan resistentes como dice la descripción pero muy simple de montar prácticos y útil.
5,Great quality and perfect y
3,The screen protector is not glass it is plastic and it is not highly responsive like the description says. if you are trying to tap something at the edge of the screen you have to put a lot of pressure in order for it to register on the watch.
4,It makes my $500 Apple watch look like something I bought from Toys-R-Us.  However it IS durable and it does work exactly as described; easy to install doesn't fall off.  It's just too bulky for me and the corners catch on my jacket sleeves.I will find something more rounded and stylish and save these for Summer hikes etc.
5,Great product! Still using the first one and most never last a week with me. But this is up to 2 months now.
5,Product looks great and was easy to apply. The only thing that could be better is durability. They scratch pretty easy.
5,My husband likes it he said it looks good
5,Fast easy affordable great Product
5,My job is physical and this holds up very good. Easy to install and I would definitely buy again
5,He's like a bull in a China shop. This holds up very well for the price. More than I was expecting. Easy install as well. It takes some adjustments if you're used to barely touching the screen as built in ones require a little harder tapping for feedback.
5,Definitely love how easy this protector was to install! It was in all in one case and screen protector. Chose it because it matches my case and is protecting all the way around with the exception of the bottom. Recommended!!!
5,good price looks good does the job
5,This case is much better than the competition.  The raised edges and the button to control the push button on side is a game charger.
5,Fits perfectly on my watch recommend it !!
5,Very well designed product fits like a glove. Stylish and wonderfully priced..highly recommend!!
5,Easy to install does its job. Only issue I had was getting water between the screen and the glass but that was easily solved by popping it off drying it and popping it back on. No complaints.
5,Fits perfect
5,Excelente producto lo recomiendo
5,Really like the color. Looks nice on my watch
5,I like how the case has that sporty rugged look to it. It also has a built in screen cover which gives me a peace of mind when I accidentally swing my arm. It fully covers the sides but not the back which is expected. The screen does not affect the sensitivity of the face of the watch.
5,I love how durable it is and the fact that it doesn’t fall off easily. Matches great with my sports bands too.
5,I love this its simple durable and the touch screen is awesome . Best part all functions work and keeps the i watch protected .
5,I got this for my 44mm Apple Watch. This is a lightweight and decent case for the price. This doesn't feel bulky or uncomfortable when wearing. Highly recommend getting a case for the Apple Watch to keep it safe and this is a great choice.
5,works great for protecting the face does the job
5,I like it
5,Super nice quality!! It’s not too thick or bulky there’s just enough to make it look just right. I work at a warehouse and this is great protection and doesn’t look ridiculous or feel heavy. Very nice.
5,Great watch cover for my Apple watch
5,Brought these after reading a few reviews a few said that the screen sensitivity is impacted - I found no issues with this works perfectly. Great fit and really easy to install and case very durable.I have used a few separate screen protectors with the cases in the past and always found that if it gets knocked the screen protector lifts and bubbles. This item is the answer to this issue - Watch is protected as well as the screen.
4,Is good and resistant but sometimes gets steamed inside around the Edges I  have to remove to clean.
4,傷は防ぐことはできる製品そのものは耐水性あると思いますただ、カバーの隙間から水が進入することがあるのでカバーをはずして水分は拭かないとディスプレイは見づらくなりますまあ問題ではありませんね
5,Really good product
3,思ったより大きく、以前のカバーよりは頑丈な気がします。装着は簡単ですが逆に物に当たってしまったときに、知らないうちに脱落していて無くしかけたことも。
5,Fits perfect stronger than others I’ve used before and the screen protector is better than others as I don’t need to press hard
4,Fitting and removing is a breeze overall look is a little bulky but it is rugged and protects the Apple Watch screen.
4,Provides good protection to the watch face and touch screen works finea little bit ugly but does its job
3,９時に注文で夕方６時に着いた。早いね。物は…それなりかな。悪くも無いけど凄くチープです。
3,Tough case but when working out this lets in moisture between the case and watch. This impacts the ability to use the touch screen effectively. Might be better products out there if you use your watch for working out.
2,耐久性や取り付けやすさは問題ないでしょうが、肝心な操作性についてはかなり難ありです。Digital Crownは回しにくいし、タッチの反応も悪い。角度によっては見にくくなります。まだ1個しか試していませんがもう一個の方に変えても同じだったら無駄な買い物をしたなと…
3,Keeps the screen safe but not from dust ect I’m finding I have to take the protector off at least once a day to wipe away a build up of dust
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I cracked my screen whilst working with power tools so once i had replaced the screen  i was keen to stop that happening again this will certainly do that it is very rugged so no chance of a repeat issue in regards to impact damage.  That said if you want to use the watch as normal the cover does lower the sensitivity of the screen. Direct taps work but side swiping left or right is hit and miss and quite frustrating.  As something to put on when you are working it is fine very easy to click into place/remove  but as a day to day cover it is not great.
3,To bulky and seem a bit flimsy
5,ホームボタン以外を全面保護しており安心。また、画面の操作性も申し分無いです。2枚あるので、神経質な私も気にせず普段使い出来ます。
1,Do not let yourself fooled by the big number of many stars reviews. Purchased the protective case for hiking used for a day hike and not impressed at all not only products like this end up in the bin very fast therefore very unsustainable.1) the watch looks absolutely dreadful with this thing on no aesthetics just dreadful2) unless you choke your wrist with the watch bracelet the watch goes continuously in Lock Screen as it restrains the back of the watch touching your skin/arm3) followed the instructions whipped the watch screen (even though I ordered the protective case before I purchased the watch therefore watch was brand new) dried it out but the case sweats in between the watch’s screen and case protective screen therefore the watch touch screen becomes unresponsive therefore useless (see the photos)4) the protective case is made of very hard plastic fits well tight and if any dust particles end up in between the case/watch will definitely scratch/damage the watch aluminium body (maybe stainless steel case is more scratch resistant I don’t know). Even without dust/sand particles I have my concerns that over repeated install dismantling will end up scratching/damaging the watch body.5)6)7)8)9) ♾ I can’t express myself how dreadful the watch looks on top on loosing its abilities and performance just extremely ugly.Obviously returned unfortunately if many won’t return because it is not great value this rubbish will end up where it belongs in the waste bin therefore adding to the plastic wastage. Sellers should clamp down into doggy plastic products and refuse stocks and selling. Unless we start being a bit smart and fair on the plastic consumption we will end up with all sorts of unsustainable plastic waste all over the place.My honest opinion rather give the money to a charity of you have spare money rather than buying this rubbish
5,Liked it that much ordered another set as they are the best cases I’ve used
5,取り付けやすい
5,Easy to fit it’s had a few bumps all ready and it’s done it’s job.
5,Fits well touch screen perfect response took a few wacks against metal and no scratches
3,このカバーをつけると、コンプリケーションのタップが効かない。頑丈そうだし耐久性もありそうなのに、これじゃ使い物にならないよ
5,I have tried a few options to keep my Apple Watch safe without loosing usability due to a new puppy in the house! I was concerned this type of protector would maybe have an impact on the touchscreen etc but nope works like a charm! No issues with the touchscreen fits super snug and protects the watch perfectly! It’s also nice to be able to switch straps and keep the cover very recommended
5,After me previously destroying 2 apple watches wifey thought it was a great idea to buy us 1 each. I had the better idea of looking for something like this and ordered the twin pack. Months later the watches are still looking like new despite me wearing it fixing the car messing about in the workshop and general life. Wifeys a bit gentler on hers and her only complaint is it is a bit chunky
2,Works okay for protection however if you want to use the touch screen I wouldn’t bother as it interferes with any of your attempts.
5,デザインもイメージ通りで良き。タッチの反応も良き。耐久性はまだ分からず。
5,Touch sensitivity works great right to the corners of the screen. Previous covers I’ve had were more sculptured to the watch so looked invisible but edge screen touch was hit and miss and they cracked/broke too easily they save the screen from damage but I was getting through them like a bad case of the squirts. These covers being more robust I’m still on the first one months later…….
5,I've not had much success with these in the past but these seem excellent so far. I can't comment on the durability as not had them long but they seem sturdy enough. I'll revise this later down the line if needed. The responsiveness on the touch screen is fantastic though and took seconds to put on.
3,Apple Watch7の45mmを使っています！（女性です）G-SHOCKみたいにしたくてゴツゴツとしたカバーを探してまして購入しました。結構お気に入りです。私服でもスーツのときでも気にはならないかなぁと思っています！大きさは、慣れるのとG-SHOCK好きな人は大きさは気にならないかとおもいます！デメリットは走ったりトレーニングしたら中に汗が入り込むので三つにしました。普段、7〜10キロ毎日走ってるためApple Watchつけて走ると終わる頃には中に浸水します。残念…。あとは、パーフェクトだと思います。G-SHOCK好きな人だったら気にはならないかと思います！汗が中に浸水しなければ5です。
5,Water gets inside the case easy but other then that it was a good buy
5,On first glance this seems superb for the price! The screen feels like actual tempered glass rather than these other generic ones available that are all the same but have different brand names. Fits perfectly and the chunkiness adds a bit of meat to the watch which I prefer. The button needed for apple pay needs a really firm push to operate which is a downside but the wheel button functions as normal. Really happy with this purchase let's see if it holds up! Also no rainbow effect or humidity under the screen like these other bumper screen protectors!
3,Fitted the watches fine  and the touch screen still worked ok but the screens did not last long before they popped off /became unstuck so disappointed with the on that score  I did get a refund for them as they didn’t have the same colour pack to replace so was happy with that
5,Easy to fit makes the watch chunkier and has added great protection
5,Goood
5,仕事で天井裏に登って配線をしたりするのですが、傷がつかない。デザインもオシャレで脱着もスムーズ
3,似たようなモノと比べ少しだけ大きいです。また画面左下のあたりの接触が悪く、ガラスのドット柄が見えてしまっているのが残念。
5,Easy to fit and easy to use and there’s 2 in the pack great quality product and quality price thanks
4,Got good durability easy to fit but not good for swimming with as water gets under the screen and pushes buttons on the screen. But still great otherwise for protection
4,Very easy to install it and protects the watch
5,NIKEスポーツバンドブラックに装着。グレー、ブラックどちらも色味がバッチリ合ってとても満足です。作りも堅牢なのでジムでのワークアウト時やMTB乗車時にもぶつけても安心して使えております。
5,Needed a solid case to protect my apple watch so decided to go for this one as it looked like it could take a good beating. Also saw that it would protect the screen which is very important for me.The case fits very nicely over the watch and I can still access the crown and the button. The screen is still responsive as it was so happy with that.Comes with wipes to clean the watch screen priro to fitting.Although it makes the watch feel bigger I would rather that then have a damaged watch.Cheap enough so that if the case gets damaged then I will just swap out as you get two in the pack. I went for the navy blue and black. Only tried the Navy blue as it matches my strap.So far so good.
5,This came with wet and dry cleaning tissues and two cases black and blue. I fitted the black cover really easy to fit and (in my opinion) looks great. Does not look cheap (as mentioned in other reviews) and the screen is still very responsive with the protective cover. I am very happy with this purchase.
5,Brilliant case. No issues with it what so ever. Looks really smart and fits super snug.To have a tactical case with an inbuilt screen protector is brilliant lots of people forget about an actual screen protector for their Apple Watch.To also have a two pack is brilliant too.Worth a buy for sure.
5,Ideal
5,I ordered these because my screen on my iWatch series 3 was starting to come away from the watch. Easy to put on and is now holding the screen in place till I can get it fix. The only problem I found is with big fingers it’s a little tricky to turn the dial but that is the only problem I’ve found with it!Would I recommend it to other? Yes I would.
4,This case is easy to attach the touchscreen works perfectly (I have tried others where the touch screen does not work once the protector has been applied).The item was delivered earlier than expected.Overall great product and the service was just as good.
4,A nice tough case that’s easy to install and protects a large part of the watch including the screen. Time will tell if this deserves 5 stars unsure how it will fare with water submission under the screen.
2,取り付けはちゃんと付属のウエットペーパーとペーパーで拭き装着、使用してましたが、使用当日にすでに空気が入りました。残念です
5,Very easy to fit without having to take the straps off to put it on  having prevented scratching my old series 3 screen ( didn’t effect the usage) when I upgraded to the SE my first buy was the screen protector to go with it .
5,This product is amazing but need work on the touching it
5,Very good case that protects my watch I would recommend to friends and family so thanks again
5,Easy to fit
2,タッチの感度が悪い、端のほうが押せなくてイライラする
5,This case looks great and provides complete protection for the watch.Looks rugged but is not too thick that it makes the watch significantly bigger. It does not impair the touch screen at all and the wrap around design fills me with confidence that it will protect me watch from bangs and scratches.For me this is highly recommended as you also get a spare but to be honest I am not sure if I will need the second one as after a month the case still looks like new. All in all really happy with this purchase.
3,This cover is a good looking one seems durable but early days yet. Just so disappointed that it’s not waterproof when showering you have to keep removing the cover to clean how difficult can it be to put a rubber seal on the inside of the glass most on the market today are the same.
5,Good value good product
5,Best screen protectors on the market. Others I’ve had in the past have getting moisture under it which becomes annoying but not with this one a must buy
4,Much better than other brands. Have lasted  a lot longer than any other case. Quite bulky.
5,I ordered this product as I cracked my previous watch case at the gym this so far has taken quite a beating and is still holding up very well! It is a lot stronger than a silicon or clear plastic case so i recommend if you intend to use the watch in harsher environments. I crushed my last case within a week at the gym with weights and i’ve had these for longer and no crushing just yet which is great! The screen also continues to work well through the screen protector.
1,Initially thought this might be ok but the side of the case split after 3 days just a small break slowly getting wider to the point where 5 days later it wont even stay on the watch. Rather disappointing
4,The media could not be loaded.
5,I have been through many Apple Watch cases and pretty much either lost them from falling off or they have gone a funny colour. This one is great. Looks good protects the watch very well and most importantly does not fall off! The touch screen still works fine as well unless you get water underneath it which is expected. Very impressed
3,Partner only wore this for few hours and the screen cracked in a couple of places not happy
5,Just upgraded my series 3 Apple Watch to a series 6 44mm and was looking for a screen protector. This is a brilliant product to protect the screen. The touch screen works perfect and the plastic surround should give good protection. It even comes as a two pack so you have a spare one just in case you need one. I would highly recommend this product if your looking for protection for your Apple Watch.
5,Does exactly what it says and the blue case matched Apples blue strap.Quality fit all round whilst allowing easy actin to the control buttons on the RHS.Compliments the watch perfectly.Just a pity its a two pack as given how well made this is your unlikely to need to replace it anytime soon!  Give your spare to a friend :-)This fits the Apple Watch 6 44mm.
4,Perfect
5,I’ve bought a number of different Applewatch cases - these are easily my favourite.Good qualityresponsive touch screen and sturdy build makes me confident my watch will be well protected.
5,Item fits onto my watch perfectly and protects it well. Matches perfectly with the blue strap that this retailer also sells.Side button cover could stick out a little bit more so the button is easier to press but other than that not a problem!Worth the money especially considering two covers come in the pack!Will be buying from this store again.
5,Good quality and fits well
5,Excellent
1,この品質でこの値段はないなやめた方が良い。
5,This product was to replace a previous product purchased a couple of weeks before. The original somehow managed to shatter when I knocked a door frame. I cannot fault the speedy reply and replacements I was given. Absolutely 100 percent great seller and would use them again. In my job other types scratched within a couple of days these so far have not scratched.
1,Nice fit looks good until….while out walking in the Lake District I got fought in a light rain shower.The water got under this case and the screen steamed up when I removed it to clear it the inside face of the cover easily scratched.I would not buy this if you intent to use you watch in outdoor activities in England !!
5,I love how simple it is to add the protector. And the instructions are made for a 4 year old. It comes with a wet and dry wipe and did not take more than two minutes. Great product great price and now I’m not so nervous about scratching my watch : )
5,On my watch which is worn daily in a garage spilt oil on it smashed it scratched it and it’s holding up well
1,カッコよくなりましたが、画面の反応は死にます。時計を求めるならアリかも。
1,At 1st glance looks to do the job. Bought for sons iWatch as he works in the trades and his watch gets dusty. Was fine for a week but when son went to remove it to clean as well as the watch as it didn’t stop the dust getting in the watch face came off. Apple engineer said the battery was swollen due to being extra hot most likely due to the case that was on it. As iWatch is out of warranty and happened due to case I am not able to get it replaced under their battery scheme (as they don’t replace swollen battery in iWatch) and my son no longer has his iWatch therefore highly not recommended.
5,The case fits the Watch series 6 perfectly. It is well protected from any knocks or scrapes. The tempered glass face cover provides excellent protection and works seamlessly with the watch. The case itself does not add too much bulk to the watch and looks quite smart. Any watch strap fits the case. Highly recommended.
5,very good
5,The case’s neat looks really good and I was expecting to be somehow bulkier but nope  it’s very protective and thin at the same time. Prices are good and def worth the buy. It’s a good case if your into sports hiking swimming im sure it will protect my watch from any mostly unwanted scratches and falls.
5,Works well other than side button difficult to press
1,It was not good as water was going inside the apple watch7  also was getting FOg inside  asked to return they refused waste of money
3,Unfortunately the screen has got hairline scratches which obscures the view.
5,Really easy to snap on with a good snug fit. 2 x cases so great value for money! Many stylish and practical colours. I chose navy and black as shown in pictures and also looks great. The tempered glass screen gives your watch excellent protection.
5,Great protector for a man who works in a manual role. Protection for the screen area and corners. Robust and well made.
5,Worked as advertised - does NOT limit any functionality - very happy
5,Thais product is very durable it was two pack and I gave one to my partner and he is able to wear his watch to work without it getting destroyed! We are both very happy with this product! The screen protector does not effect the touch sensitivity!
1,Very poor quality as it does not seal around your watch. When you wash your hands water gets inside the case which is trapped between the watch face and protector. Forever having to remove it to dry it. Just buy a glass screen protector that you put direct on the face
5,Good Quality case. Hard Material snaps on to the face of the watch within seconds and has a strong grip around the face of the watch with full protection around the face of the watch. 100% recommended!! This is good value for money.
5,
5,These are absolutely brilliant. Wear my apple watch daily to my hands on job and these protect it just perfect!
5,It does what it says on the tin
5,Rugged durable case which also comes with dry/wet wipes to clean your Apple Watch. Not as delicate looking as other cases but you can rest assured that nothing will happen to your watch face!
1,Having used a few different “rugged” apple watch protectors i can honestly say this is the worst. Looks great looks rugged but it isn’t. Out of all the ones ive used in the past the screen has never cracked i end up replacing them due to the plastic housing breaking around the buttons. This one lasted a massive one hour before i noticed one crack corner to corner then an hour or so later another crack. I’ve not knocked my wrist on anything so i can only assume it’s from the flex against my hand/wrist with it being quite bulky. Thought i was onto a winner won’t be buying again. Absolute garbage.
5,Touch screen is normal no sudden enlargement ! your watch don’t get steamed up or any condensation good quality for the money very happy with this product.
5,Fantastic cases. Very rugged and stylish. I have had a few other ones and these are by far the best. I would highly recommend them if you want to protect your expensive Apple Watch from scratches.
5,This protector is highly recommended. Very sturdy and gives your watch a rugged look for a change. Fits my watch very well easy to install and most importantly the touch sensitivity isn't affected at all.
5,This product is worth every penny. The best touch response and protection I’ve experienced. I thought it would be uncomfortable like the others I’ve tried but this is the most comfortable one yet. Highly recommended!
5,Prevented new Apple series 6 from damage during recent adventure holiday.  Didn’t affect usability of the touch screen.  Makes the watch slightly bulkier but you have to compromise if you want the protection it offers.
5,This is my first cover/screen protector for my new iWatch. Clicks on easy and surrounds all sides. All buttons easily accessed and touchscreen facility works fine. Very rugged and sturdy.
2,The screen is not very responsive while the case is on and the side button cover doesn’t fit very well
5,Get one is worth the money 👌
1,Makes the watch look like a big square if you take it off and put it back on then the sensitivity of the screen goes to zero poor quality
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 My new Apple Watch
5,I love the cover looks very stylish  and robust it will protect my Apple Watch so well . I would highly recommend it . Great price to
5,This product really sturdy great for me for work I’m carpenter so takes few knocks. Touch screen very responsive. Over all good value for the money.
1,防水と書いてあったので購入したのですが、仕事で少し使うことがあったので大丈夫だと思い使用したところ水の侵入があり困りました。これだと、仕事には使えないです。
5,Really sturdy case a lot of protections.  No problem with the touch screen reacts perfectly!! Great value!! Amazing products 100% would buy again
5,Very happy with this purchase. Case is easy to apply and remove. Touch screen is still responsive.
5,Easy to attach good sensitivity not expensive 2 in a pack!  What more could you ask for
5,Sturdy and well built not too large but substantial enough to offer protection from everyday knocks. Perfect fit with no loss of sensitivity through the inbuilt screen protector
5,Solid product and amazing value for money. Touch screen still works perfectly with the case on and it’s great protection against scratches and bumps
5,Great case. Very protective. In my job I need the best protection for my devices. This case is ideal and not bulky.
5,A+
5,Strong sturdy feels like it can protect my apple watch well
1,Poorly fitting cover that fouls the wheel in the side of the Watch face. Puts undue pressure on the wheel and it cannot be operated when the cover is on. Sits at an angle preventing the side opposite the wheel from being operated by touch screen.
5,Great product strong and durable also looks good on my Apple Watch
5,Fantastic value for money. Great customer service. Just what case I need fir my line of heavy work.Thanks. 😀
5,Good quality product perfect all round protection on the watch face. The touchscreen functionality is fine too and it doesn’t affect the image quality
1,すぐに隙間から水が入って、画面との間にたまります。画面曇ったりもします。傷がつかないことだけがメリットです。
2,Great value but it can be difficult to use the touch screen
5,They look very very nice. More elegant than I thought. I love I have 2 colours to change with my straps. ❤️
5,Had the case for about 2 weeks it protects the screen well and doesn’t mist up when exercising. Very happy.
5,Love the cover.  Firs easy so no problem to swap them gives great protection and looks great
5,Easy to fit. Looks good. Doesn’t restrict any of the watch’s functions
1,I knocked the leather steering wheel getting into my van and it broke the screen protector but not the watch face. But I thought it would be more had wearing.
5,Solid product easy to put on and remove brilliant protection for your watch
5,Good case protects the watch well.I’ve used it while climbing and does the job well.
5,Goid
5,very sturdy cases and a great price for 2 looks great on.
5,Good in the gym
5,Absolutely brilliant tough comfortable case would highly recommend. Excellent service 👊🏻
5,Brilliant sturdy cases. Looks good and touch screen is responsive.
5,Good quality item fits well and protects my watch from damage
1,2個入りの商品ですが、片方の物は撥油コーティングが一部剥がれており、非常に見にくく使い物になりませんでした。また、液晶保護面は凹曲しており、斜めから見た時に光が反射し見難い上に、四角のタッチ感度が悪いです。
5,Really well built love the side button
5,They work
5,For my I watch very reasonable fantastic price
5,Arrived earlier than expected really good quality
5,Really good value for money.Recommended for sure

5,Sturdy protection and looks smart 👌🏽
5,Amazing sturdy quality ideal for everyday use
5,Excellent quality.
5,Great product very strong and look great !!
5,Love it
1,Crazy tight when fitting. Next to no sensitivity on touch screen. Will not be buying again and will probably bin before it’s even broken.
1,The first cover broke after a few days of purchase. The screen just popped out! And the second cover did the same after only a week of use! It s a shame as I spent more on this product thinking it would last longer but it wasn’t the case at all. Disappointed to be honest. I assumed with the reviews it gotit would last considerably a lot longer than expected.
1,No matter how I try to fit this thing the rotary wheel gets blocked by it. I’ve got a series 7 Apple Watch so maybe it’s a slightly different size or something but sod it! Going in the bin
2,Chunky bigger than expected touch screen doesn’t respond well especially in the corners.
1,カバー力はあるけどタッチ反応しないおすすめしません
1,Touch does work : then the screen cracked day 3 : terrible :
1,Not very good mine arrived and the film within the case left a sticky mark on the screen waste of money.
1,doesnt fit properly
1,Lack of adhesive rounds screen protect watch for a few weeks then the screen falls out
1,Kept deleting the numbers when typing
1,The crown watch is not set well it does not move smoothly
1,Done some exercise and sweat got between watch and protective screen.
