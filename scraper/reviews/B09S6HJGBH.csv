4,First neck speaker for me.... the price was right on special. Build quality is good. Sound quality is very good though I have no comparison neck speakers.I use this mostly for listening to baseball games and podcasts. Phone calls as well. It totally serves its purpose: I am hands free but not shut out from all ambient sound... I can still hear things around me which means my life is healthier and safer (I tend to break things when I wash dishes with headphones on...lack of ambient sound makes me more clumsy). The weight is fine. I can listen for extended periods of time. People around me can faintly hear what I'm listening to but barely.That said this device needs somehelp:1) no mute button. That is a major bummer since it means I have to have my phone with me to quickly mute something. If I'm using it and someone in my house wants to talk with me I have to mute my phone. That makes no sense in the modern world of bluetooth when muting from the bluetooth speaker is standard.2) no control to audio source- no pause etc. Again simple to do not sure why it is not on this device.3) When the system starts up or shuts down it speaks very loudly. That defeats the purpose of a neck speaker.4) When it first connects to the audio source things are weird. First the volume starts at a set volume (loud) which defeats the purpose of the device. Second the frantic attempts to lower the volume right away don't work. It takes a few seconds for the controls to work. This is a bug and is annoying.5) Battery life could be better. There is no warning that the device is running low. Again simple things that could probably be fixed with a firmware update. In fact most/all of these problems could be improved with a firmware update.Monster please improve this product!
4,Note: There should be absolutely no “jitter” - I’m not talking about the bass rumble. My first set had almost like a rattle from its left side. The replacement works perfectly.You are probably buying this because Bose discontinued their SoundWear Companion and you are desperately searching for an alternative (or affordable) solution.Let’s get one thing out of the way - the build quality of Monster Boomrang is on par with Bose. The Boomrang is even slightly lighter than Bose which is a good thing.The sound quality of Monster is almost identical to that of Bose (sound quality is subjective) and I said almost identical. Bose sound is very slightly fuller than Boomrang because it is also bulkier (ability to put better speakers with better bass). But please don’t let that deter you. You’ll be every bit as impressed.That said I’m going to tell you a trick that will instantly improve your liking toward this speaker (and Bose if you have that one). The trick is to raise the speaker straight up by one or two inches. It instantly overhauls the bass response. To do that ladies and gents take your neck scarves out! If you wear a double folded scarf just around your neck and wear this speaker on top it you’re going to love it!I am sorry about hot summers but at least at home (you’re mostly using this at home anyway) or in winter you’ll easily be able to improvise.For $99 (sometimes less) this is a steal.
5,I wasn’t sure what to expect but had heard positive reviews from others. I got them mainly to use while I work at my computer.  I like to be able to get up and move and still be able to hear the presentation I am sitting in or music I am listening to.  I thought it better than to have ear buds in all day.  Not only to they allow more ease of movement the mic works great when I am speaking and sound quality is way better than I could have imagined.  I now use them more for listening to music then planned.
5,The sound quality of these is over the top! If you turn them up while wearing them the base vibrates. Just WOW! Rock on! I could do without the person telling me that the power is on or item is paired. That is disturbing & I was hoping to lose this feature from my previous set. No such luck. The announcement is loud so if I am trying to be quiet it's not possible. The battery doesn't last as long as my previous set but a good 8 hours so pretty good. It does depend on volume. Overall I am thrilled with the sound & how comfortable they are. I know some folks who will be thrilled with these as Christmas gifts.
5,I love this neckband speaker. I watch YouTube videos a lot and this neckband is perfect. Sound is clear. Volume switch/button is easy to locate without looking. I'm even impressed by the range I get; I can walk into the kitchen and grab something without it cutting out. Great purchase.
5,The quality of sound is very good. I like that I can walk around and the speaker comfortably stays in place. Definitely recommend if you are a neck speaker person! Love mine!
5,I love these.  I purchased two before at a lower price and know I would work up to this.  I'm glad I did it this way because I can see the difference in quality from the different models.  This sounds amazing it's super light in weight and sleek in appearance.
5,I love this neckband blue tooth speaker..  Quick delivery and had to contact the company and they went above and beyond to make sure I was satisfied.
4,I bought this for my wife and now want one myself. She put music on and I tried it and thought it sounded very good and then the vocal started and it was really good like I had headphones on.It's louder than I expected for the person not wearing it but it doesn't isolate the wearer as much as headphones do.
4,I've had this for about a week and have maybe 10 hours of use and so far am very pleased by it.Note my primary use for this has been for watching TV and movies on Roku. I'm in my 60's and have some hearing loss and this does a great job of letting me have the TV as loud as I need it without bothering my wife. The dialog intelligibility is great! It is much more comfortable than wearing earbuds or headphones. My only complaint is the control buttons are just a bit too small for my big hands. I also wish it had a big mute button. (It does have volume controls but a mute button would be very convenient)
4,Great sound and convenience. A little short of advertising on battery life. Glad I bought 2 units since tv sound is off when  boomerang is connected
4,So I have two neckband speakers to compare now. This Bugani M115 and the Monster Boomerang.CLIFF NOTES- if you like to exercise with the speakers and can wait for the Bugani M115 to be on sale then buy the M115- if you don't ever plan to exercise with them and are considering each one at their full price buy the Monster Boomerang---------------------WHAT IT DOES BETTER- lighterM115  = 187gBoomerang =  213gyou wouldn't think that makes much of a difference but since the flexible part on the Boomerang is skinnier the speakers tend to flop around specially if you're running making it at annoyance as it bounces on your collar bone. M115 doesn't have this problem.- doesn't have any clothwhen you exercise with these on obviously sweat gets on it. since all the contact points on the M115 is made of plastic or silicone it is easy to wipe off with no traces of sweat. the Boomerang has cloth covering the speakers and it will retain sweat/salt marks after exercise.- buttons are more tactilethe Boomerang's buttons are not as tactile and kind of harder to press- has better volume controlwhenever you adjust the volume on the Boomerang the increments are too large and at times it's either too loud or too quiet and can't adjust to anything in between- can play music standalone (without phone) via SD cardhaven't tested this yet but I'm sure it will come in handy. sometimes I want to listen to music without lugging a phone around.- doesn't turn on at 100% volumefor whatever reason whenever you turn on the Boomerang it is on full blast which makes it a jarring experience when you turn it on in quiet room. same thing for when it automatically turns off due to inactivity a computer voice yells out GOODBYE.---------------------WHAT IT DOES WORSE- does not sound as goodimo the Boomerang sounds much better and definitely has that 3D sound to it. the M115 is not terrible the Boomerang just sounds  better.- terrible instruction manual experiencemanual is black cardboard with very light gold lettering. whoever thought this was a good idea should be fired.- button placement is not as goodalthough the buttons are more tactile than the Boomerang I actually prefer the placement of the buttons on the Boomerang on the side where the M115 has them on the top. easier to click buttons with the thumb IMO.- does not feel as high qualitythe Boomerang speaker itself and its packaging just looks high quality- pricey relative to its sound qualityat full price it is priced very closely to the Monster Boomerang which sounds way better. If you are buying one of them at a time when they are both full priced and you don't ever plan on using them while exercising the Monster Boomerang is the better buy for the sound quality.---------NO OPINIONS ON YET- call quality between the two as I rarely make use of handsfree calling
4,This is a first time I bought a neckband headphone.Build quality is great battery life is perfect.Sound is ok for calls but not so great for music.Its little muffled
5,I bought a second one. Top quality and almost on par with the more expensive Sony version. Better Bluetooth too.
5,I loved it its beyond my expectations and working perfectly for my speaker needs like taking work calls and leisure music etc
5,Love it!!
4,first a disclaimer that i drive big trucks and there are lots of background noise pretty much all the time. i had the monster boomerang before and sadly i lost it in one of the trucks i was using for work which is a random 1 everyday. so i gave this a shot because earbuds just are not comfortable for long hours. headsets are hit and miss and i had one that gave me a headache after an hour of use. the ones around the neck seems more ideal to my needs also because i wear a hat and with a headset i had to take it off and on and off and on and the neck bluetooth eliminates this problem. sound seems nice as does the bass as other people has desired from other models. it is not as load as the boomerang but for basically personal volume it is loud enough. depending of the quality of the music track i have had to turn it down a few percentage. battery life seems good. i was at 100% to about 70% in about 4 hours of music and phone calls. as i mentioned that i had tons of background noise and can hear the other person ok and my friend on the other end can hear me ok it is ok in noisy conditions but will be fine in quieter conditions. the boomerang seems to do a better job in this category even with background noise. the bugani does fit better to my liking. i feel like it will not slide off from regular movement such as getting in and out of the truck many times a day. where as the boomerang felt like it can easily fall off the neck if you are not aware of it. the bugani is close to the top competitors and i will continue to use it as long as i do not lose it in another truck. if someone works from home or where there is not a whole lot of background noise and handles lots of calls then i do not see how they can go wrong with the bugani especially if earbuds or headsets give problems. as some has mentioned that the instructions are red against a black background but it did not bother me. some people may find it more of an annoyance that words do not pop at you and you can read right away this does make you have to adjust to read it but i did not have any issues with it.
5,Great sound quality. Fits great around the neck.
5,It’s true what you’ve read about it. I didn’t see these reviews when I looked (or over looked) it’s very annoying & at 1st you will think there’s something wrong with the unity  there’s a bit of delay from the touch buttons to the actual time it take for the volume to change. There’s a lag which is weird. Also the “max” volume will be at 1/2 volume then when you turn it up the volume will actually decrease!TL;DR not loud enough for the car but good for around the home***update*** I contacted Amazon which put me in contact with Monster. The unit that I had was defective! I’ve since got the Boomerang Petite & all the problems are gone. Really clear & great calls I can listen to it in my car & hear it very well!
4,Only thing I dislike is higher bass tracks or sounds reduce the music or tone I didn't have this problem with Bose soundwear but bose soundwear does run $300.00 plus unlike this being under $100.00.Midrange sound quality is good and clearLike anything else similar keeping the volume down a couple clicks will make the battery life last longer averaging 7 hrs or so.
4,The sound quality is great for podcasts and audio books. This thing is loud. The one issue it has it always starts at 3/4 volume which is loud if I am trying not to wake people up
5,Nice one to have
4,I like that the neck portion is flexible not hard. I tried my son's before ordering my own and liked it right away. I was really surprised at how good the sound is. When my son said I should try it I was doubtful but that doubt was erased once I tried it.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I absolutely love the cool unique style and design of the boomerang neck speaker. It is so easy to use and comfortable. It is Bluetooth and wireless so the setup is super simple. It really packs a punch in the sound department.It has a long distance 33 feet of range and the sound quality is crystal clear. It has a very long battery life and provides up to 30 hours of continuous use. The surface is made of soft memory silicone for superior comfort which also adjust to your neck size. It is IPX7 waterproof which is perfect for outdoor sports and water. Awesome price and value. Very pleased and highly recommend
5,So far so good
5,I’ve been looking for a good Bluetooth option for my workouts. I hate earbuds and headphones tend to block out too much when I’m outside.These are the perfect in between. Not too heavy so I barely notice they’re even on. Sound quality is good. Better than I was expecting. And I can still hear my surroundings.Great for watching movies on my kindle in bed as sometimes I find it hard to get comfortable with my headphones depending on how I lay.I keep the volume just below halfway and get about 6-7 hours of battery.I haven’t had any issues with limiter cutoff like some other reviews.

I’ve got a ton of them and they’re all great but the noise cancelling becomes too much sometimes!  I can’t hear anything.I got this so I can still hear the world around me. Now the con is that people hear what you’re listening too. I plan to use these when I’m cooking outside by myself and want to listen to an audio book though.They’re light and not a nuisance in my shoulders.
3,Constantly skides around and wants to fall off. It’s too large for a females neck and shoulders
4,Hi everyone. This is going to be a mixed review because of good and bad things First off I bought them because of a new work policy that I can't have a Bluetooth phone or earbud in my ear. Unobstructed ears. So I bought the wearable speaker as we can Have a radio in our trucks and listen to them but I'm a trash man and I had getting out of the truck and missing parts of a broadcast.Ok First off. The speakers come with a manual. I'm sad to say its Worthless because they printed it on Black paper with a reddish text so I honestly thought they had sent a folder piece of paper till I turned it and the letters were caught by the light. I'm old I Couldn't ready it at all.Now I bought the speakers for two reasons. I listen to audiobooks and talk radio. Worthless to me. In the quiet of my house I can hear the hosts talking and I can hear my books. In a truck or at the back loading trash I can't understand anything being said. So on the 5-star scale its rates a 2.As I said this is a mixed review. I wanted to be fair and I switched to IHeart and turned it to Classic Rock.Very clear. The speakers would vibrate slightly with the base but I think that helped transmit. When the DJs talked they were a little hard to understand but if I focused I could understand so going back to the 5-star rating Music play rates a 5.I listened to it the whole day and I still have a quarter battery so Battery life is good.Sadly for My uses this does not meet my requirements.If you are buying this item for Music play then I would recommend but if you are buying for books or talk radio I suggest you try something else.
5,I used it for games and video. I like it.
4,I love them. I work for a major retailer and nobody in management has had an issue with me wearing them. Granted I don't use them when dealing with people/customers that's where pause button comes in handy.Your mileage may vary but I find these comfortable enough to sleep in. They aren't perfect but adequate enough for a side sleeper like myself.If you're into binaural beats for sleepless nights or insomnia these are stereo speakers and may work well for you.People complaining about not being able to hear podcasts might do well in finding the equalizer settings on their phone or audio app and reducing the bass or something else. I listen to talks all thetime I can hear voices just fine without any tweaks.If there is anything that can be improved it is some sort of clasp or locking mechanism to prevent these from falling off your neck. These are not yoga friendly they will fall off in certain poses. If you recline your head too far back you risk having these fall off. I'm betting the other brands are not much better if at all in this regard.These speakers can be recharged while simultaneously being used.I hope neck speakers become more popular. There seems to be a lack of different good brand choices for neck speakers. a little brand competition would perhaps increase the quality and options available.
2,I was so thrilled to receive this neck speaker at first but after I received it and tried it out I was on the fence about keeping it or returning it. Since I got it for around $55 with instant coupon I ended up keeping it. Here’s the problem…. it has a limiter that kicks in more often than not while listening to music. Even at half volume it does this making the music listening experience quite unpleasant. Why am I keeping it you might ask? Because I watch a lot of movies on my desktop pc and the speaker does do a really good job with movies. They sound crisp ambients sound great an voices sound clear. So anyway if you are looking at this strictly or mainly for music I’d look elsewhere if I was you. If you’re a movie buff and want something a little personal that isn’t gonna disturb the entire household this is perfect. Now some songs sound good don’t get me wrong but a lot of of songs will make you question wtf is up with said device when that limiter kicks in. As far as the shipping goes presentation of the product no complaints there. The shipping was hella fast with Amazon Prime it came in a nice well made white box with charging cable. I hope this review helps.
5,I was in search of a headset and glad I made a good choice...the bass for the headset is really good. Box includes a small type c cable manual and headset. The only issue i noticed was it was a little heavy while holding it  and I wish they provided a small carry case for this.
5,I am a podcast listener every day when I am in the house. I listen when I clean and am moving around but usually have something playing on my stationary Echo device (Alexa) or larger Bose Bluetooth speaker. When you are moving from room to room you miss parts of the podcast stories. I don't like to wear headphones so I can hear what is going on around me like if someone comes to the door or the dog needs to go out. These speakers are so handy because you can listen no matter which room you move to and don't feel like you are cut off from whats going on around you.I select a podcast put my phone in my pocket and move all around the house and yard and don't miss a thing. They are surprisingly loud too if you need them to be. It is possible to sit these speakers on the table and use them as you would a regular bluetooth speaker for more then one person to listen to. I like them on my shoulders because it keeps the speaker not blasting loud but exactly where I need the sound to be to hear everything.The speakers come packaged nicely in a box. They are comfortable and fit the curves in your shoulders so that they sit in a good place. The speakers feel stable like they aren't going to fall off. It took a minute to get used to them being there but after you do you don't really realize that they are on you. They are light weight enough that you forget they are there. They connected to bluetooth in a few seconds and were easy to figure out. I took them on a weekend getaway and they are small enough to go with you anywhere but loud enough if you need them to be.
5,I've never owned a neckband speaker before so this is a first for me. I've gotta say I am pretty impressed by the sound quality this thing has. It's not home theatre sound obviously but it's waaay better than the built in phone speaker. Movies on it are great on it lying in bed. It's comfortable as well can barely tell its there.
2,The feel is OK. Materials are good. It's fairly light on the neck. It was probably my best connecting Bluetooth item interestingly enough.The sound could be much better. Don't get this if you're requiring HQ sound as it has a narrow frequency range. That said I used it to walk my dog mostly which it works great for. The sound drowns out if there are cars going by. I can't hear it at work (machine shop). Podcasts and such work best as music gets limited by the sound frequency. I haven't bothered to watch a movie with it but am sure it wouldn't be anything spectacular. I really wish it sounded better but you can't complain at this price point.Battery life is good but I would prefer a bigger battery.Unfortunately mine stopped working after about a year. It powers on but there's a zap sound from the speakers and nothing not even connectivity. Don't know why just started doing it one day. 2 stars for just a year of life.
5,Light weight  comfortable and sounds great. I wanted something other then ear buds and this is it.
4,I love this speaker it sounds great and lasts forever. It's perfect for a factory setting and comfortable. The two stars are a warning as I've not even had it 45 days and the left speaker went out. I've emailed bugani with my issue and will test their customer service. I will update my review accordingly. Edit: as promised I updated this review. They did respond though slowly walked me through troubleshooting  (though I knew it was mechanical not bluetooth or charging) but after jumping through a few small hoops they did indeed send me a brand new one got it yesterday. Four stars because I really do like this product I bought a Monster Boomerang to replace the bugani but the bugani just sounds better to me especially in a factory.  Will update again if this one breaks fingers crossed it won't though. P.s. I didn't even get to try the whole SD card thing yet.
5,I have bought multiple Monster products in the past and have always had grwat results from them. High quality sound and durability.
5,i got these a few months ago because i needed to be able to hear traffic around me while riding my bike and onewheel around town while listening to music. the price was significantly cheaper than the bose model and other comparable products.i honestly was not expecting much from these i had never heard of the company but they were well reviewed on here so i gave them a shot. i am really blown away by how great these sound.the bass can be slightly "farty" at full blast (making it 4/5 stars for me) but a little tweaking of the EQ settings on my media player (shoutout to PowerAmp app on andriod) fixed that right up.  these really do sound fantastic and create a nice sound bubble around your head that is significantly louder for the wearer compared to what others hear. pairs nicely with a hoodie.as far as the waterproof rating i have not quite gotten them wet but they fill my bathroom with great sound while sitting on the sink in steamy showers with no problem whatsoever.the battery life is amazing and they charge quickly and they are pretty much weightless i often forget that i have them on when powered off or turned all the way down. they stay comfortably in place even on rocky rides. i honestly can't recommend these speakers enough i am very very happy with this purchase.
4,This thing held up well but I was curious about it's "competitor" the Oraolo which is the same price. The difference between the two is mostly in sound quality and volume. Oraolo is louder and creamer when turned up all the way. It is a bit bulkier and a bit heavier but it's way better. Also cooler looking if that matters to you. I returned the Bugani and I'm glad I did. The strange thing is both speakers have the same noises they make... Is this is illusion of choice? I don't know but I like loud music and the Bugani didn't stand up to it's .. uhh.. sister product. One more thing the battery like seems a bit better on the Bugani prolly because it doesn't go as loud.
5,What a liberating speaker for bicyclists. The sound is excellent with a bone massaging base. This neckband speaker means nothing in your ears except for the music.
5,Great sound and quality
5,The Bugani Wearable Bluetooth Speakers sound good and you can definitely feel the Bass since it is touching your collarbone. Almost like the Woojer concept. I got this to replace my Wonderboom (definitely not as loud as my Wonderboom). I was told I was being annoying with my music blasting during group rides on park trails. I can hear it loud enough through the wind noise but not broadcasting it out for everyone else to hear. I can't use earplugs because I'm wearing a full face helmet and I need to hear my surrounding too. The good thing is the Pairing Process is very simple and easy to do. The bad thing is the freaking instructions it is printer on Card Stock black paper with Gray Ink (cause I can't tell the color). You can read the small text by reflective light of the black paper.Update: I ended up using this BT speaker for day to day for driving and at the office for phone calls mostly. Occasionally for music when I have time. I try to charge it every night but it can keep going the next whole day even if I do forget to charge the night before. This is still a good BT speaker for the price but not as good as the privacy aspect of the $200+ Bose or JBL version. Privacy as in people around you cannot hear the sound. People around you can definitely hear your speakers.
4,I'm giving these speakers 4 stars.  The connectivity is great and the sound quality is good.  They stay around my neck and don't fall off easily as I move around with them.The loss of a star is from one thing only. The user manual isn't readable. I would like one that is. If there is one and I am able to read and use the product I will upgrade my review. If not it will be returned. It IS comfortable on my neck. Hopefully a user guide is available so I can keep and use it....  I have no idea if I can answer my phone with it.Without the instructions I have had to fiddle with it to figure out how to do the basic functions.  Hint. Hold the power button in to turn it on. Volume buttons are obvious and the triangle pauses function. Any other use is a secret that only a decoder can decipher....
4,This is the first type of wearable speakers I've bought.  The bass is outstanding and the sound quality is wonderful.  I mostly listen to old time radio from the 40's-50's so the recordings are old and not the best quality.  With these speakers I have no problem understanding the spoken program.  It is a bit weird for me to turn my head and find that the sound is cancelled from the side I turned away from.  For example if I turn my head to the right I no longer hear from the left.  It's not the speakers it's just the way sound works and the directional orientation of the speakers.I guess you can always find a negative with any product so having said that the only negative for me is the weight around my neck.  I did understand these weigh more than others but I'm sure I'll get used to it in time.
5,One question a lot of people ask is "why would I buy this?".Around the neck speakers such as this are great in situations where you *can* use speakerphone but it may be rude or difficult to listen to stuff at a volume you'd prefer or you want better sound quality than your mobile speakers. The bugani speakers are particularly good for the former situation as they are designed to aim sound towards the wearer. It isn't going to be totally silent to others but it is not as loud or obtrusive as if you had just put your audio on speakerphone.One other excellent thing about the bugani speakers is that the body is completely silicone making it really easy to disinfect (such as if you use it during exercise or in a lab environment etc).The one downside of Bugani speakers is that while it has good audio quality it is not nearly as good as say the Monster boomerang. Don't get me wrong it is still great quality sound but it's more like a 4.5/5 instead of 5/5.If you are in a situation where around-the-neck speakers are useful the bugani speaker isn't a bad way to go.
3,I don’t like that I have to turn it all the way up in order to hear the words
4,these are super comfortable and have a pretty good volume. I purchased two since I throw the extra in my backpack so I don't have to charge while using it as I ride my electric unicycle. I really like the product but after about six months one of the two units I purchased is starting to crackle on the right speaker. I use these while riding my electric unicycle and have recommended this particular model to many others in the electric unicycle community on Facebook and Reddit. I'd like to get the one having issues replaced.I really like the product but after about six months one of the two units I purchased is starting to crackle on the right speaker.

5,They seem a little louder than the bose ones. I was fishing and dropped them in the water no problem.  Everyone I've let try them wants them three people ordered it. So I love them so far.
4,I love its not even noticeable on my neck and I have an extremely sensitive neck that always hurts so the comfort is huge!  Directions aren't the greatest but it was really easy to figure out and I'm no techie so I dont know why some reviewer say it was hard.  People said it sounded much better to them than when I just used speaker phone.  The charging cord is really tight fit so I can see where that might be a problem in the future because I felt like I had to force it in and out.  Only used it a few days so far.  Wore it while gardening in 90+ degree sun and forgot it was even there.
5,Battery lasts about 6 hours if you have the volume at like 30%. The higher you have the volume the faster the battery dies. It is very comfortable around the neck.
4,I recently discovered these neck speakers after experiencing some issues with ear allergies when wearing AirPods. I bought these and a Monster Boomerang that was on sale for the same price. I use this to primarily listen to audio books and music while working around the house and on walks. It works great for that and allows you to hear the world around you for safety. It also pairs well with the TV for quieter listening. The sound quality is actually excellent; the build quality is just ok but the plastic construction makes it very light to wear. Honestly I forget that I have it on. Some suggested improvements: switch to USB-C for charging add a way to activate SIRI add some contrast to the button section to make it easier to see and use. I haven't tested the water-proofing.
4,Disclaimer: This is a gift. I have not used it personally nor has the gift recipient.I did however open the box to charge the unit prior to wrapping and gifting. It has nice packaging so the unboxing experience feels like you're getting a quality product (whether it is or not). The speaker itself is sleek-looking lightweight and felt surprisingly natural and very comfortable when wearing. I was skeptical to see if it would stay on while doing chores/gardening etc...  I tried to shake it off without success and even when bending over it stayed securely in place. Looks good so far. I am eager to see how well it functions. Let you know with a follow-up once the gift has been given.
3,I bought this was a backup for my blue-tooth over the ear headset which can get heavy feeling after many hours of Teams calls.  While the sound is great for watching TV YouTube or playing computer games this headset is not great at Teams conference calls.  Sometimes it connects really well and both sides are clear - but many times I got feedback and echos on my end.  I couldn't figure out the reason for this intermittent issue so I couldn't solve for it.  I use these when I'm only listening to work calls but have to go back to my original headset for talking.  But I like switching to these for post-work viewing which helps reduce the weight on my ears.
2,To be fair my expectations for these speakers were kinda high. Given a 70 dollar price point I think that may be appropriate. They are not bad as such. They are only slight uncomfortable to wear which is well within reason. The sound quality is awful-to-middling. This is due to the high degree of directionality of their output which will change every time you breathe while sitting in a chair. I have not tried jogging in them but I would put money on them sounding even worse. If you can neck-dance them into alignment the sound is okayish. The bluetooth range is decent; I get like 30'. They are STUPID LOUD when you first turn them on. There is no way to stop this from happening. So if the point of wearable speakers for you is say to watch TV or play video games without disturbing your sleeping wife well tough. The controls are okay if you have upgraded to cybereyes or you memorize their positions on the device. (The same can be said oddly for the instruction manual.) On a related note the packaging was design by an aesthetician who has people open his packages for him so as to preserve his manicure. It really does look pretty; I would include a picture but mine doesn't look so pretty anymore as I had to destroy it to get it open.  Battery life is excellent; I have used them for days (off and on) on a single charge.You may be wondering if you can use these around another human being without disturbing them. If you don't have to turn them on (see above) you have a chance. At 50% volume if well-enough aligned (see above) you can hear reasonably well in a quiet room. In these same conditions someone could kinda hear what's going on from 15' away. From like 30' or so it is basically inaudible.
5,I am so impressed at how long this battery lasts. I find it very comfortable to wear and often forget I even have it around my neck like when a recording ends.The sound is great and the range is much farther than my old Bluetooth headset. I can go from one end of my home to the other and not lose the signal.It doesn't bother my ears like the ones you insert and I can still hear what is happening around me without those around me having to hear what I am listening to. Of course if I have it loud enough those around can hear it too so it is not private unless I turn the volume way down. But that makes sense as it is broadcasting into the air and not directly into my ears.I hope to enjoy it for a long time to come.
2,Battery life wasn't 12 hours at advertisedstopped working after one weekdid sound good while it lasted but tried to make phone calles but the person on the line could not hear meI tried reseting itno dice.
4,To be honest this is one of the best of neck speakers I've purchased and I've bought maybe 5 now. I was impressed the right off the Jump with the packaging. By far the best sound quality and bass of any of them the BASS is especially surprising considering most don't have any. I think it's pretty wild how you can turn the volume down to where only you can hear this and clearly too. My only qualm is there's no hands-free activation of your Google assistant or Siri that would be a bold move and really the only problem I've seen so far.
4,You can't compare these to the Bose version these have poor bass quality and sound tinny.  Bugani customer service was great they sent me their newer version of these under the Monster brand name and they do sound much better.
3,The product for the price isn't bad.First to note this product is not good with a 4.0 bluetooth transmitter; actually total trash with BT 4.0. I got a 5.0 BT transmitter and the audio loss issue was MUCH better - not perfect. It still has the periodic cut out.The sound overall is quite good. However the design has some delivery flaws. The speakers lack the surround sound effect and not as intense due to the angle of the speakers pointing up around your ears and not angles toward your ears. Oddly when I looped it over my head and the speakers behind the ears it was quite nice sound. The other option could be a detachable  strap (velcro?) That pulls both sides together under your chin. I tried this and that also improved sound delivery.The instructions use totally faded gold/yellow on semigloss black background which makes reading the instructions stupid. But pretty self explanatory if you have some technical saavy. Top most button turns on/off the next one down is volume up third one down is volume down and the bottom is play/pause.
4,5 stars as sound quality goes but the microphone makes isn't great for phone calls. The spot are really good. It's like a surround sound system for your head. My elderly dad really likes them too though they do tend to slip off of his big ol neck
5,It's like having music in your head all day only you can still hear cars coming at you and or words! Has great sound! If you can cut the lower end bass off with some sources and wow!! Usually stuff under 125 htz will mess with them at max volume but you'll feel the bass in your shoulders. Won't annoy those around you but you might catch them jamming to the rhythm when you walk by!If you guys could make one with a bit more low end bass or with something close to skullcandy crusher tech that will let you feel the bass more that would be incredible!***Update 6 months after purchase***I wear these every day! Love it! Thanks again for a solid product!! Sound is still amazing after all rainy days we been through and the falls it's taken!!
5,Thank you so very much for everything ❤️❤️❤️
5,I like the feel and the weight. The sound quality is great it's loud enough to overpower noisy environments and the stereo effects are awesome. Also the bass is nothing to complain about. Coming from wearing a JBL clip 3 on my hip for the last few years this thing is practically mind blowing.So far the only thing I wish was different was the size I would like a smaller version that I could conceal under the collar of my work shirt. Oh and a higher water proof rating I work outside in all weather conditions. I bought this solely to wear at work because headphones are not permitted safety reasons.I just purchased this so I'll update later after I've had time to put it to the test.
4,I like how it was covered with a soft silicone material and it was comfortable to wear.  For a budget product it didn't feel or look cheap at all.  The sound was great for the price.  It was leaning more towards the bass side.  I'll try to mess with the my EQ to get more treble if needed.  Calls were coming in clear from the caller and the recipient.  Over all I was happy with my purchase.
4,After waiting for some time for a replacement for a faulty headset I can truly say that the Bugani M115 wearable bluetooth headset is an awesome product.  I wear it all day at home and out and about and it provides me with great sound while listening to Spotify YouTube and other apps.  It's also convenient to answer phone calls from it.  At a reasonable price  it's a product that I would give as a gift.
5,I operate heavy equipment. Some of which are loud and ride very rough. I have tried stand alone bluetooth speakers ear buds and bone conduction earphones. Never knew neck speakers existed so i took a chance. Best damn decision i have made in a while. The Bugani neck speakers are fantastic. Jammed out all day with battery charge to spare. Did not even have to run at max volume while operating my machine. Barely knew i was wearing something around my neck. Great product and thnx to Prime i had them overnight. To my surprise there was a box to check said $20.00 off at checkout made my purchase that much better.
4,This speaker is comfortable and works great with good sound quality.  I highly recommend this product the only thing I did not like is the instruction manual because the gold wording on the black paper is impossible to read but the pdf manual worked just fine because you can enlarge the photo for an easy read.
3,The sound is decent and I am able to walk around my entire apartment without losing bluetooth signal.  However the device does not have bass/treble level adjustments.  If there is an app for the device I have yet to find it.  Another person noted the horrible color contrast (or more appropriately lack thereof) with the little user manual.  I also note that the Bugani website does not even list this product in any way.  When contacting the company to see if there there was a way to adjust levels the response I received made it quite clear that the person responding is not fully proficient in the English language.  At this point I have yet to decide if I will send it back.
5,I didn't want to spend $300 on a BOSE pair so figured I'd try these. I do a lot of running and walking in my neighborhood and don't like wearing AirPods due to the number of cars that pass me. I wanted something that had good sound and allowed me to hear and  be aware of the traffic as well. These were the answer to what I needed. The sound is great and there is also bass and I can still hear everything around me. I was impressed with the clarity of the music and other stuff I listen to. And they stay secure around you neck without bouncing around. Highly recommend these.
4,Excited to try it. It looks exactly as described. I do wish the charging cable was longer and a C cable for easier charging. Looking forward to hearing how the audio sounds. Also wish there was some kind of hook to loop it all the way around your neck for someone like me who moves around the house and bends randomly to pick things up m
3,Let me lead with that I really liked this body speaker but had to replace it after 3 months because it will not charge. Maybe it's under warrantee I'll never know because it's not worth the datamining form to register or the the shipping and handling fees to return for repair.I have since moved on but let me elaborate on what I liked and disliked. I liked that it was the the most comfortable of the 3 Bodyspeakers that I have bought had good range and was easy to use. I dislike that it was micro-USB that the charging port was crazy deep and had zero traction on the plug. Also what's with the rubber plug to waterproof the port. It's the 21st century can no one build a port that can get wet. It's DC electric it should work under water.
5,I was surprised at how good these sound.I bought them with use for zoom meetings and they are clear for that. These also are fine for watching TV  programs consisting of mostly dialog. They are pleasant to listen to for extended time and are barely noticeable while wearing.  Most acoustic music (Classical/Folk) sounds very realistic as well.The sound is really quite good but they don't reach as low as my over-the-ear headphones do. In short very nice sounding but lacking fullness on material with lower bass or Action/Adventure movie LFE filled passages. Still for the price and comfort an excellent option!
4,I lost my hearing in one ear so this is a good alternative when walking or biking so I can hear traffic .  It connects easily.  However the buttons and the + - power are hard to read.  I think when I get more used to them they will be fine although they are a little hard to push when wearing them.  Sound quality is pretty good though.
3,For my taste the sound had too much mids and not enough bass or treble. Maybe that’s me — I always like the bass and treble turned all the way up.I was able to turn up the treble and make it sound better if I was using an app that had its own equalizer. I couldn’t turn the bass up at all it immediately became distorted. I would not describe this as “explosive bass” like it says on the box.I think maybe none of these devices will satisfy me and this is as good as it gets.I thought the little rubber flap that covers the USB charging port is delicate and tricky to put in securely. I’d be worried maybe I’d accidentally leave a crack that could let water in.
4,This comfortable wearable soeaker allows me to listen to iPad or phone without disturbing others. Good sound good battery charge. However TERRIBLE unreadable directions (tiny orange copper color writing  printed on dark brown) are impossible to read and controls (slightly raised black silicone on black silicone) are difficult to see read or feel. This is an example if the worst of aesthetics distorting function.
3,I want to give this item a 5 star rating. Everything about the product and how I used it impressed me. You might have read that and wondered why you only see 3 stars if I loved this product so much. Well let me tell you I bought this item in September of 2020 and used it at work to have some music to work to. For this the product was outstanding. But here we are in January 2021 4 months later and this product has stopped working. Literally from one day to the next. I am disappointed to say the least. My first thought was to buy another but for the price I feel like I should get more the 4 months of use. Bottom line is it gets 3 stars because it was great but didn't last. So very disappointing.
4,Easy to use sounds is good. Doesn't fit as well around my neck as another brand I had but it stays on during yardwork so that's good! Connection has dropped out a few times but always seems to come back without intervention.
4,Sound quality and battery life are excellent. The only reasons why I provided a 4-star rating are that it would be much improved with a USB-C connection instead of the provided USB-micro the instruction manual is absolutely illegible and the controls require me to remove the unit to see what control button I'm pressing as the tactile distinction between them doesn't exist for my fingers. I do recommend this product though.
5,My dad requested a wearable speaker that does not require a phone. After spend hours and hours of search it’s the only wearable speaker I can find in the market that accepts tf card support bluetooth and have good feedback. I decided to give a try. My dad said he likes it a lot. Sound quality is good. Volume can be adjusted from whisper to very loud. He can play using his card or connect to a phone or tv. Happy with this purchase!
5,I needed to be more active...well this is the solution...I put them on....connect to Pandora....and off I go to do chores....great motivator. They stay on while doing house and yard work....I even forget I am wearing them!!Wish the volume would go a bit higher...and when I connect to my Roku TV ... the lag is noticeable from when a person speaks and I hear the audio...and I didn't think it through that the distance is only 33ft...so they don't work unless I carry my cell phone in my pocket....but really... if these are my only complaints...I have nothing to complain about....Great product....great tone...great wearabilityI am more than satisfied
5,A Friend recommended it. He wears it while working. He showed it to us and we decided it would be good to have around and that the grandkids would like to use it as well.Works great haven’t used it much yet but am happy with the purchase.Since writing this review I’ve had plenty of time to try it out. They work wonderfully. I’ve used them while doing yard work and some cleaning around the house. It’s a very refreshing way to listen to music or Do podcasts. I thoroughly enjoy them.
5,I bought these because earbuds are not allowed at my husband’s work (he works in a warehouse; it’s a safety issue). It’s also very loud with all the machines so he’s  not always able to hear bluetooth speakers.  My husband says these wearable speakers work perfectly. Loud and clear sound. Great sound quality too for both music and podcasts. Battery life is great too. He charges it at night and it lasts the whole work day.
3,I expected to use this speaker for private conversations or listen to music privately. I thought maybe my phone was not on the right setting. I tried everything including support from my phone carrier with no avail.  I tried it on my husband's phone also. I contacted Bugani thinking mb it was not working correctly. Bugani sent me another one and still same issue. So it is great to listen to music and phone conversations however it is very difficult if you expect it to be private. You have to turn the volume down so slow it is hard to hear the conversation. Also seems to have a long battery life. Bugani was very helpful and sent me another speaker immediately.
5,The neckband speaker is comfortable and light weight.  I barely notice that I have it around my neck.  Sound is good with a decent bass.  Call made on it is very clear.  The other end can hear you good as well. Battery last a long time.  Start using it with 60 % when I received it.  I been playing it for abut 4 hours listening to pendora and battery still have 50% left.  Over all you can not go wrong buying this instead of bose.  Less expensive with good sound and clear voice call.
5,I have hearing issues n it mostly seems I can't understand what is being said when watching tv/movies. With the speakers up close i do ever so much better. The sound is really nice n clear.When trying to watch the Hobbit on Blueray there was a big lag with voices n couldn't use the band. BUT!!!!Watching tv movies an anthing (netfix hboprime disney) positively no issues everything matched up. I will keep this band n am very happy with it. I really like the sound the looks weight n how easy to use an pair.
4,So far so good.  Used it once outside and once inside.  Others can hear way more than I expected especially indoors.  Sound quality was better than expected and it paired with an iPod touch without issue.  Battery life is untested as well as durability since I just got this a few days ago.
4,I just received it so far so good
4,It has a nice sound. Not as full of a sound as the comparable Bose unit. I also have an Avantree unit and the Bugani unit is comparable to it but at a much better price.
5,Haven't used the product I received. I coworker let me try his so I ordered one to see how I liked it. Just received and currently charging. After writing this review I used the speaker and like it a lot. It has good sound and connectivity and allows me to hear ambient sounds clearly. A little more volume would be nice since I can't hear it in my car at 130 MPH but what do you want. My girl friend says it's great for watching TV without bothering other people.
4,Good product for elderly lady with bad hearing. Like how there isn’t any echo with the tv.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The sound quality is good inside with little ambient noise. But outside you have to crank up the volume because of traffic noise. The battery lasts me 2 full 8 hour days of work on a full charge. I have yet to get the system wet in the rain it never rains in California! But sweat doesn’t seem to bother these speakers. I would recommend these to anyone who asks about them.
5,These were a gift for my husband for Christmas. His works in HVAC and doesn’t have a radio in his van... he didn’t see these coming and since receding them he is able to drive and talk on the phone as well as listen to his radio through Bluetooth connection with his phone. He LOVES them!The quality is perfect for him and it holds a charge for at least a week he says. My ear pods don’t even stay charged that long!I highly recommend.
4,Very high douche-factor if wearing in public.  You just look silly.  Who cares?  It’s really practical and I haven’t found any drawbacks yet.  Going to try it while driving a convertible with the top down...  That’s the real test.
5,I love its bass. Never knew such speaker can produce a bass that add life to music and movie. Listening is believing. The shoulder speaker rest comfortably around your neck and shoulder. I've used other brand of shoulder speaker but Bugani have it all. I look forward use other speakers produced by Bugani.
4,I was nervous about this purchase because so many Bluetooth speakers are below par especially when it comes to bass but this is amazing. Hopefully the battery is just as amazing. I can't give 5 stars or a 10 until I've had more time to use this
5,It looks feels and sounds great.  I had a similar product from from another vendor which I loved but the charging port failed.  Could not get their people to respond.  Hopefully this will hold up better and/or you will be more responsive if I have a problem.I love the location for great sound but allows me to be alert to traffic or situational noise.
5,It's good for walking better than headphones because you can still hear things around you in combination with the music so it's safer that's the main reason to use these and take phone calls with the speakerphone it has a safe volume not too loud but has a little bit of Bass they have great customer service I had a problem with mine and they sent me one within a week a new one I was so happy no hassles anyways this is my third bugani purchase I highly recommend it to everybody the price is good for the good quality
4,It sounds good better than the Oraolo M110. Using it now while writing this. I recently moved to an apartment and can't listen to my music like I used too.  This speaker lets me listen to my music with out bugging my neighbors. I love it! I would buy it again.
4,Good sound comfortable excellent battery life. My only complaint is it could be louder. It does play pretty loud don't get me wrong I would like it to be louder though.
5,Arrived today 1st March 2021 and It does was it says on the till. The base is very noticeable as compared to my 2 generic wearable speakers and you can feel the speakers vibration which is very good. Good value for money.Keep up the good work !......................Just an update today 19 March 2021 my bugani blutooth stop working and doesnt power on ! Very sad and disappointed at all and so it goes to one star !
5,I bought these to eliminate the need to use ear buds/plugs on conference calls.  So far so good.  Clear sound for using on conference calls.  I'm told my voice (from the mic) is also clear when I speak.  Note ... should be used in a relatively quiet room as these seem to be more sensitive to room noise than more conventional ear plugs/buds I've used.  I pair these directly to my laptop and haven't tried them paired to my phone.
5,Brought this product for my husband for Christmas and he absolutely loves it. He’s going deaf in one ear and these speakers has allowed him to watch TV without blasting the TV itself. I can sit next to him and hear the TV through the speakers as well. He says they are comfortable and the sound quality is good. Definitely recommend if you have a significant other who likes the TV extremely loud.
4,I have not tried it yet but I like the way it fits
4,I like the concept. It’s slightly heavy.
5,I love wearing this while I do housework. Just wish there were a way to secure it or have it not slip and slide so much while bending And reaching.
5,I'm very pleased with this.  I got it to wear when I'm in the street and need to be able to hear background sound like traffic and when I'm working around the house out of the range of my outdoor speakers.  It pairs easily.  The controls are simple.  The sound is surprisingly good. Taking phone calls is easy and I've had no complaints about the quality of the calls.
4,It sounds good. My family and I are enjoying it.
5,Did not expect this to be something I would use all the time.  Just driving or mowing. This thing is GREAT!!!  You can just set it down and listen anywhere. Great bass! I Just bought another one. I always get two or three of something I like.
4,I need more time with this product. So far so good.
5,It's great! My husband has one of the larger bluetooth speakers that he can carry around sort of like a boom box but I hesitated using that description and we love that product. Then he tried the wearable speaker and I really liked it because I love to talk hands free! The wearable speaker is perfect for me too!
5,I love the wearable speakers! The sound is amazing. I can sit in the same room with someone else with volume where I can hear and they don't know I have it on! Love the battery life don't about the water resistant feature just yet cause I haven't been in such a situation.  Bought a total of 3 and they love them too! Would definitely buy again!!
5,I love this product because it lets me listen to podcasts while being aware of my surroundings.  I can also listen to a podcast in the dining room while my family watches TV in the connected living room without distraction.  I am aware when I hear the words "MOM!?" unlike having earphones.
5,We looked at a lot of options to hear the TV better without blowing out those with better hearing. This fit the bill very well. Works great and has multiple uses besides just the TV. Sound is good in the ranges from Treble to Bass. The only issue is that some TV programs have lousy audio no matter what you use. I have recommended this to a number of people and no one has de-friended me yet! (grin).
5,It's bigger than the picture very nice will be trying it out on my bike and already useing it for my xbox. Need to add how good it handles the base or bass played music for ten hours and still had 50% battery left and its water resistance just don't swim in it way better than eye plug head phones.
4,Great product and good value for the price. Speakers aren't as good as I expected
5,Everybody tells me turn it down or put the headphones on... Well I don't like headphones they hurt my ears... I tried this product and I think it's great...Nobody tells me to turn it down or use my headphones anymore... Now I can hear all of it really good without bothering anybody else in the room...
3,I have enjoyed using the speaker when I walk and hike. It is very good though it "revirbs" at loud bass. But that's not why I gave it 1 star. The real reason is that as many others have posted the manual is printed in faded gold letters on black paper and is virtually unreadable. I've blown up the manual; and attached it in six images. Hope this helps you.Edit - Nov 29 2020 -- Seller contacted me and said they have changed manufacturers. So perhaps the unreadable manual issue is fixed. I don't know if that's true. Perhaps newer reviewers will report on this issue
5,The sound is very nice!  Two of my sisters have purchased this since testing mine out.  And a couple neighbors have expressed interest though I don't know as of this review if they've purchased it.
4,I just received but I'm pleased with build quality and sound. Not as bassy as I had hoped but still acceptable.
5,Very ergonomical and fits around your neck nicely. I've tried Monsters Boomerang and although the lows are better I could tell it was on me unlike the Bugani. Also the Bluetooth range is GREAT. Had my phone on the first floor and I was on the third floor without issue.
5,I like that it’s soft and bendable and has good sound. I will be using it for Brainspotting and EMDR and Trauma work during therapy sessions.
5,Item was packaged very well. High quality box and instructions. It was very easy to power up and pair with my phone and with my iPad. Sound quality had been great and so far battery life has been excellent. I've used it while doing chores around the house. It makes washing dishes or doing laundry much more enjoyable. Sits comfortable on the neck and can be written for a long time with no worries.
5,I use these at work and I never get any complaints from others and I hear everything just fine and when you are alone you can really Jam out.
4,Sounds a little muffled.  I had to adjust me equalizer everytime i switch to the neck speaker.
2,I’m a big fan of dubstep music. But when the bass drops the volume also drops to where I only feel vibrations but can’t hear any of the music. Will be returning for a refund.
5,Love the sound quality and that bass boost. I'm standing next to ppl and it sounds like I have ear buds but everyone near me barely hears anything at all.Love using this while I'm mowing the lawn.
5,Sounds great. Connects to my Bluetooth easly and the range was great. Good replacement for headphones if you need to be able to hear in an emergency. And depending on the volume no one else can really hear what you are playing unless they are right on you.
5,Great product comfort is perfect . I were this at work . If I was to change anything  is that the four buttons . I would place two buttons on each side . I will buy Bugani product again.
4,I like how compact it is the smoothness of the neck band and the speaker quality is pretty good. Easy to connect with my phone.
5,This a a great wearable speaker. For the price it is worth it. I have the Bose wearable speaker which is pricey and the Bugani has the similar sound. It is very light weight with great sound.
5,My husband bought this for work and he absolutely loves it! He works in a machine shop and says the volume is perfect for just him to hear. He also says that the battery life is around 21 hours of use. Definitely recommend this purchase.
5,I’ve enjoyed my bugani waterproof speaker that I use on the boat for almost 2 years now although it’s rusted a tad on the speaker rivets I still get good battery life and quality sound
5,This product sounds amazing! Pairs quickly and easily to your device and roku. It is flexible unlike other similar products. It is really comfortable to wear and the sound is more like a personal audio experience instead of sharing with others. You won't be disappointed in this purchase!
4,Quality and feel high quality do t even know you have them in. Instructions in black paper is bad. I cant read them at all
4,Sound quality
5,The length of the speakers around the neck are perfect I purchased a different set at 1st and had to return it because it was just not long enough and would fall off this set is loud good base and comfortable to wear.
5,Sound quality battery life and Bluetooth connectivity are all good. It's a comfortable alternative to headphones where the sound won't bother other people.I haven't tested water resistance and I don't know why I'd want to. It'd be awkward to swim with.
4,It has good sound and forget I'm wearing it.  I no longer have to worry about disturbing the neighbors.
4,I have only used the set for a short time but the sound quality does seem pretty good.
5,I was looking for a solution to allow me to listen to music or podcasts while I ride my bike.  The sound is pretty clear and loud enough for casual listening while not sounding overly loud to others around me.
4,Sounds good.  Audio seems to come from behind my head though.  Also vibrates with high bass music.Lasted for my full 8 hour shift at work!
4,Like the usability sound is good. Eq features would be good to have except that a very good product.
5,I'm not going to lie I thought it would be something you buy out the dollar general store but I was amazed how it looked how it felt and most of all how it sounds. The bass is amazing.
5,Works great but company will not respond to questions about this product. Sad because they make the best audio gear for the money on the market.
4,Like everything but the control switch. One switch for all functions. Hard to distinguish between functions.
5,I ride a recumbent trike and wanted to listen to music without covering my ears with headphones. These are perfect. Can hear what’s going on in the outside world and still listen to music!  Love it!
4,Great speakers I used them to go mnt. Bike
5,I have used your other products and they are amazing quality with a great price. I want to see more products from you like regular headphones and bluetooth speaker alarm clock. Thank you for making such quality products. 🙏
5,I rarely write reviews but this is a solid well priced piece of equipment.  Previously I spent 30$ on a cheaper speaker and it was piece of c****.  The extra 20$ was definitely worth it.
4,I purchased for wife she likes it but her neck is very small compared to the wearable speaker. It may do just fine I hope .
4,Very confortable and are very good for speech audio not so good for music but have an acceptable sound for music.
5,Bought a more expensive one for another family member and got this one for my daughter because its a little less expensive... its not as loud as the more expensive one but is awesome for the money.
5,A five second setup even for a 77 year old untechie like me. Love having my ears free to hear if I'm needed.
1,The main issue with these speakers (that another review has pointed out as well) is the limiter they have put in place to keep the audio from peaking. I listened to an acoustic song the first time I put these on and I could hear the limiter kicking in on what little bass response was in the song. It pushed the volume of everything down when the guitar would strum. Same thing with every other track I tested. It really kicked in listening to electronic music. The fit and finish of these were really nice but unfortunately the audio quality is very poor. I ended up returning.
5,This is very comfortable to wear and light weight/ the sound is great.. Battery life is also good . I would definitely recommend this speaker
4,I like to listen to TV when the family  is sleeping.
4,I just opened the box but it looks like good quality and is comfortable to wear
5,I was shocked when I got this. It is super comfortable. Easy to use and set up. The sound quality is really great also. I plan on wearing this all the time
5,I enjoy wearing these while skating. The sound quality is very good and I can still be aware of what’s going on around me. Battery hasn’t died on me yet. Holds up well against my sweating.
5,I am able to listen at a volume I like and not disturb coworkers like other speakers I can also hear people when they talk to me better than with headphones.
5,Very durable product with nice sound haven't tested the battery life yet the only problem was the directions you could not make them out on that black paper change that and will be better
5,Excelleant sound quality.  Light weight.  Have not had long enought to determine battery life.  Instructions were on black paper written in gold.  Could not read.  Downloaded instructions from web sight.  Very pleased with purchase
4,I ordered to use in my massage fave cradle. Just received it. No feedback as yet
5,Was way better than what was expected. Shared with numerous friends at work and they said they were going to check it out. Great sound and easy to conceal. Would definitely buy again!
5,I just want unboxed this now so I haven’t had any long term use yet but so far I’m very happy with my purchase.*Edit - I love these! I wear them all day for work and music. So much better than headphones.
5,working at the yard when walking or jogging. Just perfect and its so easy to connect with my smart phone.
5,Great sound.Bought it to use when ridding My bike while listening Spotify.  Sound was fine but boosted Quality buying a 3 USD Equalizer wich added gain and bass.This speaker is way better than any headphone
4,Awesome sound! Comfortable! Long play time! This far exceeded my expectations and I love it!
5,I really like the wearable speaker.  I have no complaints whatsoever.  The sound quality is good and I think it is a good product for the price.
1,Received a used product. Poor shape. Scratches and been used
5,My 73 yr old father who is hard of hearing loves this. He said he forgets it's even on.  Alleviates the need for the TV to be on high volume and my mother can hear the show quite well without wearing them.
5,Love it for bike rides or audio books around the flat. Not the best for phone calls (people say I'm in a tunnel) but who calls you anymore anyway?
4,So far so good  I like the design it works really well.
5,I absolutely love this. I forget that I have it on. The sound is so much more enjoyable so close to my ears without even touching my ears like headphones. I've already shown it off to people!
5,I use this every day when I take my dog for a walk.  The sound quality waterproof and ease of use makes it perfect for long walks. I would highly recommend this Bluetooth speaker.
5,Sound quality is good. Base is acceptable. Comfort is very good.
2,When headset was malfunctioning I reached out to Seller only to get 100 questions and wanting a photo. Very disappointing in the warranty coverage as this was purchased about 4 months ago.  Will never buy again.
5,The product is very convenient when I am working out shopping or cooking. The product is also useful when at work and needing to take important calls and both parties are able to hear each other clearly.
5,Way better than I expected - just wonderful! I'm thrilled someone makes a product this fantastic and then there's no need to lie about it! Bless you!
4,Best sound bat Its to big!!! Not for work.
4,Surprisingly impressed with sound quality
5,It's good comfortable on my neck and doesn't weight much. I like the sound quality too although it's not the best but it's great for such a product. Will recommend.
4,Works well sounds good feels comfortable on the neck/shoulder
5,This wearable speaker is very comfortable not too heavy and sounds much better than other products in its competitive price range
5,I’m impressed with the quality and how comfortable it feels. Can’t wait to use it at work and while working in the yard!
5,I love the sound since I listen to a lot of Hip Hop and House music.  It's light and flexible and I can wear it around my neck for a long time.
5,I find Bugani products to be very well made and of high quality.
5,So far I like it.  Even using it on my meetings for about 6 hours a day for the past week
5,I absolutely love it. It sounds great where ever you go. You always have great quality sound around you at all time
5,Flexible Light.  and sounds AMAZING!  Add the sd card option and this is perfect for home telework and just around the house and yard.
5,Love this soundwear from Bugani. I  Use it to listen to listen to redit while I clean or work. LOVE THEM!
5,I love my wearable speakers. They are light weight and have great sound. I love that the sound isn’t going directly into your ears.
5,Buttons need to be a different color than black so as to stand out to see better. Other than that is a great unit and the quality is excellent
5,This thing is awesome the experience is like nothing else gives you the ability to hear the ambient noise around you still rock out with yoursock out
4,Here is a viewable manual
3,Ok product
5,Comfortable and sound quality is great with music and phone calls!
5,Very comfortable. Others can barely hear what is playing. Only nice thing would be a battery indicator as to charge left.
5,I've been using your product for about a week now. The design is incredibly comfortable and the sound produced is phenomenal.
5,I love this product this product is phenomenal. This is my first wearable sound gear. Its light s weight and the bass is thru the roof as well as the clarity if sound.
5,I haven't tried it when it was raining out or in water didn't realize it was water proof
5,Very comfortable around the neck versatile more convenient answering phone calls conference calls and comfortable
5,The only improvement would be the User Manual is a black background with gold printing which makes it very hard to read.  I use it for playing music while walking my dog.
5,Chose this for the wearability design and to listen to music without earbuds. It has quality sound with good bass in stereo.  Used it while riding my bike or walking.
5,Perfect for cruising on my one wheel. Great sound nice to still be able to hear what happening around me while still enjoying music.
5,Ergonomic stylish vs headsets can walk around during calls with better sound than pods.Music and movies sound awesome.

5,Design battery life easy to carry on and it's so light

5,It is a great product and I use it everyday at work

5,Great for listening to music while walking the dogs! Hate ear plugs as they block out too much noise! Not to heavy and they sound great! Love this!
5,Hands down the best shoulder speaker on the market. Compared to Bose and JLB which I already own. This was a more affordable and best so far!
5,Comfortable to wear I'm able to hear other sounds around me audibly apt headphones tend to hurt my ears. Great product for the price. Build quality excellent nice packaging.
5,It's amazing !! The sound is impeccable and the design is flawless  I don't like things touching my colar bone so perfect fit .
5,The sound quality is awesome. The comfort of the neckband. I love the convenience of hands-free.
5,The product looks great but the instruction manual is very hard to read.
5,The parents now aren’t blasting the television for the entire neighborhood to hear! Very comfortable and great price
5,I bought one for my daughter for Christmas and after listening to it I decided to get one for me!
5,Myself and my wife were both impressed by the sound quality. This product is very comfortable to wear even when seated and reclining back.
1,Worked GREAT for 6 months.  Charge port stopped working. Reported to Bugani they said "no problem we'll ship a new one".  That was 3 months ago.  When I remind them they say they are waiting for it to come in stock (Amazon shows them available to buy).Got tired of waiting and using my "over the ears" model so I bought this to replace it (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08BKZTZNT/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). I'll never order from Bugani again.

2,This worked pretty good for  my husband.  I could hear it too and it was just a  bit off time-wise.  Kind of annoying for me.  It wasn't very long until it started have times of static so we returned it.  He already had a chair speaker in another room that he liked so we purchased another one of those.

5,So far I am very impressed
5,Awesome
2,Unfortunately these do not work with PS4.  And I'm not sure why someone would use it in place of ear buds or a blue tooth speaker.
1,First the user guide is unreadable. Orange type on black paper. Second the sound coming from the speakers around my neck is loud enough for my wife to hear everything happening on the TV even turned down so I can just hear it which defeats its purpose. Maybe it works well if you use it when exercising but not for watching TV with someone else in the room. And that's assuming you can figure out how it works without a readable manual.
4,The Monster Boomerang neckband Bluetooth speakers are decent. I've been using the Panasonic Soundslayer for some time now but the fact that it's always tethered has left me wanting a wireless option. Enter the Monster Boomerang. The Bluetooth function on this thing is fantastic I have minimal to no latency when watching videos or movies and it finally frees me from that terrible USB cord. With that said the Panasonic Soundslayer does sound a little better; it's a little crisper with a better range and overall sound studio. But at over double the price I wouldn't say it's necessarily worth it. The Soundslayer is $200 as of the time of this review and the Monster Boomerang is $90 with two promotions that drop it down to $44 pre-tax. If the promotion is still on quit reading and just buy it.So Monster Boomerang. Good mid tones decent uppers poor bass (overall) but within expectations with how small these speakers are. There is some bass just not a lot. On the bass there are other reviews from the end of April 2022 talking about how the software limiter cuts down on heavy bass sections and in turn cuts the overall volume and ruins the listening experience for music. As of 5/18/22 I did not notice this. The volume for the mids and uppers remained consistent while the bass just underperformed. Monster may have fixed this issue. I've also come across others mentioning things like the "gold" and "silver" edition and that there was a difference then others quoting their replies from Monster saying there weren't any differences. Whatever it may be mine has the silver decals. The only gold decal version I know of is the Monster Boomerang Petite which is a smaller version of this Monster Boomerang. I also ran surround sound testing and the Monster Boomerang performed admirably. The sound is clearly coming from different locations between center right front right right back back left back left center and left front.The Boomerang feels heavy in the hands out of the box and it's got a little heft but it feels much better once you put it on your neck. It's a little like a gravity blanket where you feel it but it doesn't feel uncomfortable. Everything is on the right side: the controls and the charging port. The controls are raised button decals that feel nearly smooth in line with the headset body but there's a clicking sound each time you press it. Pairing with my computer was easy. In pressing the up/down volume buttons it likes to go in intervals of 6 for some reason and I haven't found a way around this yet. The silicone band between the speaker arms is thick and feels like quality. It can feel a little rough at first but I quickly got used to it and don't even notice it anymore.Overall the Monster Boomerang is an OK personal bluetooth speaker. It's great for watching videos TV shows and movies and is decent for music depending on how bass-dependent it may be. Given its size and limitations it performs quite well and at this price point even better. Again currently $90 retail with two promotions dropping it down to $44 pre-tax. If you see this thing below $60 I wouldn't hesitate to jump on it.
1,The box I received looked like it had been opened before. I tried charging it up for 12 hours with the included cable but nothing. I tried using a cable I knew worked but still nothing. No indicator light and h no ever got it to turn on. Returned.
5,I bought this product because after many hours a day working at home with a pair of headphone on I am beginning to suffer from ear infections. I thought this would give my ears a much needed break and it sure does.As for the product itself reproduction of speech is mediocre but base is solid and strong; so much fun watching movies with big explosion scenes with this. Bluetooth pairing is easy and the range is good rarely did I get dropped signal when I wonder off to the next room with it. Unlike another cheaper neck speaker (Bluedio) I have tried the body of this device is flexible and very comfortable to wear even over extended period. And if you keep the volume relative low while using it other people in the room will not notice you are listening with this device.However there are three flaws that really bothers me and hope Monster will correct them for next-gen.1. Improve sound quality but preserve that awesome base.2. Battery life can be better it's nowhere close to the 12hr claimed. Wish it can last at least 18-24hr.3. The most annoying attribute of this product: Access to the USB-C charging port can be easier. It is covered with a TPE plug for ingress-protection that requires the use of a screwdriver to pry it out before I can charge it. Please redesign with an IP-rated USB-C connector and get rid of the plug.Overall very happy with this product and will not hesitate to recommend.
5,This Monster Boomerang Neckband Bluetooth Speaker measures 10.28" x 8.66" x 1.93" and weighs a shade under a pound and a half. This Monster Boomerang Neckband Bluetooth Speaker is a bit weighty due to housing dual 3-watt speakers and 2 bass diaphragms that create a rich and immersive listening experience. There's also a built-in mic that can be used for calls. This Monster Boomerang Neckband Bluetooth Speaker uses Bluetooth 5.0 protocol and has an IPX7 rating for dust and water resistance.I used this Monster Boomerang Neckband Bluetooth Speaker for 2 months. I found myself this speaker was best used inside the house particularly during my work day when I want to listen to music while I typed documents or emails but didn't want to be tethered to a headset that would warm my ears.What I liked most about this Monster Boomerang Neckband Bluetooth Speaker was:- Fantastic sound. I have 3 of these neckband speakers and this Monster Boomerang Neckband Bluetooth Speaker is by far the best sounding of them all.- Very good battery life. At 30% volume I can get a full 8-hour shift of music playback with some battery left to spare.- Comfortable. Though this Monster Boomerang Neckband Bluetooth Speaker weighs about a pound and a half it's so well balanced it doesn't feel heavy at all.What I liked least about this Monster Boomerang Neckband Bluetooth Speaker was:- Mic and mic experience. Monster made some compromises in the mic sound and experience. Calls sounded a bit tinny and as far as I could tell there were no on-neckband controls for answering calls or muting the mic.Overall if you're looking for an entertaining experience with a neckband-style Bluetooth speaker then this Monster Boomerang Neckband Bluetooth Speaker should be on your shortlist. While there are so very price options with tons more bells and whistles this Monster Boomerang Neckband Bluetooth Speaker is designed to sound great with compromises in other areas. One of the key compromises was to the mic experience. I did not find the mic experience on this speaker to offer enough quality or convenience to be useful for my workflow. That said it can work in a pinch for very short calls. At the time of this review this Monster Boomerang Neckband Bluetooth Speaker can be had for less than 56 bucks. At that price this speaker is an absolute steal and I can highly recommend it to anyone who wants a good long-lasting listening experience from their neckband-style Bluetooth speaker. 4.5 out of 5.0.
4,Workout and chilling
4,But the volume control is so unnecessary when you're in the groove at work and the volume keeps shifting up and down. It doesn't slip from neck like my other neck speakers did. And it has the USB-C which is great cuz micro USB are just trash.
4,I love neck speakers. They leave me hands free to listen to my audio books while washing dishes taking a shower/bath walking my dog etc. This neck speaker is very water resistant. I have tested it in the shower/bath (not submerged just splashed) & while walking my dog in the rain- with no issues. It comes with a USB C to A cord but will also charge with a USB C to C connection. It connects quickly to my Samsung S10.The Bluetooth connection is great with a nice range. I have also used this for calls with no issues except sometime wind gets in the way for the receiver & I live in a windy area. The neck speaker can turn a bit on your neck but I've never had it completely fall off during use.The most annoying thing about this & the reason I docked it 1 star is that every time after I first connect it I go to raise the volume. Instead of raising the neck speaker's volume it always raises my phone's volume then eventually raises the neck speaker's volume. This only happens the 1st time but it definitely annoys me. The other brand of neck speaker I own doesn't have this issue & neither do my other Bluetooth devices- just this 1.When listening to audio books I almost always have this at max volume. My hearing isn't the best in 1 ear then add allergies & max volume works perfectly for me to hear every word perfectly crisp even outside in the rain (heavy traffic can still drown it out). I find that this speaker lasts a long time the first 80% but dies quickly the last 20%- just FYI.Overall highly recommended! Put the price & features against the competitors this is probably the best on the market.
5,Bought this after my Bose soundwear stopped charging. The USB C is definitely an upgrade. The the sound is just as good as my old $300 Bose in my opinion. I use it mostly for working outside and sleeping and it can get pretty loud if you need.The only downsides I've seen is the battery is a little on the small side compared to the soundwear and you can't skip with a button press.To pause the music you press the multi-function button once but if you double press it opens Google assistant. I wish I had a way to edit the controls or just skip songs on double press.I've used it almost daily for the last few months and it's definitely been worth the money.
4,The sound quality was very good. It just seemed to disrupt others at higher volumes. The battery life was amazing lasted all day. It's a great product I just don't have a lot of use for something like this. It's a very well made product with great value for the cost.
5,So I love these "bone fone" style headphones. I use them as a part of a costume to go to pinball tournaments where I purposefully wear outrageous clothing (light-up shoes and glasses jeans a leather jacket and of course these headphones). They're a lot of fun.On a serious note the sound quality is good for the price and outside of a costume I find them quite useful for doing yard work chores going on walks or anything where I need to be able to hear my surroundings.Overall I am pleased with them.
4,It's a unique change/experience from the typical headphones but one major annoying issue for me is that you literally feel the vibration on your neck/shoulders from the bass. That's not comfortable for me.But you can just use these as regular speakers as well.Another advantage is that you can hang these on a hanger or other places as well where most speakers wouldn't be able to.They do sound good - what you'd expect from this brand.
5,Greatest thing since sliced bread! I use these in a warehouse and they are awesome!
5,When I'm in the bedroom watching tv my wife does not hear it when she is reading in the next room.I'm in my later years and the tv is turned up when I listen to it this is perfect for private listening. Just be sure your tv is equipped with Bluetooth.Love it!
1,Could not hear it.
4,Where I live it's been sweltering. Fortunately Monster Boomerang gets things done. By that I mean that you get used to it. Once you get there that that is when things get very everything is really fine!
1,It was very good until it died a week later
5,So when I first saw this product I wondered...why would this exist when there are about a zillion types of over the head headphones earbuds etc and so on. And for music my go-tos are always either my Airpods Pro or Airpods Pro Max both which are excellent. However there are a couple of times when they are not ideal one of which is when you need to be very aware of what is going on around you...difficult to do when sound is RIGHT in or over your ears. Another is when you are on a call and need to remove the Airpod or the cup of the headphone from your ear for whatever reason (like itchy ears LOL) and you end up dumping the call accidentally.And THERE'S where this product comes in and really makes a lot of sense.I tested this first with a phone call that I knew would last over an hour - I called one of my lifelong best friends. Audio was clear...no issues hearing me whatsoever...and it was nice to not have an Airpod in my ear for that hour.Then I tested sound quality for music. I selected two songs which are generally what I use to test out new headphones etc for the last few years: The Weeknd's "Starboy" because of the undulation of bass it uses which contrasts nicely with the rest of the track and the vocals and then The White Stripes' "Seven Nation Army" for the deep bass lines which is consistently in the background. This set performed very well on both...in fact for both I had to turn the volume down when the songs began because it startled me to feel them both on my collar LOL. Overall the sound quality was very good and I was pleased with everything about it.Monster tends to make pretty good audio products and has for years...and this one is definitely no exception. To be clear I still love my Airpods products and will use those as my primary ways to listen to music and make calls. But this is definitely now going to be one of my go-to products as well as it does have great sound and I love the flexibility of it. Highly recommend if you are in the market for a different kind of way to listen to music or make calls!
5,I've tested several neckband headphones including the Panasonic SoundSlayer and Sony's SRS NB-10 both of which are significantly more expensive than Monster's offering but for a product that's still a bit of a novelty I think the cheapest version is actually very attractive. Even possibly preferable to the pricier options.OK first I'll mention the only real bad point. There's a slight distortion at low volumes related to the bass. It's only noticeable during drum beats where the volume of everything but the drum will be subdued for the duration of the beat. It doesn't happen for every song and the issue vanishes when the volume climbs above around 40% but I've heard it in once or twice and it's a little distracting though certainly not a dealbreaker.Other than that slight issue this is a very impressive piece of kit especially considering the sub-$100 price tag. It's so comfortable and lightweight that I forget I'm wearing it just a minute or so after draping it over my neck. The bass is powerful and the sound quality across the board is quite a lot better than I'd expect at this price.I've not run the battery down yet but another reviewer claims a 6 hour battery life. In a perfect world I'd be hoping for at least 10 hours between charges considering the size of this kind of speaker (i.e. there's no need to skimp on the battery) but it's not a huge deal. 6 hours is just about enough.I wouldn't usually offer 5 stars to a product that wasn't near perfect but I think the quality to price ratio here is very impressive. It's deserving of all 5 stars. I'd recommend this speaker enthusiastically.
1,Sound quality drops during call and hence I reduced my ratings from 5 to 1. I might send it back
5,I bought this because I have a vintage Alfa Romeo and her stereo is not very good. I have been really hesitant to pull the stereo out and replace it with something else because it is the stereo that is original to the car. This being said I am one of those people who has to have music while I’m driving. I know a lot of people use earbuds but those are illegal to wear when driving. I also don’t want to put a larger boom box sort of thing in my car because they just invite somebody to break in and steal the device.Monster neckband speakers are the perfect solution for me. They sound great I can get good volume of music and also great sound quality. The sound quality is good enough that I am perfectly happy with it even when the top on my car is down.  When I am not in the car I can slide it neatly under my seat where nobody can see so nothings in jeopardy of being stolen.As I mentioned earlier the sound quality is really good exactly what you would expect from monster brand. The battery life is great and overall I have no complaints whatsoever about this product.
5,I laughed when neckband speakers first hit the market but still ended up getting an inexpensive one to try out. It blew me away. I love headphones but the open sound stage you hear when listening to music with external speakers is so much better. A neckband speaker is like sitting between two floor speakers right in the "sweet spot." My first neckband speaker was great but needed some bass.These Monsters have amazing bass and amazing volume. I used my preexisting Spotify EQ setting and these blew me away with the bass response. It provides some great bass kick but not at the expense of the mid and high ranges. Obviously you can do your own EQ tweaking to match your own preferences.I am not an audiophile but to me the music quality is outstanding. The sound is external so I wouldn't use them anyplace where I do not want to disturb others but for private listening I prefer these over headphones for the great soundstage and bass. They are not cheap but are still less than high-end Bluetooth headphones.
5,So don't expect heavy bass as there is no way this little thing can do that but the sound is pretty good.You can feel the sound coming from different places and it is very accurate and crisp.One thing I liked is that I don't feel that I am wearing it which was my main concern I thought it will be heavier and that I will be feeling it but no it is very light and comfortable.It paired very quick and it even worked with my TV so I was able to hear everything connected to the TV through here (Bluray player Xbox etc)Basically is surround sound on your neck.
5,I've tried a range of these neck worn speakers.  I like them for late night TV watching.  People around you do hear the sounds but only if they are close.  Sound quality is quite good.  These are light weight.  Easy to use and  don't cause too much sweat on the neck.
1,Only one speaker works.
5,I got this for my husband to use with his VR Headset.It arrives with no charge and it took about 1.5 hours to charge it to full.It comes with very tiny print and hard to read directions.They are thorough however.It seems to be made well.It feel durable and sturdy.My husband tried this out by pairing it with his VR Headset.He was able to pair it easily with no extra effort.The sound quality was great.It can be turned up very loud with no distortion.The bass is solid.You can feel it playing.The treble was clear and not tinny.The button functions are easy to reach and use even while it is in use.He said there was a little bit of a learning curve on using the buttons and found it much easier to use the opposite hand to use them.The neck piece is very flexible.We would buy this again.
3,The battery life is...ugh. I got these for my mother's borthday - she likes to stream video in her loft but she cranks the speakers to an almost deafening level due to her hearing issues.I saw these and said "Why not?"She was quite happy with them at first the sound quality is decent (which made the house a good deal quieter) but after a few hours...dead.I figured that I hadn't charged them long enough so I left them plugged in for a night.Tried it again the next day; same results.Rather disappointing overall.They look good feel comfortable and sound good but I can't recommend these.
5,The other one is fine but the way it is made it is heavier the neck section is like a thick rubber band so the speakers can sort of move around as I do and that bothers me.  I like these because the speakers themselves are closer to my ears.  I also have some bone conduction headphones which after a time bother my ears so having this neck speaker set is perfect.  I can turn the music down so it's not blasting to nearby neighbors when out in my yard.  I have a zero-gravity chair and cantilever umbrella that is a wonderful place to hang out on hot days after doing some work in the yard.  I also will pull up an audio book to listen to - I have 3 new ones to listen to at the moment - so listening to my books through this neck speaker is convenient.  These are comfortable and easy to wear with good sound from the speakers.
3,I ordered this neck speaker expecting the manufacturer to have removed the sound limiter that has annoyed many customers. Unfortunately the sound limiter persists and there isn’t any mention of how to disable it in the user manual.In its current state its not completely useless: Its still a good hands free device for listening to non musical podcasts news etc as well as for doing phone calls. Battery life is decent perhaps in part because the speaker limits sound.The sound limiter could even make sense in some situations where you don’t want big fluctuations in volume that might disturb other peopleIt is really unpleasant to listen to music on this thing. There is no way around this. So even though I like neck speakers for their ability to provide surround sound without the problems of earbuds I just cannot recommend this one for 99% of people who would prefer to enjoy music
5,This boomerang is definitely worth it. Listening to videos or music is great on here. Nice and clear. It's also good for phone calls. You hear the person clear and they hear you clear with no outside noise. The only minor complaint is music with heavy bass it struggles a bit but not much
5,Previously I had a cheaper generic-brand neckband speakers that I didn't like because the bass was too weak. These Monster-brand speakers are great in comparison. The music sounds crisp and rich and the volume is loud enough for me. Works great for watching videos and movies too. I see some other reviews complaining about the audio sounding over-processed but that has not been a problem for me. Maybe I'm just listening to different types of music.These speakers are somewhat bulky and other people can hear them from several feet away so these aren't good for wearing out in public. I only wear them at home; mostly sitting at my desk with no one else in the room. These speakers are heavier than headphones but I find them more comfortable to wear because they are resting on my shoulders instead of pinching my ears. Battery life is great and the USB-C recharging is fast.If you plan to use them every day $90 is a very reasonable price for what you get.
5,I loved this neckband! The sound feels as if it's in 4D. Pretty comfy amazing battery life and quite light weight. Used in shower as well worked like a charm. Would definitely recommend getting one!
5,This neck speaker is really good. I like the fact that it feels like massaging my neck while playing some music lol. Sound is very good.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I'm a bike commuter and I have to balance hearing cars and hearing something interesting.  If I'm in a hurry I'll put on some music with a beat.  If I'm wearing ear-buds I can't always hear cars.  That's dangerous.  I've taken to wearing just one ear bud.  Now that I have this neckbad I find it's so much better for music and sounds pretty amazing.  I do miss the sound-blocking bit of the ear buds when there's a fire truck or motorcycle next to me but that's part of the trade off for safety.The battery life is amazing.  I can't really tell when the battery is low but charge this once a week anyway.When biking the speaker will bang up and down on the clavicle when dropping off curbs and hitting massive pot holes.The buttons are easy to find.  I do wish the power button didn't take so long to engage.I don't know how waterproof this is but it does show sweat stains.  I've had it for a week and it's got some decent stains.  I don't know how to clean it but they don't show much.The voice is nice and pleasant and connections to Bluetooth are quick.
5,HELP I’m a mail carrier so this device has been great however it just stopped working for no reason. I loved it but it started not charging completely and then just stopped working at all.
2,The sound quality was ok if you turned the bass off/down. Otherwise it muddles the mids and highs. When I say battery is so-so I mean just that. If you keep the volume turned down to a dull roar you'll get 6-7 hours of battery life. If you're a loud jammer like I tend to be then you cut several hours off that. That's really weird that sound levels would affect battery life that much. Honestly I don't see how these neckband speakers ever caught on. Maybe I'm from a different planet or would better suited to living in the 1800's but I'm just not crazy about wearing these things especially in public. It's not uncomfortable just annoying. And it looks really geeky wearing it around. Personally I'd rather just wear earbuds or just listen to my computer speakers in my office. But hey each to their own I say!
4,Sound is excellent. Able to conduct calls easily .
5,Compared to a couple other brands/models I've tried this wearable sits much more securely around my neck - I even wear it when bicycling which I would not dare do with either of the other units I've tried.  The sound quality is also very very good and the batteries last a good long while (used through an 11-hour shift accidentally left on [but not in use] overnight then used through an 8-hour shift the next day before I started getting Low Battery warnings).
5,My older car stereo does not have Bluetooth connectability. I was not comfortable about using earbuds to listen to music from my phone for fear of not being able to hear what was going on around me while driving. This wearable speaker is just what I needed! (In case like I initially wondered how you put this around your neck it's made of semi-ridged silicone... I just kinda stretch/spread it open and slip it around my size 18 neck). Sound quality is very good and I can even feel the bass range vibrating against my collarbones. Something tells me that when privacy is not a consideration that my earbuds have been relegated to secondary use. At least here from the start I am VERY pleased with my purchase!! Thanks for a seemingly great product.
5,It is very convenient. Easy to use and comfortable to wear.
4,Liked it a lot got it as a gift and I would honestly buy one now if mine broke or went missing
5,I had a lot of trouble with a brand I saw for the first time. But after reading many reviews I chose it and the results were great. I can enjoy riding. You will be even happier if you purchase when they have regular discounts. There is no problem with the battery at all for 1 hour now. But of course you shouldn't compare the sound quality with big companies like Boss. :) (but overall very satisfied)
4,Use to listen to audio books while walking.
4,I did get this on a great deal so was willing to risk the buy and was surprised and how good it is for the money I spent (got it for less then $25) . I'm very happy with it. I was mostly looking for something I could use my my desktop PC that would allow me to hear videos & music but still hear what was going on around me. The only downside for me (which may be a plus for others) is the heavy bass on this. I'm over 50 and the bass level on it kind of hurts my ears. Needed to adjust the EQ setting for my music and turn the bass down. Other then that I'm very happy with this purchase and have switch away from my headphone to this wearable speaker.  Only thing I would like would be some way to tell on the PC what the battery level was at.
5,Fantastic idea perfect for listening to podcasts or music while I'm working around the yard.  I got tired of headphones as they're all uncomfortable after a while and they impare my hearing.  It's also annoying to take off my headphones every time someone passes by and says 'hi' as I don't want to be rude.  This speaker allows me to carry a short conversation just fine and it makes me look a lot more approachable to my neighbors and family. If I walk around with  headphones most people tend to avoid bothering me.For a while I switched to a small speaker that I was carrying around in my tool belt however I had to crank it much too loud for my liking in order to hear podcasts properly.  This is truly the perfect solution.The audio experience is truly awesome much better than expected I find myself using it for Netflix all the time.  The speaker works flawlessly  have not had any issues with it at all.One caveat:  I've had it fall of my neck several times when bending over to pick up something.  I wish there was an option to connect the two open ends via a lanyard just for those situations. Should this drop in mud or off the ladder  it would be the end of it. Now that I mentioned it I really need to tie something between the ends.I realize my review is so positive it sounds too good to be true but this truly fits my needs perfectly.
4,This thing puts out great sound for the price I paid excellent bass. But those black buttons blend into the speaker and are almost impossible to see them in a dark room.
4,The design looks premium and it’s not heavy to wear it. Sound is good. It has 4 speakers but not sure if all 4 works always. I can hear only sound coming from 2 big speakers and not from 2 small ones.
4,Good to wear. Sound quality is not very good but i understand since it has light weight.
5,I thought I found the perfect headphones for watching movies taking calls. I used them a lot a mean a lot for everything I really liked the sound and the quality. So when they broke after 3 months I was little upset and posted a message to the seller wasn't expecting a response since it was more than 3 months since my purchase but to my surprise they sent me a new headset all I can say is awesome product backed by amazing customer service.
4,I really love the look and the performance of these headphones but the initial set-up was more troublesome than necessary because they printed the instructions in light gold type on black paper.  I literally had to use a flashlight to read them.  Putting the instructions on plain white paper in plain black type would have been better for the user and cheaper for the manufacturer.  But once I got past that initial annoyance these things are great.
4,impressive sound and ease of use. Use it daily as a wearable and also as a bluetooth speaker for my TV just lying on the table.
4,Good quality sound  and flexible construction without having i feel too heavy around your neck.
5,Comparable to more expensive units at a lower price and good sound
4,Great sound for the money. Very comfortable to wear.Would like for the control buttons to be easier to operate by feel.
5,It’s a very comfortable fit around the neck and the sound is great for the size it is
5,The sound is loud and clear. I love that the device doesn’t get in the way of me moving around doing housework. The sound quality is very good. I have already recommended this product to friends!
4,good and chep
3,My main purpose was for the car since I can't connect my phone to the car.The Good: Nice sound great range - I can walk around most of the house still connected a bit bulky but for the sound it's worth it.The bad: I believe I'm about 2-1/2 months in and I use them almost daily. But this week I noticed the sound related to media (YouTube IG etc) would stop or wouldn't even start. But phone calls were fine. Also the volume resets really loud for each phone call. I was willing to deal with that but no sound at all - what's the point. Unfortunately I'm outside of the return window.I sent a message to their support so hopefully this will be resolved. I got my dad a pair at the same time and he says he's had no problems so perhaps I got a dud.
5,I had been looking for a perfect work from home audio solution. I tried USB headsets bluetooth wireless sets Airpods Airpod Pros and many. None of them worked comfortable for me for full day 8 hour usage. My ears were straining with over the ear ones and blue tooth in ear solutions. I couldn't work with any of them for more than 1 hour and they were painful. Then I heard of Bose Soundwear and wanted to buy them. But the cost of $300 was too prohibitive for me for a solution which I'm not sure will work. Then I saw this deal on Amazon for $22 bucks and I caved in. I was completely taken back by how simple this solution is for work. The meetings were crystal clean and I never had any ear strain as this was on my neck and I didn't have to put anything in or over my ears. Only problem is it's a bit heavy. But I'm ok with this. They last all day and more. I found my perfect work from home audio companion.
4,The product would be better if it were totally water proof so it could be worn in the rain.
4,I like this because I can hear things that are around me as opposed to in-ear earbuds.
4,the device look great can't wait to use it
5,I use this all day while I’m working.
4,Good value for the price
5,Really like these speakers they are very good. The base is amazing when it’s close to your ears. With the volume all the way to high it’s like having a Bluetooth speaker in the home. Amazing item thank you.
4,The bass sound is strong. The design is elegant and the composition of the box is very organized.
2,This “should be”a great neckband bluetooth speaker that is absolutely ruined by some wonky digital processing that limits the volume and ruins songs every time.Let me start with the good:At an advertised price of $90 I’d say that is ultimately a bit high but right now there’s an Amazon coupon for $15 off and that seems reasonable. The neckband comes in a nice box an no frills. You get the speaker a USB-A to USB-C charging cable and instructions. The neckband is very comfortable to wear and once you start listening to it you’ll forget that you have it on. It’s light and the shape makes it very unobtrusive. The four speakers “should be” quite good for the size of the package overall and on deeper bass notes you can feel a little bit of vibrations on your neck. The speakers are angled as such that they deliver the music right to your ears without having to crank the volume up too loud which is nice.Now for the bad:There is some digital volume limiter that kicks in when the bass notes drop “too low”. It absolutely 100% ruins the music every time. I’m not even talking music that has a ton of bass and I have the volume cranked to the limits. Just normal bass drums or bass guitar on an average pop or rock song at a normal volume! As soon as bass comes in you can hear the volume limiter kick in and lower the volume and then it tries to raise the volume back up when the bass is “over” but it’s never over because IT’S A SONG! So the whole time you’re listening to the music the volume just goes up and down and ruins anything you’re trying to listen to. The moment the speaker was fully charged I connected it to my iPhone and chose the first thing in my alphabetical playlist: Adel and her newest album 30. This is Adel. Vocal driven music Adel. Not drum-n-bass Adel. Almost immediately in the first song I noticed it and thought it was my phone or something but it kept happening. My wife from across the room exclaimed “why does it sound like that?! What is it doing?!” I went into my iPhone settings and thought maybe I have some preamp sound setting like “pop” or “extra bass” or something but no such thing was set; it was set to “off”. In fact the only way I could even remotely mitigate this horrible sound processing was to switch the iPhone setting “on” that limits the volume. Of course this is sort of doing the same thing but directing the noise processing to the phone and not the speakers. This had a noticeable affect to the good but not only could it not stop the speakers from still clipping the volume it lowered my music volume to a limit I didn’t want! Ugh! Trust me this is worth returning the neck speaker right now.I also didn’t like the very limited range the Bluetooth has. I had my phone in the living room and got up off the couch to go to the kitchen with is about 15’ away in a semi-straight line only separated by line of sight by a slight hallway threshold and the connection started clipping. I have worn this speaker on my neck and had my phone in my back pocket and had the Bluetooth connection start clipping as well! Are my bones THAT dense?!I also can’t stand the buttons. They are small and located on the right side of the device. You get an up and down a power and an action button all on the side. The issue is you must memorize the order of the buttons and I can NEVER remember which button is volume up and which is volume down. There is zero differentiation between the buttons. It isn’t as though the the up button is thick and chunky and the down is thin and not as protruding. They could have made a chunky solid triangle for one volume button and a thin hollow triangle for the other. Nope. Nothing of the sort. I’m forever fumbling for where the buttons are located and then once I find them I click on the first one my thumb finds and it is inevitably not the button I want.Here is the ONLY saving grace for me and why I won’t be returning these. I don’t listen to music through headphones very much. I primarily listen to audiobooks and podcasts through headphones almost exclusively. If I want to listen to music I have a dedicated music set up in a room in the house with quite a bit of time care and money spent on making music sound phenomenal through the speakers at a room shaking volume. But for headphones it’s basically spoken word for me. With that in mind this speaker is actually perfect for me to listen to books and podcasts as I go about my day cleaning the house doing dishes working in the garage or just relaxing in the back yard. It’s nice because I can hear my book or podcast and still hear ambient noises for safety.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in making a decision. This is the first pair of neckband speakers I’ve owned so I unfortunately can’t compare it to any other brands or tell you that this sound processing thing isn’t endemic to all neckband speakers. However based on my personal usage and the reviews of others here if you want these to listen to music just buy a decent pair of over the ear headphones with noise cancelling (the Sony 1000XM3 is a fabulous option and one that I own!) If you’re anything like me and will just casually wear these around the house and listen exclusively to audiobooks and podcasts then these are actually a great buy!
4,Prefer this over the Oraolo.  More bass and lighter.  However buttons are too close to each other especially the power button.  Overall sound quality is better than the Oraolo.  Would recommend for sure.
5,I absolutely love these speakers. The surround sound is amazing and the fact that I can actually FEEL the bass when playing music is AWESOME!
4,Great Sound. Amazing Value! The bang for your buck on this product is bar none! 80 percent of the sound quality of Bose but at a fifth of the price.
5,This speaker is perfect! Not only can I use it for my phone calls but the sound is amazing. For some one like me who can’t ever wear ear buds because I have small ears this is perfect!! Bought another pair for my husband because they are that great!
3,I bought it at a promotional price of $25. It is an ok speaker at the price. However the user manual is unreadable with gold letters printed on black paper. I also can't find the manual for download on the web. There is a lot the brand can do to improve on quality. In my opinion there are better products at its regular price point.
5,Works great and connects easily enough and quickly. Also very comfortable around neck
5,Very comfortable to wear. Volume is nice.
4,Good so far but only had it 1 day. Hope it lasts
3,Loved the bass quality however the speaker blew and started cracklings 3 months into them.  I wore them at work so did have volumn  up on highest 80% of time but never got wet  Battery was good quality. Lasted 16 hours before having to recharge.
4,Good audio quality for the price
4,Brought this so I can listen to music while I’m riding my bike 🚲 outdoors. So far so good.
3,Nice niche product! I have too many headphones earbuds speakers etc though this is great for the situation! good value - It's comfortable music is plenty while allowing for awareness of the surroundings. When I talk through the microphone via bluetooth cellphone some have said that the start of s-sound words are clipped out.
4,It’s looking so nice so far . I like the idea of not putting stress on ur ears
4,These work well but the box says Water resistant not waterproof. Do I believe Seller or Manufacturer?
5,I have been using your brand name before so I bought it. The Battery last for about 8 - 10 hrs .Nice design and sound is very loud and good.
5,Very comfortable and light weight.
5,Really surprised at the clarity and deep bass. Very satisfied with this purchase. Would definitely recommend.
5,I just got it but so far I like it. This was a gift.
4,Great product for those of us who hate headphones/earphones.
5,Play time is excellent and sound quality
4,Great product. That’s exactly what I need.
5,Sound is very good and as important to me so comfortable to wear. Great for power walking or bicycle riding.
5,My boyfriend got me these so the neighbor would stop complaining!
5,I love this thing.  Bought for biking walking dogs and skiing as I don't want anything in my ears for safety.  Sound is impressive for what it is.  I plan to buy another for my wife.  Only improvement I would make would be a way to connect the open ends for more rigorous activity maybe a little leash system or clasp.  Otherwise great!
5,It has a slim profile and connects to my phone without any issues. I like the sound quality and it has amazing battery life.
5,Great sound. Great design. Perfect for all my Zoom and Teams meetings.
5,This is the best Bluetooth speaker I've purchased in a long time.
5,Sound is fantastic
5,great value great sound battery life is great as well! I bought this wearable speaker to use in my old school Saturn so I could listen to my music via Bluetooth from my online music service . Easy to wear not distracting at all while driving comfortable & handsfree  conversations  if you choose. I will use it around the house & yard  maybe while walking. I like it !!
2,I am returning it as several things didn't work for me.  Detail below.What I liked:1. Good sound quality if listening to music. Felt like surround sound.2. Pairing was easy3. Charging was quickMust improve:1. Volume resets for every call and every time it is connected.  It is really loud and need to reduce the volume using the controls on the unit.2. Phone bluetooth volume control has No control on the volume.  Don't think it is Bluetooth 5.0 specification.3.  When using the mic there is echo now and then unpredictable.4.  Had several disconnects during a 30 minute call.Wanted to like but too many bugs to live with. Nice try but will need to wait for a more refined version.  Could have been good value for money if it worked properly.  Don't recommend at this time.Thanks and hope this was helpful.
5,The product turned out to be beyond what I expected it to be !Very well packaged and it was easy to turn it on and connect with sources with a clickIt is very lightweight and so far sound quality is ok I wont call it exceptionalLook forward to use it more and then can give more insights !
5,Great sound easy to connect to phone and very light weight 🥰.  I highly recommend .

5,i love that it does not sit on my neck.  It has great sound and loud enough
5,It was a gift. Took me right out of my depression.  Love it! Lots of bass sound quality is amazing.  Fantastic value for the money. We are going to buy several more as gifts.
5,I am using this as my headset while working from home. The style is so much more comfortable than the traditional headsets and the quality is great! The only thing that would make it better is a mute button on the device.
5,Product works great and has awesome sounds quality! Use it around my house while working.
5,Really like this for the usability functionality and price. The sound is great. I don't like over the ear headphones or ear buds so this item will come in extremely handy on long plane trips

5,So far so good.  I just got it bet looks like exactly what everyone said.  Hope its really waterproof

5,I love it sounds good. And fits good on my neck and very clear music and sounds good while on the phone
5,Excellent sounds and great design
5,I bought it for me but my son wanted it so I gave it to him. He uses the speaker everyday connected to his phone and PC.
5,Sounds very nice very comfortable to wear a little smaller may help but must retain the strong bass to make sense.
5,Sounds quality was very good. A lot louder then expected. Very nice product for the money

5,Sounds good fits
5,Personal use
5,Comfort
2,The sound volume is too low.
1,It was comfortable to wear and easier than wearing headphones however one of the speakers went bad after a month. I am outside of the return time so I’m out of luck.
1,Not what I expected and due to no instructions I can’t figure out how to turn it on after charging
1,Because the user manual is useless the wearable speaker is useless as well.
2,*update September 2 2022*As result of both speakers doing similar defective vocal cut out the seller offered to send me a different product to test or so I thought. This was a bluetooth speaker with handle that is made to carry to lake or similar.  It was not monster brand and I don't think the seller's intention was for me to review it.  At this point I think the seller sent me a different product to get me to remove my review.  The non-monster branded product which in in the sub $100 price range works better than the Monster speaker here.I'm not going to change/update this review going forward after receiving the last email.  I'm not going to give it additional stars due to a different product working correctly. I truly believe all of this specific model is defective at this point.  Someone more technical than I am explained in detail what I am experiencing in how electronic speakers work but deleted their review - so I'm assuming they received the other product and reacted to the email below (I've received this same sort of email multiple times from the seller at this point).From seller:  Dear  <my name>  Can the new equipment work?  Can you help me modify the positive review or delete the comment? <link to this review>  Good reviews are very important to meI will be very gratefulI reiterate - this product works well when it is worn with the loud engine of my waverunner in the background.  I don't notice the vocals cutting out - although they likely are and I just cant tell with all the competing noise.  But anything where there isn't background noise the vocals cut out at every thump of the base.  The original and the replacement speaker does it.  It happens with iphone connected and it happens with a laptop computer connected.  I do not believe Monster built in a way to update the drivers for the speaker so I do not think the speakers will ever work well for music.  The product does work well for a speaker phone and for audio calls.  I haven't had complaints from other users and it is nice not to have a headphone on my head.  I do not use that functionality because a bluetooth connection does not travel as far away from my laptop as I would need it to.If you do purchase this the seller will likely take actions to try to make things right but I do not believe that is going to be a speaker that works right.  There is the possibility I was unlucky and received 2 defective units but I really think others are playing music without lyrics or they aren't really listening to what the sound is doing.  I tend to read other reviews when I think I may have something defective and the reviewers that reported same problem did not update that the defect was resolved.  They just said seller fixed issue.  Well I have no idea what they responded to the sellers email requesting "What do I need to do to fix this error".  When I received "Is it ok to send new outdoor bluetooth speakers" I responded "I wish I knew how to correct the issue too.  You can send outdoor speakers if they are rechargeable. I don’t have convenient outlets outside. They would need to handle bass decently. "  Again I thought they wanted to get feedback from me.  But you can read and decide.*updated review in august 2022*The seller reached out to me about this review.  They offered to replace the device and I specifically asked to only replace if they felt I had a defective unit.  Well they sent me a replacement and it does the exact same thing.  Any sort of drum beat or bass thump in music causes the other frequencies to cut out.  I can still hear the lyrics clearly but it is noticeable they are going up and down in volume the entire song.I have started carrying this in my car to use as a speakerphone.  It fits in my center console easily but it not small by any means.  It does work well if you don't want something covering ears while driving.  This is probably the best use I've found for this speaker.  It works okay for listening to youtube also - anything with only speech involved.The only item I found where it works okay for music is for my waverunner.  I imagine it'd work okay with an atv also.  Anywhere there is plenty of background noise where a regular speaker gets drowned out.  Since there is so much noise competing the volume drop out isnt as noticeable.  Recognize I'm trying to find a use that this might work for not that I'd recommend this unit.  The only way I'd recommend this is to use for a speaker phone and no music playing.*Initial review*Pay attention to what other reviewers are using this device for.  People who are using this as a communication device seem to be pleased with it.  But I wanted to use it for music without having to wear earplugs or headphones and this is one of the worst performing devices I own for that.The issue is that when anything of bass is played over the speakers other sounds are all muted - and that is most noticeable for vocals.  The end effect is the vocals track going up and down in volume the entire song where the beat hits.  Don't underestimate how prominent this is from positive reviews.  You won't hear this if you are using this device as a speakerphone or if the music is mostly treble sounds.  Also it is not as noticeable with instrumentals with bass.  Music with vocals and bass is where these fail so there are some music tracks that sound ok.But if you are in the categories that don't cut out above the unit is comfortable to wear for long periods of time.  I wouldn't use this for anything that I get sweaty if it directly touches my neck.  I find that clammy feeling on my neck unpleasant but most activities indoors and out are fine.I could find no way to contact Monster on their site.  I did send a question to them to see if there is a fix but not response at this time.  Also I posted a question on the product but I have no resolution at this time.  This product looks and feels premium but the 'brains' of it feel like a protype or defective.  I see no way for the manufacturer to update the product firmware so I do not expect any fix to appear.I do NOT suggest these - there are better options.  I'm surprised Monster is risking their reputation by releasing this product in this state.  It changed my perception of them.
3,I bought both the M110 and the monster boomerang. These two models I compared extensively and found them to be pretty different. These are something I did not know I needed.. and I "love/hate but love a bit more" them.. The issue for someone like me is that they are good enough to awaken the audiophile and now I want to have one with all these issues ironed out. It would not have been any harder to make either of them a lot better ..which I find most frustrating.I am a critical glass half empty type. There is no saving me. I have accepted it. If you want to know pretty lies of sunshine in a Brawndo world to make you _feel_ nice move along to 9 out of 10 of all reviews. If you want to know what is WRONG with them in an ugly truth world .. read on=======monster =======Pros:- Sound- The bass I would not call it great but MUCH better than the m110 ..by far. It's not .even .close. You feel vibrations like you have a little boombox on your shoulders.  (this will be a pos factor if I choose to keep this one).- sound- people around you can hear this one a little easier but both are great at the sound being 10 times less at arms length.- smaller and Lighter around neck.. Perhaps too small for a thicker neck. makes it more secure for me. I work on all kinds of things and can find the m110 slipping off entirely in some positions. This is 3 times more secure. Both are comfortable but this one I really could just forget it is there and find myself in a grocery store with it and feel like a dweeb. Also it places itself in a pretty good sound position compared to the other one (this could be body dependent I imagine). You can pull it wider and get a better sound stage sacrificing volume.. but compared to the m110.. you need to do nothing.. it will always be in a good spot vs. the m110 I sometimes fidget with to get better listening. (this will be a pos factor if I choose to keep this one).- Latency very low. Impressive. (this would be a pos factor if I chose it)- volume works in normal increments which is only a thing at all because the m110 sucks at it.. Yay!- USB C- Both will work while charging which I appreciate.Cons:- sound- Mids and sound stage are weaker on the Monster sadly but not comparing them you may not miss them. Perhaps there is an equalizer app out there that does not suck.- sound- badbadbad. the sound is obviously run through some active software.. to an audiophile... just shoot me. Reduces the entire volume on hard hits. Ruins it... I started to get sort of used to it.. but it is like someone is playing with your volume knob.. and you need to slap the bastard immediately for some peace.... which you never get.. because you can't. Like I said I sort of got used to it. Most people probably won't even notice it.. but audiophiles.. this is going to bug. Going from a longer session where I got used to it.. to the M110...even though it is less rich.. I felt immediate relief.. because of this horrid thing some mouthbreather at Monster decided to do to it that added to the cost btw. If you could turn it off or down and mess with an equalizer.. this one would win no problem on sound... IF. (this will be a HUGE factor if I choose the 110 instead).- both have retarded buttons. Terrible. Stupid! WAY too shallow.. is this little bump the one? Am I going to have to strip this off my head (like everyone who tries them does) just to look? FFS. Gloves? hell no. both are so pathetic you have to gently ...slowly ...roll your naked finger ...up ...until you touch something delicate and small ..and coax it to your bidding.. what? Are you not entertained? XD Monsters buttons: "let us make it extra stupid" was the builders motto apparently.. so first your finger hits the led indicator which is almost as prominent as a button... so you finally learn to skip that one.. then volume UP.. because that is obviously the first thing you need in a hurry when someone is trying to talk to you...sigh.. then down.. then power (cause reasons). then play/pause. basically as stupid as you can possibly get. yay my life. I think on the monster the thing to do may be to come from the back instead if you have an interruption.. then at least you start with pause... Overall very frustrating.. and even after 3 days using it a lot.. still frustrating. little annoyances add up in life and should be rectified if possible.. IMO of course... Most of you all love to suffer it seems ..as I watch in absolute horror.. carry on then.- Charge LED exists.. but is not very bright (after all that). Please make it bright enough to see in a lit room (radical I know) and recess it 0.5mm and save a kitten. Will someone think of the Kittens!- Battery- Will rip through it in a few hours if you are really rocking out. Bass probably.- phone conversation was pretty bad on the monster for some reason I could not identify. Likely that asinine software (deciding factor).====M110====Pros:- Sound- much better mids and spacial sound stage than monster. I was very impressed with that. (deciding factor)- Sexy material all over. Any time you touch almost ANY area of it.. oooh nize. I even got one for an elderly VERY straight laced friend.. her comment was immediately. "Wow it's almost sensual"... I was a bit shocked honestly. Imagine Mary Poppins saying that... I was like.. We are ordering you one right now lol. Between that and hearing the TV better than ever. She loves it. Loves. If there was a fire.. she might go for it.- Sound. You can rock out and someone can barely hear it 5 feet away. If this bothers someone near you they are the type you can never satisfy. Leave them now JK lol ...probably.- It will absolutely fit any neck.. this also means it can be tweaked for a better sound position. Ideally for me if I was only interested in sound (and it certainly is #1 for me) I would have to glue some foam to the neck piece to pull it back.. and  foam under the main pods to lift them a bit.. that produces the best sound it can do. Too inconvenient or embarrassing to do that for most probably so you just live with it. The sound is not "bad" but If you are lounging with pillows you can position it nicer.- phone conversation was better than monsters.- battery life good enough I don't think about it.- black version uses USB-CCons:- Sound- Bass is weak terrible even though the speakers have double the real-estate compared to the Monster so how bad an engineer do you have to be to make that happen? Any sound enthusiast who has built a speaker could have done better with it. Disappointing. Many non audiophiles will not notice. (deciding factor)- Sound- badbadbad "sometimes" sounds like speakers are actually blown and the dude cannot abide. I can only assume that it is software since it is only sometimes. Any bass just sounds like that speaker is blown.. The mids still sound normal. Maybe it is when the battery is low.. I am not sure what triggers it.. maybe it is just my unit. but it is unbearable for an audiophile. (HUGE deciding factor)- more latency. If you are using it for video.. you might hate it. Some people can live with that some can't. I hate it. (deciding factor).- Volume adjustments are too large. Often you want it a hair lower or higher and it jumps 4 times that. (annoying enough to be a negative deciding factor for me).- Name. oreelo orea Areola no that can't be it ..ya know what OrEO? your name is stupid and I'm pissed you tried to make me get used to it. m110 from now on got it? (I got 3 people to buy this model after trying it and trying to tell them the name was downright embarrassing. You should pay me for pain and suffering.)-both have absolutely retarded buttons to get you in the mood for "slap an engineer day" (That's not a thing? Well it bloody well SHOULD be shouldn't it!). The buttons are WAY too shallow.. is this little bump the one or is it a casting flaw? Am I going to have to strip this off my head just to look? FFS. M110 at least has the power button in a different spot and that button is fine. On the m110 they make more sense at least and are a little larger. First one you hit is lower volume. then play/pause. then volume up. Sense....ish (but you notice it is still in the cons area)- Blue version uses Micro USB which should be taken out back and shot. Please stop making stuff with it.=================Conclusion: They are both great and I hate them!!! XD If I HAD to choose one. The M110 making me feel relief from the Monster reluctantly wins it for me... I guess. It could go either way really. But for an audiophile either will be some sick torture over time. In the end I actually decided I will ditch them both and modify a used JBL for more power or modify a used Bose (Better sound through marketing!) to undo that unholy thing they do with bass. That is beyond what most people will do and I wish I did not have to.. but I tinker a lot and these products re-awakened that guy who put away his vintage studio monitors because of a living situation so this is what happens. Thanks for reading my book.
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 UPDATE 2: I don't really know what happened but I'm running into the same problem on my computer as well. I'll just reiterate that I think as long as you're not listening too critically or listen to primarily compressed pop music where it's not an issue these are fine but it's just so annoying that the problem even exists!UPDATE: The audio processing that is applied that seems to alter the volume during playback is such a strange issue that I had to more tests. I found that strangely I don't experience the same audio processing problems using the Monster Boomerang with my computer. The same BT codec (SBC) is used for both my phone and computer and I've tested using various music playback apps. On the mobile side I experience the same problem (though to slightly different extents) on both two different Android phones (Pixel 5a and Pixel 3 running LineageOS) and my iPad -- this is the problem illustrated in the video. After testing with different environments and music my conclusion is that if you use it on the computer you won't hear the problem; if you listen to music that already has a compressed dynamic range (which is frankly a lot of music) you won't hear it and if you aren't listening critically (i.e. you're using it outdoors) you probably won't hear it. So given the form factor and intended usage I think it actually works pretty well.Now that I can properly evaluate the sound quality it's really quite good considering the form factor -- this isn't going to be able to compete with headphones or earbuds but if we compare it to other listening options that keep your ears open it sounds much better than bone conduction headphones. This has ample bass (you can actually feel it thumping on your collarbone) and clear highs and mids. This also gets quite loud considering how close they are to your ears -- I only need them up about half way while riding my scooter at 15 mph.These point up at your ears so it's much louder for you than it will be for people around you but they'll still be able to clearly hear your music. I'd say that it sounds roughly 50-100% louder for the person wearing it than others.Battery life is nowhere near the 30 hours in the promo materials it's been closer to 5-6 hours for me which is still very good.I tested on a call and nobody complained about my mic so it's OK.This doesn't support multipoint (that is you can't have 2 devices simultaneously connected) but it's pretty easy to repair. I didn't experience any BT connection issues in a few days of use. The volume controls have a weird slight lag that I haven't experienced with other headphones.My updated rating -- if you are using this with a device that doesn't result in the audio processing issue illustrated in the video with this review like if you use it only with your computer then I would give it a 5. It has really good sound quality in a comfortable package with decent battery life. If you want to use it with a mobile device and are either in a quiet environment or particular about audio quality this is basically a 1 or a 2 depending on the type of music you're listening to. For my use I give it a 4.ORIGINAL REVIEW: Do you wish your speakers would applying processing to your audio to make it sound worse? Or not even worse but varying levels of worse?! This "Monster Boomerange Neckband Bluetooth Speaker" is the speaker for you!So I have to start by addressing the audio processing because it sucks. I don't know if it's the "3D surround effect" or a feature to ensure the speaker drivers aren't overdriven but the end result is that music sounds like somebody is sitting there adjusting the volume whenever there is any bass. More specifically it sounds like the dynamic range is getting compressed and the mids and highs suffer more than the bass. Don't think that because you don't listen to hip hop or dubstep that it's not going to affect you -- I hear it on everything from Adele's "Set fire to the rain" Mr. Mister's "Broken Wings" to The Cranberries' "Zombie". I actually find it less noticeable on contemporary pop music though it's still there.It's actually a shame aside from the audio processing messing everything up the audio quality is pretty decent. It's a bit on the bass heavy side but it's pretty tight without getting too muddled given the limitations of the form factor. The mids and highs are a little harder to judge primarily due to the constant interference of the audio processing but it sounds like there's potential there. Adele's voice on "Someone Like You" (one of the few songs that doesn't have too much of the audio processing ruining it) is somewhat mid-forward with a slight lack of clarity at the high end. A good pair of earbuds or headphones will sound better but this sounds pretty good for what it is.I didn't notice any issue with the Bluetooth signal -- I got to about 25 ft inside my house between my phone and the neckband before running out of room. Note that this only supports the SBC audio codec and not higher quality ones like apt-X.The physical controls work well with a different tactile feel so you can tell which button you're pressing without looking.The neckband feels comfortable around my neck. The middle part that links the two sides is made of a flexible silicone so it's entirely rigid which I image helps it to sit a bit better. It has enough weight to it that I don't think you need to worry about it accidentally falling off. It also looks pretty good and feels like it's made of good quality materials.I haven't tested the battery life yet but it charges via USB that is behind a rubber plug.If it wasn't for the weird audio processing issues I'd give this 4 stars. As it is now it would be fine for listening to podcasts or similar spoken word things and maybe if you don't focus too much on your music you might not notice the weird audio processing and it does look and feel nice which is why I gave it 2 stars but I'd really just suggest looking at another neck speaker.EDIT (about a week later): I have included a short video illustrating the effect that I am talking about. This is a particularly extreme example but you can hear the volume change immediately when the orchestra comes in that isn't present in the original file. The volume isn't particularly loud either; it's not even halfway up.(Details about the recording: I am using a condenser microphone (Nady SCM-707) plugged into an audio interface (Behringer UMC204HD) via XLR. I am using my android phone (Pixel 5a) to play the music on the Monster Boomerang.)A Monster representative reached out to me to send me a replacement which I accepted because it can't really be this bad right? Sadly the new one does the exact same thing so it's almost certainly a design flaw.I have also tried using this in a more "active" situation where I'm biking. This has sufficient volume and clarity that it still sounds good even with the wind and background noise. I also find that in situations like this the constant volume changing isn't as noticeable. And I also find that on most songs the effect is minor enough that it doesn't bother me.For the above reasons plus the good customer support I've raised my rating from 2 to 3 stars. I still hesitate to recommend this because the audio processing is a flaw that shouldn't exist. If you're planning on using this while active and not sitting at home or you tend to listen to mostly pop music with a fairly consistent dynamic range and sound level this would work well for you but for other uses it's going to be too distracting.
5,I have been using the Bose Soundwear neck speakers for a little over a year now. While they are amazing they are also almost 3x the cost of these. The Bugani neck speaker preforms amazing especially with bass and it sounds very clear during phone calls. They are also very comfortable I took them out on a bike ride and never felt like they were going to fall off nor were they uncomfortable. The Bose struggles with staying on when I'm doing activities so the Bugani definitely wins out if you want to be able to wear these around the house or on a bike ride. While they don't sound as good as the Bose it's pretty close and I would get these over the Bose if I had to choose again.
5,Update 9/19/20: Since buying these I have worn them multiple times every day and had to update my review from 4/5 stars to 5/5 stars. They are just incredible. I even ended up ordering a pair for my wife to use.Things I have noticed after a week of using include:- call quality is FANTASTIC. It is amazingly clear on both ends but using this is a game changer for being able to understand and hear the other person clearly- These are so addictive to wear and I often forget that I have them on after wearing them for a bit.- durability tests show these to be resilient after actively dropping them on pavement 2x from shoulder height and once from on top of ladder (because I forgot I was wearing them).- it makes regular speakers seem almost less-than in comparison. I've almost grown to appreciate these more than my vehicles speakers which I didn't see coming at all.Original review: I just received this product and couldn't wait to get it opened up and play with it. My initial impressions are that the sound quality is very good after testing it with streaming movies via Disney+ Amazon Prime and Netflix. I picked scenes that had a lot going on to test how well I could detect surround sound effect and it is very present and immersive which I'm very happy with.Build quality seems solid and time will tell how well it can hold up to being frequently worn. I am disappointed that it uses micro usb instead of type C charging but it is not an absolute deal breaker for me.Initial impression of volume is that it could be louder but probably needed to cut off at the level that it does to avoid hearing damage having the speakers so close to your ears. Music plays far louder than video but that is a limitation of the streaming services and not the bugani speakers. What shocks me the most is just how much ambient sound is actually blocked when using these. I tried having my TV play at normal volume while playing music at medium volume on the bugani and could barely make out anything coming from the sound system. If you were to compare these and my trekz bone conduction headphones sound quality definitely goes to the bugani. However they are really different animals and I only offer the comparison as they are both designed to allow your ears to remain open to ambient noise.Overall I'm very happy with the purchase. I'm not blown away by them but you can expect good quality sound and build quality from this product. It definitely does not feel like a cheap piece of tech and I would recommend before spending hundreds more for the Bose wearable speaker
3,First of all let me start by this is the second unit I have had from this company. My first one worked great for about 2 months after that it started having issues it would not work nor would it charge. Call Amazon customer service because I hadn't owned it long enough they were able to replace it with another easiest day. The second one about three weeks into having it works great and everything but for some reason the speaker that picks up the voice when you use it with your phone stop working. I don't have the heart to send it back again because three strikes and you're out. It is a great product when working as he should but because of the issues I have had with not one but two units I have to give it only three stars. I am going to look into purchasing a different one from a different company. The sound quality is very good.
5,I am pleased with the quality and sound of the Bugani wearable speaker. I am a return customer because of the previous Bugani M83 Bluetooth speaker I purchased was top notch.  Updated review... I was promised a gift when I registered my warranty with Bugani. They are not honoring their commitment and have told me it’s my responsibility to contact Amazon to receive my gift.  I am not happy with their lack of customer service. I am also waiting for the gift of a speaker cover promised by Bugani for my earlier purchase of Bugani M83 Bluetooth speaker.  They are just milking reviews with the promise of the gift in return.
3,I am still on the fence with this product because I need to be able to read the manual but uuuuhhhh why in the world would the instructions be printed in gold on black paper ... NOT CUTE!😒Second I am having problems pairing to my SMART TV. When I first purchased it it paired perfectly until I paired it to a not-so-smart tv (which also worked well) but when I went to re-pair it to the SMART TV it would not pair. Soooo Bugani is sending me a new one to replace what seems to be a defective unit.Let’s see how this goes.🤷🏽‍♀️
4,Easy to use comfortable and sounds decent for the price point. Wore them for doing house work yard work and laying down in bed watching a movie on my projector. Never did I feel like they were about to fall off and while laying down they remained comfortable for a few hours. The audio sounds good at 50% to 80% any louder and it begins to distort. I was very immersed while playing games and had forgotten they were around my neck got up and was confused for a second when the audio didn't fade as I walked away. Very cool! Wish it could get a little louder but that's a personal preference coming from somebody that's hard of hearing. All in all I would recommend these for the price to performance.
5,This design is very creative nice and light weight to carry. You can hear the music just like in a music hall and in a limited space you can hear the music in deep bass and high tone. When you hear the music with this speaker walking or crossing street you doesn't need to worry because you still can concentrate the rounding area. I wish it can connect to 2 devices in the next generation. Good speaker  will recommend to my friends.
4,I do virtual meetings all day long and get tired of only using over-the-ear headphones so i looked a pair of "shoulder speakers". I order these (Bugani M115) and a similarly priced competing Monster Boomerang pair. Both were similar for sound and microphone quality but I found the Bugani's more comfortable.I like the harder feel vs the more cloth-like feel of the Monsters. These were also a little lighter. I work in a hot climate and these feel cooler around my neck.An expected surprise was wearing these while driving - really nice! And legal vs headphones which you cannot legally wear in California.It would be nice to have 2 microphones one on each tip. (Though I find that most similar products also only have a mic on one side).
1,Microphone quality is so bad it feels like it doesn't exists.  I am in skype/MSTeams meeting all day and wanted something to replace my over-ear headphone and this seemed to be perfect by reading the review.  No issues in Bluetooth connectivity to laptop. But the microphone is so bad so people from the other side CAN'T HEAR ME at all.
5,So I got these as a cheaper alternative to the Bose system. And I have to say: I was NOT disappointed! The bass isn't as deep as on the Bose but it was still plenty deep. I got to use these while making a 1400 mile round trip in a car with no sound system and they performed wonderfully! The battery last me around 7 hours of continuous use and recharged quick enough.My only complaint is with the SD card system. Super cool idea but i wish there was a "randomize" function or something because it just played them in order every time. All in all it's a good system though!
5,This is a total surprise and turned to be a great gadget for me.It has become my companion for daily walk and jogging.Perfect for calls and music.
4,Its punchy. Good sound.Vibration noise sometimes depending on volume level and bass content.  But i have alot of options but i always grab these. Maybe because bluetooth hooks up automatically.  Well worth the price..
5,Music is so clear and so comfortable to wear. Excellent to ride a bicycle and much safer as you can still hear the traffic noise. My husband took ownership of mine speakers in less than one week after I received so I just bought one more LOL.
5,These are amazing!! I usually use ear buds and have quite a few pairs and was curious about how these would sound and feel around my neck. They are comfortable and also give crisp clear sound as well!
1,Great battery life and like audible battery low alert.  Sound imaging is highly dependent upon head position.  Horrible customer service.
4,Took 2 days to figure out how to connect it to my TV's.Connected it to two different TV's and couldn't get any sound.Tried everything multiple times and then all of a sudden it started working just about the time I was going to send it back.There should be a technical support phone number to call.
5,I love everything about it! Great device! Wonderful style.
5,These headphones have great sound quality and are loud. Great value for the price.
5,I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this product.
5,Bugani's neck band speakers have surprisingly good sound arevery comfortable easy to use and have long battery life. I'm very happy with this product.
5,It picked it hoping it would just work with my Apple Watch as other I tried didn’t. It paired easily and I love the sound quality!
5,This is very good. I use it to listen to audio books several hours a day and love it.
4,Excellent sound and a great design. I have a 19" neck and this is the only speaker of this kind that I can wear comfortably while its flexible shape prevents it from sliding off like most other models.
5,Lightweight  great sound and easy to set up and use.  Manual needs to be redesigned as the gold on black is hard to see.
5,This speaker sounds great and has Hella bass.
5,Easy Comfortable and plenty of sound
5,The media could not be loaded.
5,Amazing!! Super comfortable to wear and great sound quality!
5,Nice sound lightweight and comfortable
3,Good sound. Good for the money but a litttle bulky. Microphone not so good.
5,Great value and sound quality
5,Great sound and convenient to wear!
5,Great sound quality.
5,I am very impressed light weight for around your neck. Very comfortable and easy to reach buttons to adjust volume answer calls or change songs on music. Sound quality is very clear. I got this because as with wired earphones while walking the dog when you turn often can pull out earpieces and ears are blocked from traffic sounds or people around. This leaves your ears free for surrounding sounds. Excellent idea and great product.
5,So far awesome!! If it does everything I need it to I'll be buying more of them.
4,It's had great sound very portable for riding my bike
5,Battery life
5,Great product
4,Very large and heavy but great sound.
5,This wearable speaker sounds amazing for what it’s meant to do. Taking walks or hikes while being able to enjoy good music while being able to hear and monitor your surroundings. I Definitely recommend this speaker.
5,Its great quality
5,This is actually a cool item. Setup and connection to my cellphone was super simple. Sound is amazing. I have problems with those expensive ear buds staying in place in my ear so this was a no brainer.If I have one critic its that you're instruction manual altho attractive is EXTREMELY hard to read. Please reprint it in white  or in white include a link to a web page that is readable.Other than that I love this thing!!Oh and btw: it is very comfortable :-)UPDATE: Still works great. battery life has been awesome. SOOO glad I bought this product.UPDATE2: There was a card for a free item from them inside the box. Did all that it asked and received nothing. Sent multiple emails and still no response. Don't waste your time on trying to get the free item plus I can see that customer service is non-existent . They wont send you anything BUT I still love this speaker.
5,This thing sounds just fantastic.  Great stereo separation and definition.  So easy to connect I was glad I didn't have to read the instructions because I couldn't even if I wanted as someone decided to print a light gold font on a dark black card in micro-sized font.  I used a magnifying glass and a flashlight and still could barely make out the letters.  The speakers are great though - no more ear fatigue.
5,This is a great product. The details from the packaging from the material quality are great. It is very easy to setup. The manual is not needed. It has great sound and the microphone is also very good unlike other Bluetooth devices. Having the memory card is also a nice touch.
5,This is a solid neck speaker and is often on sale. Good quality and light enough that you barely notice it. Get this instead of the name brands that cost hundreds.
5,I use it all a couple of hours most days. I especially like using it while driving since in my state it's a legal alternative to earbuds or headphones while driving. Great sound good battery life stays paired to my iPhone up to 15-20 feet away while my phone is charging. This is the second M115 in our household and we're very satisfied with both.
5,I like the sound quality of the product. I have no issue paring with my device. The flexible material used in the product is quite good. It makes me feel comportable even if I wear this device for a long time.
4,Positives:Decent sound (though not stellar)Easy paringFlexibility of use.
3,When you connect it to a PC and watch videos the audio and video is not in sync.Audio quality is goodNice Bass as well.It won't disturb a person who is 2 feet away from you when your volume is low even a sleeping person beside you.perfect fit for the neck.
5,I owned a TWS earbuds from Bugani and I know the sound quality is excellent. I wanted to try the wearable speakers and saw good offer from Bugani. Without any hesitation I ordered it and amazed by the quality and sound specially considering the sound
5,Worked perfect. Bought on sell.
5,Great product and you don’t even feel the speaker after you place it.
4,Has pretty good sound quality hope to use it more in the future
5,Fit and comfort. Sounds good.
5,The sound quality is so good. I used to watch TV and projector via blue tooth connection. Very easy to setup. It will be even better if it supports Apple airplay in the future.
5,This is just what I was looking for.
4,Very clear but a bit heavy on my neck
5,Great innovation design. I always hate to have something in or above my ears. Now this works perfectly. Simple to use and great sound quality.
5,I love the Bugani products... I have two Bugani bluetooth speakers that I am really satisfied.All Bugani products are great price and good quality...I love them..
5,The sound is great
4,Great sound. Easy to connect. I would recommend to other with this good price
5,just started using it...amazing it is!!!
5,I love the comfort on your shoulder you don’t feel them but you can listen to music and also talk
5,i didn't expect about performancebut it was better than i expectednot heavy good sound quality fine with some heavy workthanks
5,So happy with my purchase  the sound quality is amazeballs
5,It was great buy. I wish to use it while cycling.
5,Great sound. I like that I can get great sound while still hearing my kids play.
5,
5,Excellent design and look. Very soft material !
4,The stereo sound is great with decent bass/depth in volume. In meetings however I heard some static at first but it quickly went away as I tinkered with some settings. No one had any issues with my voice  which means the mic is fine.The only issue I had is with volume controls. It for some reason does not seem to respond to the volume settings changes in windows control panel. Instead it does respond to the tactile +/- buttons on the device itself. I am taking one star away for this.
5,Sound quality is great
4,Great sound and quality.
5,They are really good indoor wear personal speakers. Lightweight and comfortable around the neck. They have good Bluetooth connectivity and have dynamic sound range. Connects well with both android and apple.
5,Another quality headset/neck speaker from Monster. I love using this at work as I can listen to music and talk on the phone while using both hands. A lot of times I have to troubleshoot with tech support on the phone. Sound quality is fantastic with no distortion even with a high volume. Battery life lasts me one day with a steady Bluetooth connection.
5,I love these i use them at work and while i drive i use em in my car to awnser calls ...i also use em to watch tv at night create my own personal space ☺️
5,I’m loving it
5,These are wonderful. Love the sound and the comfortable feeling when you wear them. The only flaw that they have  me is you’re not able to adjust the ringer volume on incoming calls and for me it’s definitely loud to be so close to your ears. So it’s just the ringer that is a sore spot for me.  Other than that I love my purchase.
5,Just received seems very nice except the box was extremely beat up but the headphones seem to be working. (The Box it was shipped in was fine but the actual product box was damaged)Update: customer service was fairly decent to deal with.  They were out of stock so instead of a replacement I got a full refund.
5,I truly enjoy the style. It fits nicely around my neck and the sound is amazing. Truly glad I made this purchase!!
5,I tried something like this for the first time never thought having a piece of tech on the shoulder would make things simpler  - tired of wearing earphones everywhere no more headaches. Must try this one the battery life and build quality is amazing.
4,I’ve just started using it and so far I’m happy with the ease of use and the sound quality!  I seen a co-worker using similar item that’s why I ended up buying.  I like that I’m able to still be in conversation around people I’m with and wearing it around the neck feels somewhat like listening to a background music like in restaurants.
5,5 Star - Great service!  Quality product!  Enjoyed using thus far!  Sounds good.
4,As always design and the quality of the material is excellent. It's comfortable to use long periods. I always forget I have it around my neck. I mostly used it for listening to music and it was perfect for that.
5,I tried the expensive ones and different kinds but this Monster was the bast of all. Loved the soundsbattery and the bass
5,I love this product I have referred people to it. Excellent clarity when using calls excellent sound impressive battery. Best Bluetooth headset I have
5,Overall good speaker and great sound .. love the look as well
5,I like the quality of the sound
5,Just received and can't wait to use it.  I like podcast and this much more comfortable than having ear buds.  Stylish design and wearability is a key factor.
5,This speaker when put on the neck feel really loud while other people can not hear it. It is perfect to use in library as it will not distract other people. I can even feel the bibration of the speaker on my neck. Best speaker ever 🙂
5,I love this speaker! I have been looking for a solution to uncomfortable headphones for a while. I tried this neckband and am so happy I did. A few things that make it great - It is very flexible and comfortable. I can wear it for a long time with no issues. The sound is loud and clear. It sounds like it is coming from a large expensive speaker. I have both my hands free with no cords. I wear it for washing dishes yardwork and crafts. I was looking for a way to listen to music and podcasts without the closed-in feeling of headphones. The battery lasts and I had no problem pairing it with my phone.
5,Quality of sound  is good . No problem with connection with bluetooth. Battery life is long enough. Made with good material and Item came really nice packed fast shipping. I like it.!
5,I have been using this speaker for a few weeks. It is very helpful and convenient for many conference calls while you are working from home.
5,It's light to wear around the neck.  Nice speaker.
5,Product is great allows me to ride my bike listen to music and still hear traffic. Due to the speaker size and angle doesn't disturb people like a bigger speaker for this it fits my needs.
5,Love this wearable speaker.  It's comfortable and lightweight.  I like that I can wear it while teleworking or around the house while cleaning and not lose the signal.  The battery life seems pretty decent too.  I've also used it while traveling to pair with my cellphone to listen to music or talk radio so I don't need earphones.  It's perfect!
5,Feels good on the neck. Not too heavy.dislike: none
4,Really like the sound quality and the sleek design.
4,I am impressed by the quality with regard to the price.  These wearable speakers have pretty good bass -- and that is rare for anything in this price range.  Thank you
4,I use these at my airport job they are very clear and secondly nothing like having that Bluetooth capability I can work and talk to the boss at home hands free
5,GreT sound quality.  I used theses during a phone call in noisy auto plant I could hear and the caller could hear me.
5,It has become my travel buddy. Sound quality  affordability and easy to carry wherever you go. A must have speaker for someone who hates to put things in ears.If it was little light weighed it would be the best speaker but with all these good quality I can lift a little weight on my shoulders.
5,My husband can't have headphones in his ears on the job and he can use these. He really likes these. They aren't too heavy and they have great sound quality.
5,My husband is extremely hard of hearing and he uses this at work to answer work phones. It is better than a caption phone. We have already purchased a second one for home while he is out in the yard so he can answer his phone and listen to music. This is an incredible product exceptional quality and stellar sound!
5,I like the fact that this neck speaker Allows you to listen and it does not bother people around you too much at all. A friend of mine let me listen to his Bugani Neck speakers and it was absolutely an outstanding product before I even bought it. The sound is great and the fact that you can listen to it without bothering other people is pretty neat. It’s not too heavy and it’s easy to operate. It’s a great product.
5,This is my second neck speaker and is one of my best purchases. I loved the sound quality and the bass. I use it during workouts and is just perfect. Good value for money. I am so impressed because I didn’t had much expectations for the brand but was pleasantly surprised. Definitely worth ever penny
5,love it great sound quality.
5,This product is a godsend for me. I can’t stand wearing headphones and this product solves that problem.I can play at low volumes without disturbing anyone as long as they are at a few feet distance.Sound quality is amazing. And it’s also water resistant.Used for running outdoors a few times. When running fast it may bounce around your neck. But you can always tuck the edges slightly under your jacket or tshirt so no issues.
4,Very good quality good sound and functionality is great
5,Very good
5,This is great.  Works rely good.  No problems with hearing others or others hearing me. Music sounds great.  Overall a great product !
5,Bought used the first product did not charge returned and ordered another. Im so glad I did. The sound quality is above and beyond. I have used the Oraolo M110 for 2 years and this is much better.Just need a type c charger to make perfect.
5,I was a gift for fathers day he loved and was very surprised by the great sound
5,They look stylish and great quality for the price spent.
4,If it sounds awesome
5,This BUGANI Wearable Speaker has become a great companion speaker in my daily life. I am using it on my house chores or also using it for my work conference calls at home. Speaker quality is nice and listening music at home is really practical since it allows me to hear other activities at home. I am really impressed with the quality of Mic I am using this daily in my office conference call and not a single time any complained about my bad or low voice.
4,Sound Quality is 9 out of 10. Battery Life is 10 out of 10 as it can give me more than 12 hours of playtime at 50% volume. Water resistance is incredibly good. It stays on my neck even at running above 7mph.It is overly good that I have to buy another one for my wife.
5,Wow!  This is our first ever wearable speaker headset and we are just amazed with the sound quality and the calls made on this device.  Design and comfort was a big plus! My whole family sat around listening to music for 2 hours as soon as we unboxed it. We tested out the incoming and outgoing calls and it works great! Crystal clear on both ends.  They said this is one of the coolest purchases I ever made.  My husband claimed dibs on it lol.  I will definitely buy this brand and product again.
5,Sound quality is good   and is well worth the cost compared to.cheaper options. Only downside is the Bluetooth isn't as strong as it could be.  Connects in my pocket but can't reach much further.
5,Great sound quality works in the rain and only charge it once a day
5,Very Good sound quality. I do not like sticking things on my ear. This is fantastic!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Wireless Monster Boomerang Neckband Speaker is a very nice and innovative option for a comfortable private video listening experience which makes no compromises with the full audio range of your content. This is a premium quality device.It is very comfortable and fairly lightweight. The shape follows your shoulders and chest to distribute the weight and ensure a good fit. The upward-firing speakers direct their output toward and in front of your ears giving you the sense that the sound is coming toward you and around you.If you like listening to great audio while moving around but don’t want to have your ears constantly covered these Boomerang neck speakers are awesome. Great audio for anything you’re listening to great battery life and a comfortable all-day fit. All in all very happy with my purchase.
5,I enjoy the solid wearable design.
5,I just got it and can’t wait to use it!
5,I was looking for something to replace the earbuds and I found this neck speaker I have a car without Bluetooth and this helps me talk and listen to music without covering my ears.
5,I was not sure if I would end up keeping this or returning it. As it turns out it’s just what I needed for working outdoors. As I move around my property doing gardening and weeding I get too far away from my portable speaker. At first I was aware of this being around my neck but after 30 minutes I got used to it. It’s a keeper.
5,Great sound quality. Would definitely recommend. Wanted a quality product without having to spend Bose money. Made the right choice with these. Good battery life and great Bluetooth connection. Says 33ft but I’m fairly certain I was a good 50ft from my phone without losing connection. Got mine for work and for hiking. Fits perfect with a backpack
5,My husband's very favorite Christmas gift.  Uses daily. Something happened to it and it quit working.  The company replaced it very quickly.  An excellent product with excellent customer service no reason not to go for it 👍.
5,Nice sound quality
5,Good light speaker with nice sound. Has slot for sd cards. Long battery life.Only issue delays in mobile games.
3,I also have JBL’s Soundgear. Comparing these Soundgear definitely does better in the sound department. The sound on the Bugani’s set isn’t quite as clear as the JBL’s especially for the mids and highs. Sometimes you have to strain to hear the vocals. For Soundgear you can hear the vocals clearly even when the volume is kept low.  However when it comes to comfort Bugani’s wearable beats JBL’s soundgear hands down. Soundgear is heavy bulky and totally not flexible. If I have to choose which one to put on most times I’d still prefer JBL’s Soundgear.
5,Boomerang shapes flexible and wireless Bluetooth speakers. Fits around your neck providing amazing sound quality deep bass surround sound. They are made of flexible silicone materials and can be carried anywhere. Equipped with a built in mic for clear and echo free calls.  Good for the athletic person gamer or just to be hands free. Excellent quality and great price.
5,When i first saw this i thought to myself why? But when you first put it on and listen to music it was a really interesting experience. its non invasive its nice to listen to music without having to block out other senses. It creates like a personalized surround sound. A very unique experience overall highly recommend! Really enjoy it for doing chores around the house.
5,I am truly impressed by the Quality of the Pure Sound Futuristic Shape and Deep Emotions I felt while using Monster Neckband for the first time. I usually ask Alexa to play classic music while I am working. Connecting the Monster Wearable Speaker Neckband made me feel emotions like never before: this pure sound with 3D stereo professional profile makes the whole difference! The experience is extraordinary and this device is worth every penny.With this product quality comes in every aspect not only Pure Sound:- fast connection to wireless and the range is impressive;- portability is fantastic - very comfortable to wear;- use it anywhere (fitness biking conference calls etc) it is waterproof- battery keeps the whole day;Without any exaggeration - this becomes my favorite speaker the symbol of a wearable pure sound device. Warmly recommended! 💥
5,Crazy great surround sound rich bass incredible definition—I can hear lyrics and music and sound effects so clearly when watching a movie at night—incredible value
5,This is a very good wearable speaker system that is ideal for gaming watching tv listening to music and even making calls.The monster Boomerang is made out of good quality components including great quality hi-fi speakers a fantastic rechargeable internal battery and a built in mic.It's easy to use.  Pairing it with my Andriod phone was straightforward I didn't need to install any apps.  I use it like any other wireless headset.  The Bluetooth signal is strong and reliable.The sound performance is better than I expected.  It sounds great  with lots of bass and clear tremble.  It sounds better than my stereo system.  The battery lasts for several hours.The overall quality and performance of the monster Boomerang is excellent.
5,Just an all around brilliant product.  Battery life: 1000 minutes as advertised 850 minutes delivered at 2 thirds volume - great performance as expected!  Sound quality: if you want your games or movies with no latency to sound like they were intended in a very personal space then this is the audio solution for you!  Brilliant 3d spatial sound tuned for quiet environments.  Works for most audio applications around the house or garden.  Highly recommended from a responsive and proactive merchant!  Enjoy!
5,I love this thing! It's like surround sound sitting on your shoulders.When wearing earbuds I generally only wear one at a time so I can still hear what is going on around me and it can be a bit disorienting at times.Wearing this gives me the freedom to enjoy great sound from both sides and still be aware of my surroundings - and no sweaty ears!These are lightweight and comfortable to wear they have a silicone base with a cloth top and the battery life is excellent.I thought this style was a bit gimmicky when first seeing them around but they have turned out to be my preferred speaker.
5,I wasn't sure what to expect from such a different form factor for listening to music but WOW!The package and presentation are professional and the quality of the neckband speaker is quite good. It is a little thicker than I was expecting but it's been comfortable to wear pretty much all day. It charges via USB-C and you get a charging cable in the box. I really with it used replaceable batteries since the internal battery will eventually degrade. That said I'm getting at least 7 hours of listening time with these and it has a max battery life of 12h. The speaker has buttons on the outer right "wing" which you can use to control volume playback call control etc. While this speaker lacks multipoint connectivity it can be paired to multiple devices and reconnect quickly between them. I'm currently using these with my phone laptop and TV soundbar. The neckband is comfortable but it loses its placement very easily when I'm moving around. The marketing for this product seems to suggest that you can use this while riding a bike or working out but I can't possibly see that as being practical without needing to adjust it constantly.As for sound it's surprisingly good. Not the absolute best but better than most earphones in the sub-$150 range. Essentially you get the benefit of speakers in a "headphone" size package.  The audio experience is unlike anything I've ever heard. The closest I could say these sound like are glasses with speakers built in (of which I also own a pair). You get spacial sound while easily being able to hear what's going on around you.  One caveat is that other people around you will be able to hear what you're listening to. Think of it as listening to speakers and not headphones and it will make more sense. The bass actually thumps in your shoulders/chest and both mids and highs are clear with both music and spoken dialogue.I do notice some mudding of audio when there's a lot of bass and it almost causes the mids to dip down in volume. This only happens with some songs but it is noticeable when it happens. I've been using these to listen to music TV/movies podcasts and gaming. The latency while gaming is very low - not AptX LL low but much better than other headphones I use. Disappointingly these only use the SBC codec and nothing better. Range is not amazing and I've had these cut out while the Bluetooth source is in the next room while other BT headphones can easily go across the house without any issues. These have been my audio daily-drivers and will continue to be used quite often as I truly do enjoy the spacial sound they provide.If they make a V2 of this product I'd love to see standard batteries and a better way to keep the band from moving while active. Other than that it's a wonderful product that offers a completely unique listening experience for a reasonable price.
5,Got this for my hubby Father’s Day gift he is really enjoying it. Sometimes in ear buds bothers him so this is a nice alternative. He wears it to go running or gardening around the house. Sound quality pretty good and battery lasts longer than expected.
4,Si me gustó pero me duele el cuello inexplicablemente. A los 15 minutos ya.minutos
5,Sound is amazing. also we created the way of hanging it around the house or backyard works great as well. The neck part is very "bouncy" so it's pretty comfortable.
5,Vélo et travail
5,I cannot tell you why i got this device or why it exists lol.But the sound quality the finishes on the product as very nice. It is not too heavy i would recommend using ot when stationary. The mic quality for call is crystal clear. When listening to music you can hear the sound loud and clear while people around you hear only a faint sound which I did not expect. Overall exceeded expecatations.
5,This portable wearing speaker by Monster blew me away!The speakers came in a very nice packaging. Inside the package came with a manual a usb-c Monster branded cable and of course the speaker with the Monster logo at the top.The speaker is very well made and feels really nice in my hands. The speakers are flexible and has a nice weight to them. However when I have it around my neck it doesn't feel heavy at all.Pros:1. IPX7 waterproof2. Battery life lasts me around 10 - 12 hours depending on the volume I use it at. It lasts me for the day. I charge them at night when I sleep.3. Flexible - I like that you can adjust the speakers to fit better on your neck. This makes the speakers very comfortable. I can wear them for hours without any complaints.4. The buttons are on the right side for easy access. Volume trackers for volume and change of tracks. A power button and a play and pause pairing button. On the right inner side is the charging port nicely hidden. No buttons on the left side.6. Very easy to pair.7. These speakers can get very loud. The base is very punchy where it can rattle your neck a bit. I love it. The mids and the highs are nice and clear. The sound separation is amazing.8. You can use this speaker around your neck (preferred way) but you can also leave them on the desk or bed.Cons:1. I wish there was a carrying case or bag at this price. This is not a huge problem because there are carrying cases available for purchase.Final Thoughts:It looks good feels good sound amazing and I dig it!  In my opinion the speaker is definitely worth the money. My friend has a neck speaker that costed her twice the money and after playing with hers and my Monsters I have to say the Monsters sound and feel just as good. I like that the Monsters are flexible and comfortable. Hers felt stiff around the neck.You can play games with these. I found that there was a big difference when using this speaker while playing shooting games compared to desktop speakers. I was able hear every step and where they are coming from and I heard things I never noticed with desktop speakers. I could here things I didn't hear on my desktop speakers. These speakers can get very loud and I am happy because I am about the loudness.I paired these with my movie projector and my friend wanted to watch a horror movie. These speakers made the movie scarier with the surround sound coming from the neck had me jumping from my seats. These are fantastic to use with watching movies.This surround sound speakers works great for listening to lofi music or CALM. The sound drifting from one ear to the other is soothing. It calms my anxiety down.The Bluetooth range is on par with other Bluetooth accessories around 30-35 feet.I recommend these speakers to anyone who likes to listen to music to play games to watch movies and for people with anxiety like me. For this price you get amazing quality and sound. I am a Monster product fan. I am very impressed with this product. Monster never disappoints!
4,Très discret et très pratique pour écouter de la musique dans la rue sans écouteurs permet aussi de parler très bonne qualité
4,I really like this neckband speaker. It is super light weight and sounds clear and crisp. My only complaint is that the bass is very anemic. Sure you can feel it in your collar bones but you can't really hear the bass in the music especially at lower volumes meaning some songs just don't hit like they should.The collar fits comfortably around your neck weighing next to nothing. I've found it super handy for when I'm working around the house but still need to be able to hear what is going on around me. It is a better option than ear buds in some case and a good solution for people with sensory issues.The controls are located on the right size of the neckband. You can easily adjust the volume play/pause and skip to the next track. The multi-function button also allows you to access your device's built-in assistant or answer calls.I don't recommend this neckband speaker for sports. It flops around a lot when running. It does work fine for biking and walking.Also be aware that everyone around you can hear your music as well. The speaker is directional so you get a nice surround sound effect but the sound is still audible to everyone nearby.
5,[PROS] 👍✔ Wide Soundstage✔ Sits Comfortably Around Neck: Clocked 5hrs of Jogging✔ Fantastic for Phone Call & Solid Microphone Quality[CONS] 👎✘ Volume Control Issues w/Apple Music & Spotify[PRODUCT EXPERIENCE] ★ ★ ★ ★ ★👉 The Monster boomerang is something that I never considered using until actually testing one. Now? Anytime I jog I ditch my headphones and use the Boomerang exclusively. During my jogs the Boomerang provides a good amount of volume and clear soundstage - from Hip Hop House D&B and Jazz I'm able to hear all the instruments and vocals in a surround sound format. When jogging at high speeds the Boomerang does wobble a little from left to right however that's expected and doesn't cause me any concerns.Moreover I spent 2 hours on a variety of different phones calls from business partners family and friends I was able to hear the person I was speaking with clearly and when asking everyone about the quality of my microphone they mentioned it's excellent and I can be heard clearly. This is also a good alternatives for those using speaker phone on your mobile given that you can hear the caller much better.***Monster Feedback*** --- Now for the most bizarre experience - I subscribe to Apple Music and Spotify. When streaming music with Apple Music I have to place the volume notch in the app at 50% to get 100% of the boomerang volume. If I pass the 50% volume notch mark to 75% or 100% the volume decreases significantly as if I'm decreasing instead of increasing. Spotify has the same issue but the volume can get louder on Spotify compared to Apple Music. With AM regardless of where I place the volume notch in the app the volume remains slightly lower (about 2 volume levels lower) than Spotify.  This isn't worth removing 1 star from the review since there's an simple workaround but I found this strange.
5,The Monster Boomerang Neckband Bluetooth Speakers have a unique sound field design that provides a simulated surround sound system to the ears. Its lightweight sleek and modern design makes it easy to wear around the neck.The sound on this Monster Boomerang speak is full and rich. Furthermore the performance of 3D stereo is superior to that of most portable Bluetooth speakers in similar price ranges. While playing there is no or almost no static hissing and distortion. The volume can be adjusted to meet individual needs. Of course it is not appropriate for those who require high-quality audio.Its Bluetooth works well and easily pairs and it can play effectively within the confines of the house. As a result it is one of the best options for those who do housework attend Zoom meetings take online classes or exercise indoors/outdoors. It also appears to be for those who want to protect their ears from headphones or earphones.However when I lift my shoulders or bend over my body it appears to fall or lose balance.
5,I am using this product while biking and is unbelievably comfortable to use. The sound quality is brilliant and has a powerful bass. Keeps you entertained while you get fitter. Worth a buy!!
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I'm glad I choose this MONSTER Boomerang Neckband Bluetooth speakers !So far they have been working well.The charging times are not bad and the battery life it's competitive with other brands in the market.The weight is not bad at all and they are very comfortable for outdoors and indoors activities.This Monster Boomerang Neckband Bluetooth speakers Give you the advantage of been aware of your surroundings ( hearing what's going on around you) meanwhile you can listen and enjoy to your favorite music or answering a phone call.IPX7 Waterproof that's a PLUS !!Bluetooth 5.0 not disconnections and very easy to pair .I test this Model in a rainy cold day and had no problems with them they still work as intended answering phone calls meanwhile outside and I had no problems with the people listening to my voice. Once inside I answered more phone calls and the people had no problem listening  without problems in audio or volume with no interruptions actually some people told me that they heard me better trough the Monster Boomerang than through the speaker of my cell phone !And that's a really good feature of the speakers to pick up the signal of my voice  !I ride my bike around and they stay in place no problem .When I jog with my dog I place then inside the collar shirt or inside the hoodie neck they stayed in place no problem.PROS:IPX7 WaterproofCharging cable included USB-CBluetooth 5.0Good Battery lifeLight and comfortableClear reception with smart phones.ErgonomicCONS : The Directional sound quality of the speakers it's NOT great It feels that you have just a pair small regular "cheap" speakers hanging on your neck to bad.They DON'T provide you with that 3D directional theater quality sound experience !They fall short in that environmental sound feeling the sound it's OK but it's NOT great .The buttons for control are not to intuitive and at times you are going to see you pressing the power button instead of the volume down.FINAL:YES this Monster Boomerang Neckband Bluetooth Speakers are a FUN product from MONSTER !!If you a re looking for a regular budget price that will don't break the bank and a good brand that back up their products YES indeed this MONSTER BOOMERANG are good choice .With room of improvement in the sound but will do the trick and are competitive with other models in the market in this bracket price .I'm enjoying them and looking forward to find out what other new features Monster can bring to the table !Thank you to Amazon.ca and Monster to allow enjoying testing the Monster Boomerang Neckband Bluetooth speaker !Kind regardsRafaelRaffi Reviews 2022.
5,Meilleur son pour la TV lors de problème auditoire je suis très satisfait du service à la clientèle que j’ai reçu
1,whenever turning on the speaker the volume always jump back to 57% until about 20 seconds later.Check the official website no technical support no firmware update nothing.
4,You can play/pause the music but there's no mute button available may be important to some people
4,I was not expecting amazing sound quality from the Monster Boomrang since the neckband is relatively compact and my experience with subpar Bluetooth speakers. However I was pleasantly surprised with how full and rich the sound quality was. The Boomerang can get quite loud and even at higher volumes the sound wasn't distorting. The sound was fun and energetic with good delivery across the frequency responses. Highs were present but not harsh. So was the midrange and vocals sound clear and detailed. The bass was punchy impressive since many Bluetooth speakers I've tried have had very weak bass. It could be the bass had more depth because the speakers are closer to your head making it sound better than a Bluetooth speaker sitting on a surface away from your ears.The Boomerang is fairly lightweight and comfortable with a soft touch rubber coating. You will still feel it around your neck but could be ideal for those that find any sort of headphones or earphones uncomfortable. The only downside I've experienced with the Boomerang is the noticeable sound and volume shifts as you move your head around. Since the speakers are directional moving your head around will cause changes in how you perceive the audio and is hard to describe until you experience it. If you use the Boomerang while you are mostly stationary there is no issue but if you want to use it while you're active these sound shifts might get annoying.
5,Je suis chauffeur d’autobus et je me cherchais un haut-parleur portable. Le son es vraiment bon et clair. Ça camoufle le bruit dans l’autobus!!!Je le recommande
5,I have had quite a few portable music solutions but nothing quite like this before. It’s very comfortable not too heavy and although the drivers have to be small they sound very good and the amount of lower end coming out of them is surprisingly robust. The music is very directional so if your not wearing it the sound wont be nearly as nice but as soon as you it to on and get yourself in the sweet spot its kind of crazy how nice it sounds. Nice and balanced soundstage and very well rounded tone. I honestly didn’t expect it to be this good. The microphone is not the best but i have absolutely no desire to use this for calling people. This is a perfect solution for listening to music while biking or walking. Keeps the headphones off your ears on the hot summer and directional enough not to bother other people that much when using it in more public situations. If you want a good sounding personal audio speaker than this is a cool unique option.

5,I have a mild phobia about putting things like earbuds in my ear and headphones on my ears so I jumped at the chance to acquire this "wearable speaker" and I am glad I did.The best part of this speaker is the bass response which makes sense considering the size and the bass going through your colla and with the placement of the speakers there is a definite 3-D effect.The battery life is excellent i can wear these all day without a problem.They are light so I dont notice the weight on my neck.I love this whole concept highly recommended.
5,Sounds loud to me but its not too loud for people around you. Bass rattles collar bones a bit. I love them.
4,So I work in residential construction where we have the freedom to listen to our own music when the urge strikes and for me it does all the time! I have battled with earbuds which are inconvenient and downright unsafe sometimes not the right form of portable audio for the jobsite. Traditional bluetooth speakers are great but I either have to tether them to me and they swing around and rest against clothing or my tool belt or wherever distorting or blocking volume and getting damaged in the process sometimes...or I have to leave it in one spot which I will regularly walk out of range from and end up breaking my connection. This monster boomerang seems to have the answer to all of my problems. It's a little heavy but to the point of feeling present not uncomfortable. The bass vibrates it somewhat something to get used to but also not uncomfortable or off putting in any way for me just adds to the experience. It stays in place reasonably well it does rock side to side a bit with lots of movement but you would have to be doing acrobatics for it to fall off your neck I think. The sound is great! Clear loud really decent bass...everything one might expect from a monster product I have even had to turn it way down a few times to have a conversation with someone! And with over 10 hours at near full volume the battery holds up for a workday! I recommend this for anyone who needs a Bluetooth speaker that goes anywhere they do!
5,I use in in the factory
1,Must bite by someone or animal! Have to return it.
4,The Monster Boomerang Neckband comes in a high end high quality very giftable giftable box. indeed I would be very pleased if I received one for a present. In the hand they are very well made from quality materials  have a high tec appearance and look like they're made to last. Once charged via the supplied USBC cable the battery life is quite .impressive.The Boomerang paired easily with my phone and tablet and can be used hands-free to make and receive pretty clear calls/video meetings (Zoom Messenger) and chats.The Boomerang comprises three distinct parts...speaker (with controls) a grippy collar for the back of your neck and a second speaker. The idea is that it should sit on the nape of your neck with speakers positioned either side to afford a stereo experience. This it does !The silicone collar is flexible to help with fit and hold. It is quite tactile. In my case it feels quite close and relatively tight.... but not overly uncomfortable.The speakers generate quite a sound-around experience...with quite rich vibrating bass and a surprisingly clear top end.  The volume also appears to be limited...not necessarily a bad thing for your ears. The power/volume controls are easily accessible and usable without looking at them. They are advertised as IP 67 so should do well in damp situations.My issue is that music is a personal experience that you may share with others. with the Boomerang you don't have a choice...it's music for everyone. This may not be an issue but to my mind could be a problem dependent upon where you want to use them...complaints about noise /public nuisance or taste in music (!).So the Boomerang is well made and works in a number of scenarios. If you are Iooking to wear it at home to listen to music immerse yourself in tv film or sport or to enjoy a different game experience go for it. If you are thinking about using the Boomerang in public I would think long and hard before purchase...do you really need the hassle?
3,This product seems to be OK for the price but it claims 12 hours Of usage I only got 7 hours of usage The sound is OK And the Box was also not sealed Or open Box which Amazon gave me a $10 rebate Solsea how that goes whether I keep it or not
5,I like the way you can feel the bass in the body. The only thing is that it's more like a speaker when in full volume but I liked it
5,This neckband speaker is such a cool idea. Sometimes my ears hurt when I use earphones or headphones and this is a great replacement for them. The music I listen to sounds great and I can feel the bass in my body.I’ve used it for about 25 hours so far I haven’t needed to recharge it yet. I’ve taken a few phone calls on it too and the sound is great. It easily connected to my phones Bluetooth and was ready to use in about 10 seconds.
4,I've been using this fir a week in a very noisy shop. The sound comes through loud and clear. It would help if there was a way to close the front once you have it on because if you're looking up and reaching for anything it will slide off. I will probably add a stick on velcro strap for that purpose.
4,Pros: Stylish easy to wear water resistant soft materials soundCons: A bit too heavy so so battery life no mute button.A bit too heavy on the shoulders and neck battery life is about 9 hour if using as a headset (talking with someone).I will keep my Boomerang but Monster needs to make some improvement.
5,Great product.Everything is very good from sound to built quality.I use it for music and movies at home.For outdoor its great too.I barely feel the weight around my neck.Monster should integrate some kind of strap to keep it stable for  extreme sport.I hope they will keep improving this new genre of device for the near future.It will be some kind of smart audio device with 3D 360 sound.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I like the product of this brand they are really  durable with best sound experience and also good battery life easy to connect via Bluetooth and fits well on the neck it’s light weight and feels comfortable wearing it. It’s easy to carry compared to older Bluetooth speakers. It works perfectly fine and I like using it and I recommend it
5,I have a pair of monster earbuds and just like them I’m so impressed with the sound quality on this boomerang.The sound has clarity and very balanced. A little more base with be a bonus.However the quality is exceptional.The make is very good sturdy and very comfortable to wear.I’ve been looking for another option to wearing my Bluetooth headset all the time and this is it. I can get things done and the sound is right at my ears.I totally recommend this product.
5,I was not sure at first what to expect with this unique-looking speaker that resembles a horseshoe. I thought it looked a bit silly at the beginning but I have quickly grown to love this thing. It projects sound well enough that I am in my own bubble but am still alert enough to see/hear other noise around me which is important to be aware of surroundings.  I could see it being useful for parents or caretakers for example.My friend who has tinnitus thought it might be a cool thing as well - and it is super helpful here. And these speakers produce a fantastic quality sound. I use them literally every day to listen to Youtube and podcasts. Super impressed with this product.

They feel very lightweight wearing them.The battery life is decent they do need to be charged they don't die too fast.Great quality for the price.

4,The idea of a speaker around my neck is definitely a novelty idea.The speaker isn't difficult to pair up and it has a pretty decent sound.I actually enjoy this way more than I thought I would!
