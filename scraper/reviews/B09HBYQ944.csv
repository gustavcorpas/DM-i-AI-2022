4,I purchased this item for my 2013 Toyota Prius.  I was able to attach the hook to the vertical vents behind the first horizontal vent.  However the horizontal vent was too thick to fit into the opening on the phone mount.  It could not be secured well enough to use for my phone.  I was disappointed because it seems like a very nice phone mount.  Fortunately it fits my friend's 2018 Honda CR-V and works well.
4,At first I tried to put the phone holder on the top of my vent which my vents rotate up and down so it started to fall but the lower I placed it on the vent the more secured it was. The holder also has the ability to change angles slightly to make it easier to view. The clip that also locks onto the vent works very well as I’ve had a vent clip before that just had two prongs and held onto the vent that fell off constantly where this one actually hooks and hugs the vent keeping it on. The holder is also good that the side arms extend pretty wide so both my phone which is an iPhone 13 pro in a slim case and my mom’s iPhone 8 Plus in a 2 layered chunky otter box both fit in the phone holder. The button release also works well but in order to have it extend fully you might need to repress the button or hold it down. Also a heads up if your vent has directional tabs make sure you angle the vent how you normally like it then put the holder between so you can still feel the air from the vent. Overall pretty good product especially if you can get it on sale and with the coupon. This holder is also a good option if you don’t want to stick anything on your dash. Hope this helps :)
5,I recently purchased a new vehicle and needed a new phone mount. My previous device had was a cup holder mount but doesn't work in my Honda odyssey. This one was easy to install and very sturdy. I like that it grips the vent clip and rotates. I have a pretty bulky phone and was happy that I didn't have to remove my case or popsocket. The mechanism to open and close were very smooth.
5,This little phone holder is flexible enough to hold 2 different size phones and it swivels without the phone popping out. It's easy to install and it does not require you to stick something on the back of your phone. Go for it.
5,This cellphone holder clips on easily to my ac vent. It's stable and easy to adjust to exactly where I need it to be. I can easily view this from driver's seat and easily adjust this for passenger to view my phone. Just make sure it's compatible with size of your cars ac vent
4,Really really liked this product.. have not gotten a chance to use them as I await delivery of my car.. just somehow I feel product may not last long… and I really hope that I am wrong because u really liked this product..
5,Great product especially for the price. The dashboard stick on my last holder melted in the heat so using the vent is a better idea. My daughter installed it for me without having to refer to the directions. The arms that hold the phone snap apart with just a push of a button. So far so good!
4,This phone holder is a bit hard to figure out to set up.
4,Me encantó este artículo. Muy resistente.
5,I got this for my boyfriend and now he uses it more often because his last phone mount was in the cupholder now he has an easier time with it.
5,Like this product  the price is good and it’s purpose works for what I need to hold my phone on in my car .
5,I’ve always had trouble with car phone mounts. They always lose grip or break. I decided to give this one a go and so far absolutely no problems. Seems sturdy. I’m hopeful it will outlive my previous ones.
4,Need more stability
5,It’s way better than the one she had before so that’s a plus and I ordered one for her friend as well the following week.. so far so good I guess
5,I’m impressed with the quality of this phone holder. It is holding and working well and easy to adjust.
5,Very good quality. Definitely recommend.
5,Awesome! Replaced my old one and this one is much better. It pivots. It's adjustable and it's durable. Great buy.
5,Really good for the price. It seems very stable.
5,Easy to install
5,-
4,Wish this actually held my phone up after the first week but instead it has to be readjusted nearly every couple miles
4,The photos show various vents this does not fit but there are others. The spacing between VERTICAL vent panes (Slats? The devices directing air side-to-side.) is also important. In the CENTER dash vents of a 2017 Chrysler 300C for example the spacing is not compatible with this holder. Bummer... That is where I want this! (I tried suction devices; they do not hold for long.) Works fin on a 2016 Subaru Outback.The good news is this is fine with the side vents - except I want it in the center!I do like that the clips have a mechanism other than pressure to lock into the vent. The instructions make it look a bit easier than it is (especially for a side vent with limited access to turn the mechanism). But once installed it works like a charm. As I am right-handed operation and removal of the phone is a bit awkward but I am learning! (Registering a left thumb fingerprint helped.)I thought about returning this but decided to keep it while continuing my search for something that will work WHERE I want it. Eventually this may end up in the Subaru or a grandkid's car! It really is well made and quite sturdy. And it does NOT pull out!
4,I like the way it connects to the vent opening. I have moved it around 3 or 4 times already just checking out the best place for it. Installation and removal was easy each time.My only concern is for the durability of the connection to the vent and then for the phone. I think it will work out fine. Price and delivery were great.
4,This product is easy to install as far as suction not enough to hold my phone. Needs more suction. But it holds my phone. Sturdiness is ok. If it makes sense.
5,This is the only one I found that really works with my 23’ Rogue!
4,This is a pretty good phone mount better than most ive tried. No issues with it attaching the the air vent though it was a little confusing at first. The side clips do not secure my phone very well and just from the sheet weight of my phone it does not stay in an upright position. So it looks like its constantly on the verge of falling out but the rubber on the side arms prevents it from doing so.
4,I've had a suction type phone holder for years. However over the years the rubber suction cup not longer grabs the windshield no matter how many times the suction cup and/or windshield is cleaned. I finally decided to look for an alternative and came upon this item based on reviews (which I weigh by determining the real reviews from the fake ones) the items description and my overall ability to determine if the construction of the item is solid or not.Pros: the item is well made and was basically easy to install. It is sturdy my phone doesn't shake while driving and it's easy to insert my phone and remove. The knobs that lock it in place enable you to position it exactly the way you would like it to be positioned.Cons: you don't have the complete usage of the vent movement which is why I gave the overall rating 4 stars and not 5. I installed it in the vent's fully opened position which is just fine because I use the vent next to it to blow on me when needed while driving. The only other thing I wanted but mostly my fault was the ability for the holder to hold my phone in its case. However my phone has one of those cases that holds my credit cards so it's thicker then most phone cases which is no fault of the holder.Overall I recommend this product and would purchase it again.
5,I like the product.
4,El agarre no es muy fuerte con el movimiento del carro hace ruidos lo hemos ajustado bien pero igual y yo tengo un IPhone
5,So installation wasn’t as easy as I was hoping. There is a dial on the back of it that you have to twist to lock it in place. Which is a little awkward because you have to hold the device with one hand while using the other hand to turn the dial. There also isn’t much room between the dial and where you’re putting it on the vents. So I found myself paying more attention to the dial and less to the positioning while I was turning the dial. Which prevented me from getting it locked into place the first time. Once I got it into place I really like it. One thing I found is you have to squeeze the sides really hard even after it looks like it has stopped you need to still squeeze it a couple more clicks because otherwise it’ll be loose. But it is actually easy to put the phone in the cradle and to release it. It releases with a little button on the back of it.The base of the cradle where the bottom of the phone goes doesn’t lock very well but it moves really easy. As long as you’ve got the sides locked into place fully that’s not too much of an issue but if you don’t lock the sides properly your phone might slip a little bit.Always have to make sure that it’s locked into place properly but from there it’s really nice and it is convenient and it holds my phone great. It will take a regular phone case but if you have one of the ones that has the cover that goes over the screen and while you’re driving you usually put it back behind across the camera and put it in it doesn’t hold that kind of a phone case/cover very well. I was able to get it to hold but it wasn’t very strong hold so I actually have a basic case that I use with this holder.Just had to learn it a bit. I do recommend this one.
5,I thought the the ball mechanism is a little weak.
5,Gracias
4,A hussle to screw on -- need both hands but holds well.  Someone make an easy to put on cradle please!
4,The only thing that I don't like is that it blocks the ac of that vent. I didn't think about that when I purchased.  Other than that it works fine
4,first one was missing lock nut.  replacement came a few days later  seems to be fine now  easy to install
4,Not holding tight but not sure I don't have it totally tightened so??
4,I've been searching for a good sturdy phone holder that didn't suction or glue to my dash. This was a little tricky to fit at first (had to use the driver's side vent) but once I got it to latch it has been a great place to keep my phone.
5,I read another review saying it didn't work with a Rav4 but took a leap of faith (many other reviewers didn't seem to get the install so I hoped this was the case here.) I have a 2014 Rav4 and at first it didn't seem compatible. The horizontal air vent blades are too thin and flexible and this mount clamps on to those.  However this thing is fully articulated in two spots!! Meaning I could rotate the clamp to fit on the much sturdier vertical vent supports(?) And it works beautifully. I'm pretty sure since it rotates to any position and has about 1.25 - .25 inch range on the clamp that you could find something to clamp this to in nearly every car. Seems average plastic quality and has a good grip. You can easily tweak the angle two ways without feeling like your going to break anything.  Bonus the vent blowing on the back keeps the phone from overheating in the sun from the dashboard.
4,I like this holder but I can not tighten down completely in my Tacoma air vent. I still like it and very functional for my iPhone 8 just a little lose.
5,Easy to install and holds my sons phone just great  but I have a holder on back of my phone-so doesn’t fit well.
5,This one doesn’t fall off.
4,Difficult to install on small car vents but works.
4,Excelente
4,keeps my phone in place
4,Very convenient when driving
4,On our Kia Soul the only vent it will work in with is the one to left of steering wheel.  So passenger cannot view it.  But I previously had the amazon suction one that adheres to the window --- it lasted 6 months then fell apart.
4,Much better than my not so hands free approach to handling the cell phone in the car. Much safer parochial and it is at the right height so I dont have to take my eyes off the road.
5,El producto es justo lo q esperaba que fuera
5,Great value
4,Initially I was ready to return this.  I have a Corolla and it doesn't quite secure the holder firmly in place in AC vents.  Not sure if it's the design of the corolla or not given the reviews are generally good.  Somehow I was able to secure it after multiple attempts to do so however it wobbles a bit when riding on uneven roads.  I looked for alternatives but couldn't find anything else that would work for me.  So far I like it. Much better than fumbling around with the phone on my car seat.
4,Does what it says.  It's steady as a rock.  The phone doesn't wobble and neither does the mount.  My only issue is the release mechanism.  It's supposed to widen when you hit the release button on the back.  It widens maybe a 1/10th of an inch.  Doesn't impact removal of the phone.  Just wish the spring was stronger to open wider.  But it is what it is.  Does its job.
5,Love it! Bought my son one.
5,Ty
5,This product holds my phone in place and it stays in place. It doesn't fall out of the vent of my 2021 Nissan Rogue
5,I got this for myself because I figured it would be easier for me to look at the GPS. I love how it clips easily to my car air vent and let’s me see the screen easily. Great car accessory find and I definitely recommend.
5,This is what I was looking for I Love it !!
4,After trying a couple of phone holders this one actually fits my Samsung Galaxy phone with Otterbox. So far so good.
3,Don't know if I was able to anchor it to the vent flaps correctly but it just doesn't seem to stay still.  Seems like it will snap every time I tried using it.  Might need to look for a replacement to this.
3,It doesn’t stay on when the case is on the phone.
3,I really wanted to love this. It was fairly easy to install but not on the first or second try. I’m still using it but when I push the release button the arms don’t really open because there’s some sticky stuff on one of the arms. I cleaned it off once and it came back. I have to press it a couple times to get it to open to take my phone out.May just be a fluke and others work just fine. This is just my experience on the one I received.
5,Like easy installation
4,Sturdy & well packaged.
5,This will fit in your car vent and fit many sizes of phones. It's adjustable to fit your phone just right and easy to install
5,This product was a great buy for the cost. It’s sturdy and expands to fit various size phones. The only issue is that we ended up using it in our van and not the car we intended. Our Pontiac has wider vents and the clips would not fit onto the vents.
5,WORKS GREAT
5,I’m an 80 year old granny and I installed this phone holder on my own.  I did use a flashlight to look into the vent.  Then I knew that there where other ribs  on the inside going the other direction.  This mad it easier to put the holding clamp in the right place and not try to force it into the vent.  It was easy to attach the part that holds the phone.  Using it is a breeze.  It’s easy to put the phone into and releases it quickly. Best part is the price !  About what I wanted to spend
3,Not very sturdy. Phone wobbles and falls out
4,Better than holding your phone in your hand lol
5,It holds my phone and doesn’t let it drop or get damaged!
3,It worked great at first and then within a month the cushion on the inside holding the phone in place flattened to be too loose and it falls out while driving.
3,Maybe it works for any car when it was i vented but not today.  I rented 3 cars this past June and it was only able to be used on one and only on the air vents by the window it also doesn't fit the vents in the middle of the car.
4,One of the better prices for a vent mount.  It was a little confusing at first how to get the mount part onto the vent (ball and joint connection).  The instructions are easy for how to get the stick part into the vent but not how to attach the two pieces together.  But once you figure it out it was easy to attach.  It isn't as sturdy as I would like and it is fairly large that it blocks the heat/air coming out of my vents.  But for the price it isn't bad.The release button is easy to use and you just drop it in and squeeze the two sides together.
5,Once I figured out how to assemble it it worked out fine. A little shaky but tightening is pretty simple. Just be sure to read the enclosed instructions.
5,I have had previous phones mounts that were all shaky unstable and easily broken. This mount is really great! It’s really stable and made well. I really like the single-hand operation for if I need to move my phone while I’m driving. It also leaves enough space to have the charger plugged in as well. I would recommend.
3,Did not work well for me in my GMC Sierra. Stuck out too far from the vent and interfered with the gear shifter.  Should have returned it.
5,Very sturdy. I was worried it wouldn't hold good on the vent but I was wrong it's perfect! Exactly what I needed
3,Liked the holder but the hooks that clip onto the vent were not long enough for my Mazda CX3 so I had to return. They advertise that the hooks are long but not for my car. Had to return.
5,Easy to install but it's alittle bigger fir the S22 ir sits onto the cradle & the side grippers cover the on bottom to the cell having to readjust the cradle.
4,I'm basically have the phone now but I cannot use it as it is not dependable to hold the phone in place
5,The product is very effective. It serves its purpose very well. I love to have my iPhone with the GPS screen on this phone mount for the vehicle.
5,Love this cell phone holder. Clicks in the back of the vent and doesn’t fall off. Warning does not work with the iPhone 13 pro max. Phone is too heavy for it. But worked great with my 11 pro max.
5,Finally found a phone holder that works great! It is easy to install and doesn't slip or slide all around. With the push of a button the phone releases only one hand needed to place in holder and remove it. Very satisfied with this purchase.
5,The hook locks onto the vent.  It takes a little time and effort but once hooked it is very stable.  That's what I needed.
5,The vents on my car don't fit the standard clip-on phone stand so I needed something will a longer clip and this product fit the bill.  Excellent quality and it only took a few attempts to get the product to fit in my vent.  The surface of roads in my area varies so I did notice I need to check/re-tighten the unit from time to time but that's natural with today's roads.
5,Nice and sturdy easy to use and attach
5,Easy to install. Easy to put phone in and take out. The retraction to take phone out is slow when the AC has been blowing on it. Holds the phone sturdy and easy to use charger.
5,Used this on an 07 Outback. Locks on Doesn’t get affected by the heat vent push button phone release out of the windshield view doesn’t affect view of factory controls and easier to view than the car radio.- (no unnecessary looking around. It’s right there.I’ll give it a 10 because it’s cheap too.
3,I wanted a case that would hold my note10 which has a case and a silicone credit card holder with finger ring on back and this is NOT it. the side arms are not long enough.
5,Good product.
3,Doesn't hold phone securely. Maybe ok for smaller phones.
3,I have an IPhone 2020Se.  I put an otter box on it for protection because I drop it a lot.  The company says it is designed to fit several thicknesses.  It does but the sides that slide in to keep the phone in place barely is tight enough to hold it in there.  I can easily pull the phone out of the cradle through the top without pushing the release button.  I feel like if the lips or ledges that are supposed to hold the phone in the cradle were a little larger it might be a snugger fit.  Glad I did not spend more for this product.
5,This little phone mount does a great job holding the cell phone.It goes inside the air conditioning vent and locks into place. It holds the phone very securely and neither the phone nor the mount had ever come out of place unexpectedly.Would buy for my other car but The air conditioning vents in my other car are too small
4,This phone mount is great! It is adjustable to most size phones. It was easy to install and it says where you place it on your vent. The only thing I have found that isn't ideal is that when I lock it into place around my phone sometimes it doesn't get tight enough and the phone will fall out. Could be a user error I suppose but most of the time it works great. Happy with my purchase.
4,Works very well for holding the phone high on the dash.  There is not much room to tighten the knobs to get it to stay put though and that was a bit problematic.  I could not get it to stay vertical but it did not matter on my dash since the dash itself prevented tilting down more than just a little.  The spring loaded mechanism to clamp the phone on is very easy to use and to release you just push a button and it pops open.
5,I loved this product. Can hold my 12 pro max phone WITH the case and doesn’t fall off the vent like other products. With a press of a button it releases my phone.
3,The phone mount is sturdy and good quality. What I don’t like it’s that it moves back and forth due to the weight of the phone and holder when driving.
5,Works great!
5,Super easy to install.  Sturdy and holds my phone great.  Only negative I have is that I use a wallet case on my phone and the arms are not very deep.  But so far even clinching the phone case halfway it’s holding.  Very satisfied with this purchase
5,Great phone mount for your phone. Just received this phone mount and it has been working great it does not move when I go over potholes and bumps especially driving on New York city terrible roads.
2,For the first few days it was nice held phone correctly and it did not move once tightened. But that all changed… I’m not really a fan of these when I see them in cars because it blocks the AC vent however I gave it a try at first all was great then it stopped holding my phone it kept moving around no matter how often I tightened it and as I drive it just slips right out goodness forbid I hit a speed bump the whole thing throws the phone forward and I have to readjust while driving… needless to say it was good until it wasn’t and it will be returned.
4,nice .fast.price rite
3,It doesn't cling to the vehicle vent very well and after only 3 uses the release switch for the phone broke. It is a clever design however but ultimately only good for a few good uses before it turns to trash. I understand companies making things obsolete to bring in more revenue bur you're selling cheap plastic with a false claim of stability. My phone is always jangling around on the vent because it will not stay attached to it. A couple times it just fell off. Drop the price a bit and you'll have a good product or take the mature route and go back to the drawing board.
3,had some trouble installing but it could have been me.  i cannot place it exactly where i want it but that is the design of the car nothing to do with this device.  i use it and it works well enought.
4,Phone mount is pretty basic and easy to install. Works fine but sometimes can be kind of wonky and not super sturdy. Something that can definitely be improved upon but the price point makes sense. If you're looking for more attachments etc maybe look to pay a bit more and get a sturdier phone mount. I don't use it too often so this works fine for the few times I do use it.
5,It is so nice to have my iPhone securely mounted in an optimum location and not falling down like my previous gadget.
4,Everything is good but it is shaking while driving so I can not read letters on the gps screen.
5,This cell phone holder is perfectly placed in the dash vents. Easy to see my phone at all times. Thank you!!!
3,I did not receive the clip part to my car phone holder
3,My iPhone starts getting loose after one week of use !! I can take my phone off without pushing the bottom on the back …! Not good
5,My husband was having a hard time finding a sturdy holder. I ordered this one for him haven't heard a complaint. He is always telling me how easy it is to navigate direction now that I'm not holding the phone for him lol
4,I have a sorta large phone. iPhone 13 max pro and this holds phone but not securely enough to me. Feels like my phone might fall if I hit a bump or drive over tough terrain.. We’ll see.. so far so good 🤞🏾
4,It was very hard to get it to tighten to the air vent. And I is pretty shaky but it will do.
5,sturdy was easy to install
5,Easy to install able to be put in multiple spots very sturdy and holds my phone well.
4,While it was easy to install and does hold phone it rattles. Very annoying.
3,If you own an older (2012) Prius this may not be for you it will not mount on the middle vent which is where I would have preferred but it will on the small vent next to the door. Its not an ideal location but the mount is well built and easy to use if the clip part was a little longer it would be a 5 star product.
5,This was a nice car mount unfortunately it did not work for my 2014 Equinox.
5,Has not fallen off the vent yet!! Buy it!
2,I like the ball and socket joint that allows me to orient my phone in a certain way but I didn't like how my phone which is an iphone XR was not very secure in the phone mount when I push in on the edges of the mount (there seems to be a little space between my phone and the phone mount). The only way that this problem can be fixed is if I have a thicker phone. I didn't anticipate this problem and had high hopes for the phone mount. Am a bit disappointed because I need to purchase a different phone mount. This may work better for thicker phones I think.
5,I have an iPhone 13 Pro Max and small car vent clips so I have had issues in the past with mounts that don’t hold up very well. I am super happy with this mount it’s easy to take my phone in and out of and it doesn’t budge at all!
5,A very good iPhone holder. Very solid build and hold the phone in position.
5,I love this phone cradle works great holds my phone perfectly
5,It’s not suction power because it clamps to the vent. I took this on a trip to navigate in a rental car and boy was I glad I did! The vents are always a little floppy but this device works in every car and can be easily transferred from one car to another. It will probably break one day as it is all plastic but the design is thoughtful and functional
4,It hooks up easy and pretty sturdy. I like it better than others I have gotten. We liked it so much we got 2. One for my husband.
5,I like it  works good
5,Easy to install works great
5,Really like the new attachment clip!
4,I bought this product for my husband. Once my daughter was born it was important for us to be hands free while driving so I thought this was a great item to keep us hands free when following driving directions. It turns out that it’s a great product and very affordable
5,My iPhone mounts easily and is very convenient.
4,Like how quickly this installed. It holds my phone in place and I really like how adjustable it is so I can easily reposition my phone from sun glare when driving. Good value for the price paid.
5,Excelente
5,This is the second phone mount that I have had.  i have a vehicle that has small spaces in the grid vent and the first one would go flying into the passenger foot well while I was driving.  This mount has a smaller insert with a hook on the end which enables the holder to be inserted properly and there's a tightener to hold it in place.  Work's very well in the ac/heater vent next to driver
4,I use this to hold my phone gps on long trips. Great purchase!
4,Would not work in my model car.
4,It worked great. It does have to go inside the AC vents. That’s the only downside but I don’t mind it there. If you like your air blowing directly on you this will prevent that. Other than that love it and would buy again.
3,It's pretty easy to setup though it is definitely not sturdy based on my experience with it in a BMW Z4's center vents. For such little money I guess it's ok.
4,Installed easy then tightened and seems to work great so far. Nice fit for our phones . Has a notch to let charger cord into phone. I hit a solid dukes of hazard style jump with my minivan  the wife was more shook than my phone.
5,Me agrado el agarre que tiene y no se cae el celular 😉👍🏻
4,Not bad fairly easy to install pretty sturdy not sure how durable it is I guess time will tell and price is ok. Good bang for your buck I guess.
5,Good product
3,Hard to install and part that mounts to vent not very secure. Part that cradles phone is great.
4,The phone mount allows me to see the maps and other widgets on my phone while driving. It also helps her select music without sticking the phone in the dashboard pocket. Safer driving is hands free while using bluetooth of course!
4,Nothing bad to report so far.
4,Hard to install
4,Does the job but I wish it was more sturdy. You can adjust it but it's still pretty wobbly. For the price I'm fine with it.
4,I wish that I was able to keep and use this product for its intended use. It’s by far the most well built phone holder on the market IMO. Unfortunately I had to return this product because it wouldn’t work in the location where I needed it.  I’m still searching for something else to use.
5,The media could not be loaded.
5,I have used a Phone cradle mounted in the cup holder for several years. After viewing this holder that comes off you air vent I was intrigued to try it. I first bought one for my son and he loved it.As a salesman on the road I was looking for a safer more conveniently located spot and this is perfect.It keeps my eyes forward toward the road and npt moving to the right away for the road. The closeness is perfect and I love it! The right price the right quality and I highly recommend it to anyone !Harvey
5,Would buy it again. Easy to install.
5,It works perfectly for me very easy to attach to the car and stable when driving. good product.
4,I really like this phone mount. It’s great if you have a pop socket or a thicker case. I bought two. Would definitely buy again.
4,M new phone mount came easy to install I did feel it was a bit wobbly but it was probably the way I had it mounted. Would buy again.
5,I like the padded surfaces.  Easy to install.  Holds cell phone secure.
4,It kind of droops down when my phone is in it putting it at an awkward angle for viewing if I take my case off and but my bare phone in it it is a little bit better
5,Super sturdy. Easy to attach. Easy to use.
5,This did not fit into my vent at all even though the picture showed a long shank and I thought it would. Too late to return.
5,Best cellphone holder
3,Didn’t work for my cars air vents. (Toyota BRZ) Gave to my son and it didn’t fit well in his new Honda Civic either. Maybe works better for cars with the older style “longer” vents that the clip can actually attach to properly. 3 stars since the quality looks decent. Just didn’t work for our household.
4,This is a great product sturdy and well-made but unfortunately I didn't look at the pictures and it doesn't work well with a vertical vent which is what I have in my Cadillac. It slides down because of the weight of the phone then tolts and the phone eventually falls out.
4,A little rough to install used the clip in to the vent option. The alligator clip was tough to grab on to a vertical vent but once on it works great!
5,Follow the instructions carefully to get a secure attachment to the air vent.
5,Not that great of a product. Fitting it to a vent is not practical and the grip for a phone is not that great
4,I do hear some rattling from the holder time to time. But way better than any other holder I’ve had.
5,I bought several phone car mounts seeking a mount big enough for my Samsung S22 Ultra in itsCaseBorne V case.  This is the only mount that I found that was big enough and secure enough.I use it with the gooseneck from the "FLOVEME Gooseneck Cell Phone Holder".  The parts are interchangeable.
5,Seems to stay on the vent very well I am pleased about that!
4,For the most part easy to install and seems to be sturdy. Can only install in certain vents on both a Nissan Altima and Frontier.
4,This product works great and is very easy to use. It keeps my phone sturdy and in place and I don’t have to worry about it Dali g while I’m driving
4,Holds phone well and is easy to adjust. Could hole in car vent a little better. All in all I like this product and would recommend or buy again.
5,Just as described. Fits my vent perfectly.
3,Appears to be a well designed device. However if the air vent adjusts up and down the weight of the device (let alone the phone) causes the it to fall forward making it essentially useless. Probably a dash or cup holder mount will work better for autos with adjustable air vents. Returned.
2,It comes in 2 pieces and you have to put together. Instructions are not clear and I had to mess with it to figure it out. Was getting frustrated. When you want to put the 2 pieces together you have to loosen the know behind the phone rest part so that the attachment goes in. Otherwise you will break it off.
4,Installation was easy and it’s sturdy. It can hold iPhone XR. It’s been a month I’m using this and it is sturdy and didn’t come off. It’s worth the price.
5,I previously had a phone mount that also clipped to the vent of my car. It eventually got loose and stopped clamping onto the vent but this one is built with better materials and has a locking mechanism that will probably last probably last a lot longer. It securely holds my Galaxy S21 and even has space for me to leave my charger in while driving. The quick release button also makes it easy to take my phone out. I'm very happy with this purchase!
4,Not too difficult to install. It holds decently and only requires tightening every now and then (depending on what you are driving over though).
5,Great grip
4,I have a hard time getting these to fit my vent fins as they are thick and vertical  this works well and produces a sturdy platform for my phone
5,It took me a minute to figure out how to mount this in my air vent but as soon as I did I realized it was not going anywhere!  Unlike the last phone holder I had which constantly fell off the air vent this one has stayed attached!  I have had it for a month now.  I can pull my phone on and off of it knowing it is not going to fall off the vent.  I am very happy with my purchase!
4,Everything is fine it’s just the release button is on the weird place at the back. It is difficult to press that button. Other than that phone mount does the job.
3,I had a hard time getting it to tighten around the vent slat to keep my phone stable. Once I got it it works great
4,Took a minute to install because I didn't have much light to do so but once it was installed it worked like a charm.
5,Nothing
5,So far it's the only holder that hasn't fallen and dropped my phone. Great product!
5,Easy install and well built.
5,We bought this for our daughter who is a new driver and it is perfect! she put it in the air vents so at least she isnt looking down on the seat or in the cup holder. And while she shouldnt be texting and driving or looking at the phone she does on occasion. If or when she does she is looking up and almost directly in line with the dashboard and front windshield. This was a great Christmas gift for her
4,The reason it's only four stars is because it rattles a little when I'm driving but the phone stays in place.
5,This car phone mount was better than advertised. It fit easily on the heater vent which put it that the perfect height and distance from the steering wheel in my Dodge Promaster 1500 van. It was installed in seconds and its intuitive design allowed me to quickly lock it in place just as I like it. The quick-release function is great. I can just press the button on the back grab the phone and go. Great product for a good price.
3,It’s easy to install and holds onto my phone which is great but it doesn’t stay upright- it just sags?? A little disappointing but I guess it works
5,Easy & quick Installation and sturdy hold/position. It does cover your entire vent so you lose the full air flow of the vent you choose to use. Otherwise a good product for the money.
5,I decided to try a vent mount design over the dashboard top mount which refused to stick even when using the bonding agent.  I am mostly pleased.  I did have some trouble mounting it to the vent at first but I blame this more on the car vent design rather than the mount.  Once on however it has proven sturdy and its swivel mount makes for easy viewing at a glance.  I'm happy with the product and would recommend it to friends and family.
3,I have a 2005 Taurus and my vents can be turned up and down. As a result the weight of the phone pulls the vent down so that it's facing the floor of the car. It would also work better with a phone in a case. I don't have a case for my new phone so it slides out some times because it's almost too narrow for the clamps. I plan to make a few adjustments and keep the device but just keep in mind that the weight of the phone will pull your vents down if they move.
5,Just what I expected
4,Instructions do not mention the piece that is responsible for not letting phone weight drag the holder down
3,The piece that goes in trough the vent is too big that is no possible to install this in my Honda Pilot. The mount looks good though.
5,I love the adjustments and suction on my cellphone car holder it supports my phone safely
3,Does not carry iphone 13 pro max it goes down ever though it thighten
5,works great
4,Worked well. It did fit better in my 2016 Kia than it did in my 2020 Kia however.
5,This product was given to my 16 year old for her birthday and we're very pleased! She can put her phone on the mount before putting her car into drive and use the blue tooth hands free to listen to music or if calls come through answer safely. It is a tight fit on the air vent so it doesn't come flying off when turning a corner like other products of the same sort do.
5,good
5,Study phone mount. I needed a phone mount to hold my phone but I didn’t want one that I had to insert in my cup holder because then I would lose a cup holder. I was skeptical that a phone mounted to my air vent would hold up the weight of my phone but this mount has worked perfectly. No issues . I wish I would have bought it sooner !
4,Product was easy to install in car doesn’t take up windshield space like others and is a good price.
5,It worked very well on both of my autos and was easy to install. No wants of dislikes about this product.
5,I like how this product was very easy to set up and worked in a variety of my vehicles. I find that the phone mounts that use a suction cup or a sticky pad tend to not work as well and end up falling off but this mount through the air vent works all the time and hasn't failed me yet. And for the cost being relatively inexpensive I find that it was a great buy!
5,It’s secure very sturdy easy to hook & I love it.
3,I wish it was sturdier than it is in my vent. Twice my phone fell out of the holder and when the phone is not in the holder….it rattles way too much.  I would not buy this again
4,Bought this for my husband. He is very happy with it and says it works well.
5,Had A Lot This one Works
4,A bit tricky to figure out where it goes on the vents. Sturdy once secure.
4,It worked perfect. would absolutely recommend this product.
5,It was simple to install the phone looks secure and for the price it is a good quality
5,My husband loves his car mount. He uses it all of the time it worked perfectly with his iPhone 8 now he uses it for his iPhone 12 and my iPhone 11 Pro Max. Very adjustable for the difference phone sizes and the phones never fly off when you hit a sharp corner lol.
5,This is the sturdiest car mount that I have used and love that it connects to my vent and can be tightened on. My iPhone12 is perfectly snug and doesn't shift even when I'm going over any bumps. Also like the design because you can easily hit a release button on the top which allows the "arms" to extend so you can get your phone out easily. I also like that plugging in a charger is easily accessible at the base. 100% would recommend!
2,Was not able to insert into air vent well enough to provide any stability for phone. Gave up and am now looking for alternative to suction cups on windshield. This was not it.
5,Doesn’t shake around and fall off on our bumpy gravel off road private drive.  Very stable.
4,I have tried multiple phone car mounts & none have exceeded my expectations then I came across this one. This one actually can hold my phone’s weight (iPhone 13 mini) & can swivel without breaking.
3,Does not fit an AC vent with vertical louvers properly. Will fit Horizonal louvers. 2018 GMC Terrain doesn't work together. Wouldn't tighten snuggly without still moving around
5,My husband's car phone mount broke and I had to shop for a new one for him and this one definitely became his new favorite. He likes the design and it's easy to use. He's very picky and I kind of expected he'll find things to complain about but no he told me it's a keep! I'm so glad I don't have to look further and go through those return hassle. In short an awesome product.
3,It’s good not great.  Pluses: Easy to install easy to rotate from portrait to landscape phone position extra height and depth makes it easy to keep my max pro iphone with it’s case on the cradle.  Minuses: only moderately stable.  Sometimes wobbles doesnt have a counter lip for the vent fitting so only one lip so wobbles boom is so long that the phone cannot rest against the dashboardmy vent has vertical slots behind the horizontal ones and the boom of the phone cradle has to forcibly separate them to work.  It worked but i’m concerned long term it may cause damage.
4,It is easy to install. It fits all of my cars vents.
5,I have an iphone 12 and out of the three car mounts I have tried this is the best one by far. Its actually sturdy and is super easy to use. I have had it for 4 months now and its still is like new even after using it every day.
5,Used for car
5,When installed it is somewhat loose.
3,Difficult to insert into vents. Doesn't stay well.
5,Bought this car phone mount for my son. He uses it without fail - I believe it has helped with digging for his phone while driving.  Mounts securely and easy to reach.  Very pleased and will purchase for our other vehicles!  First experience with this seller and it was seamless.  Product arrived intact and well packed and on time for Christmas.  Pleased.
4,It was a great product before the plastic attachment broke in my vent.  But help my phone perfectly!
5,I purchased this for a round trip drive from PA to FL. We use our phones for GPS and needed something reliable to keep our phones where we could see them and access them easily. This did the trick. It was so easy to install held up well held our phones with no issue and worked exactly like it said. I would absolutely purchase this again.
5,Not all vehicles are able to have a phone mount mounted by suction on the dashboard. As a result I wanted one that attached to air vents and this product works perfectly. I bought this for my 2011 Toyota Highlander and installed it within seconds. It tightens well and keeps my iPhone 11 in place without issue. For the price I'd definitely recommend it.
3,Overall this is pretty decent. It has not fallen off and keeps my phone in place. It works for me!
4,Great Product! Phone is eye level exactly what I needed.
4,Great Christmas gift! Got one for myself and my boyfriend!
3,Item does not stay secure on the vent. It comes loose frequently and requires adjustments.Just ok for the price.
4,This works very well and is fairly sturdy.  I'm happy with it and would purchase again.
5,I love this product after trying multiple ones similar to this this is the only one my husband will use in his car ! I was hesitant to try another one but this is the only one that has ever worked It's very easy to install and it works great with his iPhone! So happy we finally found something that works!
5,I like that it fit in my car without damaging anything and is very sturdy.
4,Excellent phone grip and easy on the vent fins.
5,It is the best Car Phone Mount I have used. I have used 3 different car mount  they all have the same problem it can not hold your phone tight. This one is different it has a different mount system which hold your phone very tight. Having use it for month it never drop and very easy to take your phone off with the button at the back.
2,The phone mount was not stable on 2014 Toyota RAV4 cabin air vent. Also due the extensive weight of the mount on the vent it would move with the car as I made turns. Lastly the phone clamps would loosen the grip on my iPhone 12 Pro Max so my phone isn’t secure in the mount.
5,Super easy to install works Great
5,Product was what I expected it !
4,Easy to install works great
2,It be OK if you could just lock it down tight and it didn't move. Not happening.
5,I was concerned as I have purchased other mounts that would not accommodate the size of my phone. However this mount made it easy to expand to fit my phone and hold it securely. I was able to install in a vent out of blocking view of my windshield yet close enough to glance at & see.
5,The product works well. The adjustment feature is good. It holds well to the vent. The product is well built. Simple to set up. Overall a good product.
5,It works great but you only need 1.  It is little challenging when you use 2 at same time for space issue.  Works great
5,I rent cars for n a weekly basis this thing is awesome it’s worked n every vehicle so far. Fits easily in my backpack!
5,This is the best phone mount I have ever had. It locks into the vent. It's wide enough for my phone case. I kept buying phone mounts because I was trying to find one that works for me. This is the one.
5,Works for the purpose it was purchased.
3,You cant sit your phone straight up..phone is not adjustable once on there. Because of the heaviness of phone. If that make sense. Just find a better phone holder..if you're on a budget..it'll due!
5,It holds the phone very well. It does not tilt while driving on a bumpy road (as most do). It grips on to the phone nicely. I would recommend buying this especially for the price!
5,This item ended up being better than I thought it would be. It really is sturdy by the way they have it connect to the vent. It’s easy to use as well.
4,It seems very stable & the phone fits perfectly.
2,It’s too flimsy not sturdy enough for a phone holder in vehicle.
5,Phone is easy to mount and release in holder. Needed to adjust position of mount multiple times before finding correct placement for my car - it sits out from the vent a little bit which placed it too close to the steering wheel. Easy enough to install.  Phone cradle tightening and release works well so far.
5,So far so good. I have an iPhone 11 with an Bandolier Case and it held it in place with no issues. Crossings my fingers I have not issues once I get on the road.
4,Good product .. works well in a 2012 rx350
5,This is a great vent holder.  Holds the note 21 with the stylus on the back of the case. Most holders grips aren't deep enough to grip the side since the back stylus makes the case thicker. I would recommend this produst
3,The clips were not long enough to hook onto my car's AC vent but when I put my phone in it felt secure.  I had a hard time tightening the back to keep it upright.  It just wasn't compatible with my car (2016 rav4)Update - customer service from the seller is great.  Even though this product didn't work for me I would buy other items from this seller
4,Great product
5,This is a far better design for keeping the phone mount in place and not having too much trouble installing it. The other types just got weak over time and bounced the phone right out of the vent if we hit a big bump or pothole. I would recommend this.
5,Love this cat mount! So useful and I love that I don’t have to worry about holding my phone anymore for directions while driving. Was extremely easy to install and can put it where you think is most comfortable and easiest for your vision!
5,This is a great product to have! All previous ones broke easy or didn’t fit right for my truck. This one fit and is sturdy.
5,This phone holder is very reliable and doesn’t move around when I drive. It’s easy to adjust and can fit any size phone since the phone holder has adjustable sides and an adjustable bottom. I have a XR with a thick case and it fits perfectly. I highly recommend this product!
5,I was specifically looking for a well reviewed car phone mount that was sturdy but also could handle the weight of my iphone and hold a phone with a wallet and cards on the back. I was pleasantly surprised that this holder had enough depth to secure my phone and I have had no issues. So far so good!!
5,Stable and easy to install.Also easy to place and remove the phone thanks to the button in the back.
5,Absolutely love this! I tried so many phone holders but they just didn’t work. They won’t stick to my windshield or my dashboard. The ones that stick to the vents always fall off. Not this one! It sticks! Finally found a great product and a great price!
5,It works for me a good thing to have.
5,Feels stable holds my phone well. It was easy to install. I like that it rotates 180 so my phone can be vertical or horizonal. I release was a little challenging to get used to but now I can stow and retrieve my phone with one hand.
5,Bought this mount for my daughter and she loves it. I use her car often and I have to say it is sturdy and holds my phone securely. It is designed to securely hold the phone and allow for the charger to be connected too.
5,I bought so many phone handles and this one is the best one!!! I am using this one for a month before give a review. It is easy to install and just never move or fall down so easy to use and will fits to any phone!!!!
3,Honestly thought this was versatile and read everything before purchasing! Really disappointed to find out it only works with horizontal vents. I don’t think it was mentioned….took away 2 stars because of that…I am sure it would work otherwise
3,I have a 2013Ford F150  The fins in the ac vent are larger in depth than the mount is designed to handle.  The only way I could make it work would be to glue it but then I could not remove it without breaking the finsIt’s a great product  Well made and great design but it does not fit my vehicle
5,So good and stable
5,It was easy to install and is easy to take your phone in and out. It doesn’t fall out of the vent. My phone is protected while driving and I am safely able to use my phone when needed for gps purposes.
5,I’ve used a few other car phone mounts before and this one Is by far the best! It has a vent bracketing set up that is different from the others I’ve used. It is much more user friendly and sturdy. I definitely recommend this product!
5,I am very happy with my new car phone mount this one holds better than the last one I picked up from a five below store. This one holds my new iPhone pro max phone which is a large phone. It’s sturdy and works great while driving.
5,I have tried a few other car holders for try phone but none really worked that well. This unit mounted easily and actually expands to securely hold the phone even in a robust case and with the card holder stuck to the back of it.
5,I love it.  I also ordered my husband one.
5,While it was tedious to install (at least in my car) once it was on it was SO easy to use.The product is very nice quality and holds my phone very steady. Completely customizable to what angle I want. I highly recommend this.
5,Best one I have owned. Definitely choose this product.
3,This thing is frustrating. It sort of works if you angle it a certain way but most of the time it’s loose and doesn’t hold the phone well. Opt for a more expensive option if you want one that really works.
3,The product seems fine it just was not a fit for the vents in our vehicle.
5,Easy to install works good.
5,I was shocked when I finally realized the twist in the back clasps on to the actual vent! It didn’t click for like a week but now I’m thrilled to know the sturdinesses is there and no more shaking. I like the way the clasp holds the phone and releases it! I definitely think this is worth it for the price If you’re looking for one!
5,What i like about this phone mount is the sleekness of it. It is not bulky and looks good. Super easy to install. I can’t give the sturdiness a 5 star because it is wobbled no matter how much i tighten it.
5,Makes life so much easier when navigating traffic and/or waiting on a call/message while driving.  Easy to install and adjust to different phone sizes.  Buying one for all of my cars and all of my friends.
5,This phone mount was easy to install.  It seems sturdy and keeps the phone secure... you don't feel like it's about to pop off the vent.  It's also easy to move if you want to use it in another vehicle.
5,I needed  to replace a metal dash mount for my iPhone and this worked perfectly. It grips the vent better than other mounts I've tried and looks elegeant. It also has a slot for the charging cable so it isn't at an odd angle. This was a good purchase.
5,I order this hoping it would fit my truck I returned others that did not satisfy my usageThis one is great it has a long enough reach for my vent and it is very sturdy. I would recommend this to everyone
5,Perfect great product.
3,I've been in search for a new car phone holder. It was a fair purchase but it's not staying installed in my car vent the way the directions explain. I've only had it for a little over a week and now it's not as sturdy.
5,I was recommended by a friend. This phone mount works great since I bought it two months ago. My phone is very sturdy and it works well for different sizes of phones ( my husband and I). I will get another one for my husband as well. Definitely suggest!
5,Easy to install n stays On solid.
5,Does what it supposed to - great value for the price!A simple phone mount for a car that is sturdy easy to install and I really don't see the point of getting a more expensive one.Highly recommended.
5,I just used this for a trip to Seattle WA. I always rent a car and with this mount I was able to navigate very easily because I did not have to hold the phone while driving.
5,The vent holding arm twists instead of a simple spring action. The form is also stylish instead of lower grade function only designs. I recommend it highly.
3,Was not easy to install I return them.
5,I bought 2 of these phone mounts for my parents for Christmas and they both love them! They were fast and easy to install super easy to use and hold their phones in place without moving around. Would recommend to anyone!
5,Install super simole and sturdy bought 2 more as they don't fall and hold the phone well  easy to remove.
2,I ordered this phone holder based off reviews. Received and was not too easily installed. As soon as I did I realized it was not secure. It does tighten from the back of holder to AC vent but not enough. It moves when your vehicle is in motion and if your phone is not on holder RATTLES LIKE CRAZY!!! 🤦🏻‍♀️  Even when I’m not using it for navigation I MUST put my phone on it or the noise is just not tolerable. I don’t really write reviews but I had to on this one because all of the others who glorify this holder must have received something other than what I have. 👎🏼👎🏼
5,Sturdy and well-made. Holds my phone snugly and stays in place.  Very satisfied !
5,This product has been a great addition to my car! It is easy to install looks nice and it makes reading directions a whole lot easier. I highly recommend this product I even bought one for my daughter!
5,It was easy to put in my car. Did not fit in my vents but attached perfectly to my tape deck that’s out of commission.  Holds my phone up great even on big bumps.  Would buy again.
5,I got this as a gift for my dad who is always losing his phone under car seats and this has fixed that! Though i did add an orange sticker on it to remind him to actually use it!
5,I had purchased this for my work car and it was easy to put in and works great no complaints
5,This product has been great so far! I'd say it works better than most other car phone mounts. Highly recommend if you're looking for a new one and it's a great price considering how good the product is.
5,This car mount is like a dream. Holds steady in the vent. Holds the phone great. The swivel feature allows for customized positioning. Easy in easy out.I’ve had it for a month and still loving it.
5,I love this car mount. I love that it charges my phone. It’s easy to mount to the vent in my car. It tilts. Opens easy and closes easily. It was exactly what I was looking for.
3,the phone mount would have been 4 stars but I think a piece was missing because myphone is not sturdy in my truck that fits around the ball piece in the video that I saw.
5,Might just be my car (‘21 Honda Pilot) but the phone bounces when on rough roads.  Has never fallen out of the mount.
2,It has no suction cups which is why I did not answer that question. It moves around because it is difficult to tighten to the point that it does not slide around.
5,I had a magnetic mount before that wouldn't work with my case on but this mount works great with or without my case! I have a note 8 and it fits even though my phone is on the ln larger side.
5,I got this for my son for Christmas. He loves it and helps him stay hands free while he commutes to work. He said it was easy to install and it is reliable. I would recommend!!
2,I unfortunately did not realize the vents on the family car (Nissan Rogue Sport) are too small for this very large mount to sit flush. Check your vehicle before buying folks.I wish the specifications mentioned what was required as far as vent size so I could avoided buying this. I like the design but unfortunately this was a bad purchase for me.
2,Doesn’t stay in one position. Not easy set up directions
5,Bought this to replace my old pinch-style vent clipper mount.  So impressed by the stability and ease of use for this style that ended up buying two more for our other cars.
5,Been a great phone mount!Only downside is it clips on to an air vent so you can’t change direction of air once installed. But loved the easiness to use and the quality of it.
5,First phone mount that remains sturdy with my pop socket on. Love it
5,This phone mount is exactly what I was looking for. It's easy to install adjustable and I haven't had any issues with it moving from it's place. Absolutely recommend.
5,Really great product simple to use and very sturdy compare to others I have owned. It did take a few times to get the piece to lock on to the vent but once it did it works great. Highly recommend.
3,Not sturdy
5,Love the car phone mount ! Amazing product  took me a while to find a car mount that I liked and this car mount definitely surpassed my expectations. 100% recommend this product .
5,LOVE this product! This phone mount was an absolute necessity during my last road trip. I am blown away at the quality. HIGHLY recommend.
3,Hard to install. After a while it stopped holding the phone where I pointed it. Could be better
3,Not very sturdy. It stays in the vent but it wobbles quite a bit
5,Best one on here! I didn’t want the one that sticks to your dash and I’ve tried ones that go in your vent but none of them would stay but this is does!
5,Arrived on time. Easy to install and holds my phone tight. I can even plug my charger from the port to my phone while in the holder without any issues. Really secure fit.
5,Best phone mount. I’ve had a hard time finding a good one and this is by far my favorite one. Will definitely be purchasing again for a family member who needs one !
5,This was easy to take out of the box and start using right away-- it's just what I needed!  If you're looking for a simple car mount-- this is the one for you!
5,All good for a replacement - tightens well to vent - needs to be tightened good on two different knobs but does the job - and does not fall off ! (Which is great!)
5,Works well with out suburban. My husband loves it’s easy to use features. It’s quick and easy to install. Our phones don’t fall out of the grip. We have both an iPhone and android.
3,It’s easy to install I don’t like how it’s a little flimsy on the sides that hold the phone could be a little more sturdy.
5,Gave to wife for Christmas and wanted her to use before writing a review.Easy to install hold better than the clothes pin style. Push of button on back and phone is released.
5,Great product!
5,Installing was a little challenging because of the space behind the vents.  Once on works well. Hold the phone securely. Like the bottom support for phone and the release button.
5,Hold my phone with wallet  case easily.  I will be buying a second one for my husband.  Great gadget for the price!
5,Lo recomiendo es perfecto queda seguro el cell
2,Not something that can rely while driving. It not lock it in place. Not possible to swirl horizontally which make it most unusable.
5,This car phone mount feels sturdy and doesn't shake or move while driving. Easy to use and I love mounting through the air vents instead of using adhesive on my dashboard.
5,Easy to install and use what more could you want.
5,Sturdy reliable
2,It works good but once you install it to one says it’s hard to make it for another phone size.
5,I bought this for my daughter who is a new driver. This saves her from looking down to navigate on Google Maps or to answer a call. Works perfectly!
3,Could be better it’s not sturdy enough for me and it’s a little loose once you set your phone in it
2,It seems like it will do the job well enough; the price is right and appears to be sturdy and secure.  It was a little tricky to get the hook to catch but it eventually took. Main complaint is that some weird sticky glue-like substance came out upon expanding the arms; it was difficult to clean off of the item and my hands and a bit disconcerting. I hope it doesn't continue to come out every time the arms open and close.
5,very easy to use the hook secures it to the vent even with bigger phones and the grip for the phone is pretty strong. Can't say how durable it is just yet but it's thus far the best phone holder of its type I've used
2,Esta bien pero queda muy flácido y no importa cómo loAcomodes va cambiar de lugar
5,This product was easy to use and set up! I got it for my mother for Christmas and she loves it! Instructions are clear and simple! Fits different sized phones!
3,It's OK but a little awkward to adjust and keep positioned as you would like.
5,This phone car mount holds up the phone well easy to install and adjust and is compatible with many phones as well as being good for the price.
5,I broke my last phone mount recently so I tried this one I found on Amazon. It’s good quality easy to install and has worked well so far! I’d purchase again
5,Thank you this is exactly what I needed for my part time grubhub job.  Stas in place and very easy to take your phone on and off the mount.
5,Nothing

5,This car phone mount works as promised. It is adjustable for any phone and rotates easily. Also there is an adjustable hook that prevent it from falling down. No complaints!
5,Purchased the phone mount for my 17 year old daughter she was upset because her mount wouldn’t work with her pop socket but this one did the trick!
5,I like how this product holds its value. I've had it in my car using it everyday for 2 months and it's still holding sturdy!
5,The phone holder itself that grasps on the phone over a few uses the grip itself starts to loosen or “fade”. But overall it’s great! I strongly recommend it.

5,This item is amazing. Easy to use. Is secure great angles and I have used it in mutliple cars. Would recommend to anyone.

3,Does not fit all cars like a LIncoln mkc.

3,Gave as gifts. Seemed ok
5,Nice for hands free. I had a magnet style car mount before and the phone had to sit just right for it to hold during driving. This is extremely sturdy.
1,As an Uber Eats delivery driver I need a phone mount that supports the phone for easy visibility of driving instruction and also releases the phone easily frequently.This phone mount holds the phone fine  but after only 1 month of use pressing the release button no longer causes the arms to expand to release the phone unless I manually pull on the arms while holding the button.Worthless.
5,For how much it is it gets the job done better than most other products.
5,Easy to install moves around some but easy to take phone in and out.

5,Phone mount is easy to install and very sturdy once mounted tightly enough.
5,Works well  good value. Exactly what we were looking for.
2,When I first installed this onto my vent it was great. It held my phone in place and was great! That only lasted about a week before it started to fall down and wouldn't hold up my screen. It's hard to explain but the ball that helps rotate the screen view becomes loose and doesn't hold still so it faces down.
5,Product works well and came as advertised. It does it's job!

5,Easy to install and super study
1,This doesn't work on my 2021 Ford Explorer  the little hook that moves forward to grab the vent is too shallow it doesn't hook onto the vent. Very disappointing  because otherwise it seems like a sturdy device and easy to get phone in and out. Had to send back.
5,Easy to install and stays put.
5,Got it for my son and he says it works great.

5,Perfect fit  easy to install.
5,it was very easy to instal and works very well.
5,this did the job!
2,I loved this when I first put it in my car.  It made it so easy to see MAPS while driving.  However there is no way to secure it so that it does not slide or fall out.  The long extension that f=goes in to the vent just slides in (and consequently slides out).My phone stays secure - even with a case - so that part is good.Disappointed - will be looking for another
5,More stable than others I have tried.
5,Product meets my iPhone needs. Easy installation. Great price!
5,It’s compact and stable
5,Sturdy as helllll
5,Worked exactly like I needed it to for my trip to St. Louis
5,Best car phone holder for vehicles with vent A/C. Easy to install. Sturdy stays in place. Impressed.
5,As described works good.
5,Que es muy efectivo
1,Purchased this product in May and it is already broken. The side clamp arms which are meant to hold the phone onto the mount no longer lock which means that my phone cannot be secured onto the mount. Appears as if the release button is stuck and has no intent in becoming unstuck which means this phone mount is now useless. Unfortunately there is only a 30 day return on this which means I’m stuck with it. Ugh…
5,Easy to set up and works great!
5,Easy to install
5,Overall 10/10 product great features and awesome experience
5,Works perfect
5,Works perfect
2,The sides barely open wide enough for my iPhone 12. It said it could be used with a pop socket on the phone but that isn’t the case. My phone barely stays in it.
5,Works great
5,It was very easy to set up
5,Nice product!
5,Great product
5,Very easy to use. Arrived quickly.

5,Great quality for the price
5,I needed this
2,Difficult to install. Very unstable
2,Easy to install if the vents are open the right way other wise the holder will not be locked in place.
5,like it
5,Awesome
5,Love it
5,Great phone mount.
1,I had the most frustrating experience trying to install this. The hardware would not grip my vent no matter how many different ways I tried to do it. After honestly probably 30 different tries I finally got it to stay but two days later the front part of the clip broke when I tried to adjust my phone in it. This was a waste of my money and energy.
2,Unfortunately the holder bar attaching to the vent is very thin. This item is not very stable and constantly flops around right to left. Also the phone attachment doesn’t hold my phone very well.
2,The part that is supposed to attach to the car vent is shaped in an odd way. It is almost impossible to get it to stay on the vent and I regret buying it.
5,I loved everything about this car mount!
2,Use only for smaller phones. My phone dropped 2 times in 1st 10 minutes
2,This only works with cars that have vent fins that are flush with the contour of the dash. If you have a Lexus ES 350 that has recessed vents then this barely hooks onto the horizontal fin and it sways back and forth because it barely attaches. So be wary of your vent style before ordering
1,I couldn’t figure how to make it stay. The phone just kept falling.
2,Does not hold on my vent very well
1,Would not say put in my LexusReturned
1,This is awful! it does not tighten down tried on all my vents! Regret this purchase!
1,i dislike this product because it was broken before i even opened it
2,Doesn't work for my 2017 pacifica.  But seems like a nice holder . My galaxy 21s plus fit perfect fit.
1,Didn't work well ...Not sturdy
1,I like the fact that my oversized phone would fit into the bracket. However I cannot get it installed in the air vent in my vehicle. Therefore it is useless to me.
2,Didn't secure very well to the vents
2,Clips ok great but the actual place where you put your phone is very "deep". My iPhone flops around the whole time and falls out easily. Sending back.
2,This was marketed as a universal mount. Unfortunately it did work with my 2018 Subaru Impreza. The hook that is supposed to catch on the air vent is way too small.
1,This item was covered in a sticky glue when it came. I cleaned it as well as I could but the sticky glue was coming from somewhere inside. It is tricky to mount it and not sturdy. Despite the stickiness it’s not a good product for me. It doesn’t hold the phone steady as the grip is not very strong or secure.
1,Broke one of my air vent. It didn't fit at all.  Now I have air vent broken and can't control the direction of the air at all. Also my Samsung phone doesn't stay stable cuz length of slot is short. I wouldn't recommend.
1,Tried to put on my vent in car wouldn't hold. Tried adding a credit card as a holder that didn't work.
2,It didn’t fit my cars vent. It kept moving and just wasn’t sturdy. Very disappointing.
1,Too loose
1,Works well
1,This seemed like a good phone mount at first-easy to install not too bulky and held my phone in place but it did not last long. After only one month of use it no longer works. The rubber grip inside the clamp part that held the mount onto the car vent was only attached to the inside of the clamp like a sticker. It quickly lost it’s stickiness and fell off the clamp making this phone holder useless.
1,It doesn’t lock good. Shakes as you drive
1,No tiene buen soporte al carro se safa muy
1,UPDATE *** While I stand by my review I'd like to add the speed and ease the seller replaced my faulty holder. I will not hesitate to by from this seller.I drive a semi and this mount has not fallen off the vent BUT the arms that hold the phone most of the time does not ratchet shut. Good design but junk product.
1,It's loose even when I tightened it up so I smashed it to pieces piece of junk
2,Poor disappointment
1,I used this for only a week before the entire piece broke off the stabilizer piece. Nothing even happened for it to break off. i place my phone on it and it was broken. I cannot get a hold of them either to receive a refund or a brand new one. Very disappointed.
1,Broke one of my vents first of all. The phone mount is sturdy and heavy but the part that is supposed to clip on and lock on to your vent is complete junk. It does not hold and my phone toppled out with the whole assembly multiple times. If your vents have a slope to their shape this won’t work at all. I plan to return. huge disappointment
1,I have had other phone mounts and had no issues with them attaching to my vent.  This one... would not attach at all!!!!Not user friendly
1,Easy to install and seemed like it would work but as soon as I put the phone in it the entire holder fell. The weight of the phone was too much for the holder. I have an iPhone pro 13.
1,I do not recommend this product. I am very disappointed of my money wasted on this product as I thought it was going to be sturdy and keeps it in placed on the contrary it does NOT hold my phone in place as advertised. Very disappointed.
1,Tried to mount it on 3 different vehicles and it would no tighten properly to hold mount.
1,It lasted literally half a day before the ratcheting mechanism that holds the phone in place stopped working.
1,Doesn't work with verticle vents in my GMC Sierra.
1,This product does not at all latch onto the vent as advertised and as a result not stable at all.
1,It doesn't connect properly to the air ducts and thus flops around wildly.  Going back to Amazon for one that is sturdier
1,it gets loose every time the phone gets put in or taken out it is difficult to tighten up on the vents. Looking for a different one now.
1,It moved and never got back to the original set. It shifts a lot waist off money
1,No matter what I'm doing I can't get this to stay in my vent. I've tried it all sorts of ways I can get in and it catches the vent but once any pressure is on it it pops right off.
1,Doesn’t fit in my vents- only works if vents are very narrow.
1,Dont buy this. Doesnt work
1,I would have liked this more if it was sturdy. It was easy to put together however my phone would just fall down each time. I ordered one from somewhere else.
1,I try to install it on my 2020 Honda Civic and it won’t stay in it
1,It’s no good
1,Not stable constantly having to turn it the right
1,Even though my phone is lite weight the phone mount would fall down and not support it in place.
1,Do Not Buy!!!!!!!!!! Was broke in box! I bought two of these items as a Christmas present and they were broke! Cheap!
1,It would not fit my car vent. No use what so ever
1,I ended up returning it because it was not sturdy at all it moves around alot with my phone in it.
1,It will not hook onto my vent
1,Tried using it to mount my phone in car. Would not stay up!!
1,It is not easy to install with some cars or trucks. I could not use it on my truck. I bought a different one.
1,It is not steady keeps slipping
1,Sags and can not see screen. flops down.
1,Wobbly
5,Very sturdy and easy to fit my phone but not good fit for vents on either of my 11 year old Subarus — vent angle off but it made a great gift for my sister’s Ford🥰! The price and product are great and it’s impossible to make anything universal even USB’s and that does drive me crazy. In short give it a try. If it doesn’t work it will work for friend family neighbor and make the roads safer for us all!
1,Flimsy product to support large iPhone 11 -terrible choice
1,The mount is suppose to fit all car models. However it didn’t fit my Toyota RAV4
5,This is such a great phone mount for my use case… it slides into the vents and works perfectly because I don’t have room to stick things on the dash!
5,My phone drags the mount down.  I had to put it in the vent on the left of my steering wheel.
5,Outstanding product
3,Easy to install but the phone feels like it will fall out easily
4,- For the price of this it’s definitely worth it. Holds my phone well.
5,Easy installation and holds my iPhone great with no issues
1,The screw lock that locks into the air vents will no longer unscrew to where I can connect it to another air vent. I’ve been very careful with it and it has not been abused. Just decided to stop working after 3 months. Won’t let me return it or exchange for a new one. DO NOT BUY.
5,I bought a cheaper version and regretted it. I bought this one and have been happier.
4,Great buy.  Came loose the first time but tightened up again and has been great since.
5,Love
5,So tired of seeing my husband looking down at his phone while using Maps app. I should have ordered this long ago. So easy to install secure and most importantly much safer.
5,works really well when on the go and is very affordable and sturdy.
5,Love the suction power and it is very easy to use
5,Item comes as shown. Easy to use. Great to be hands free and not looking down.
5,Very easy to use and quick to take off or put back on
5,I am enjoying my phone holder and have no complaints.
5,Pretty easy to install
5,Great easy to install!
5,I've had this thing for a few months it's held up pretty well. I do some minor-moderate truck trails in my hatch and it stays put and stayed put when my car turned into the Indiana Jones ride after a pothole damaged one of my struts. I use a Google pixel 5 fits fine n dandy.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Great little mount easy to install and to put phone in defiantly a great buy
5,Holds our iphone pro and pro max easily. There is a little release button at the back which makes it more easy to use.
5,A little difficult to position and tighten but when done it is very stable.
5,The Phone Mount was super easy to use. It was simple and direct which makes it easy to control and set up quickly. I figured it out within the first 2 minutes after opening the package. I have been using the phone mount for a week now it was stable and consistent. I used other ones before they are more expensive and is not stable. When I turn or when I went over a rock the phone mount would shake with the car.
5,I love this so much I bought two. It was so easy to install. It's fits very tight and holds in place. It's so nice to have my phone at eye level for when I need it. The little arms hug my phone so it's secure and doesn't become a projectile.
5,I love this product! I drive a smaller SUV and I absolutely love how it fits! Its so easy to install and has a super nice look to it! Its My phone is a iPhone 11 Pro Max with a case and pop it on it and it still fits nicely in the holder! Its adjustable to multiple phone sizes.
5,Was skeptical for this mount. Just about every vent mount I’ve used has been a disappointment. This one how ever is great for the large phones and the smaller phones. I use an iPhone 13 mini. My wife has a pro who ever is driving can put the phone in and it’s easy to adjust for either size.  Just push down on the bottom to extend or push up. Put phone in squeeze sides and phone stays put. Button on back to open makes it very pleasing.
5,Easy to install!
5,This one worth for the money. Works very well even with big phones. Good quality material with easy to use and install with air conditioner vent.
5,This is the Perfect phone mount. My phone fits securely in the mount and does not bounce around when a bump in the road is hit. I will purchase another for my other vehicle as well. this is a must have!!
5,For my 2018 Mazda CX-5. Fits well onto vent slat.
5,Better than expected
5,Bought it for my daughter; she has a pop socket on her phone case and works really well with it
5,Fácil de instalar
5,This was super easy to install allows me to turn my phone does not wiggle or make noise. Every now and then I have to tighten the back to keep the mount pointing in the right direction but it’s no big deal.
5,Excelente calidad fácil de instalar estable se ajusta bastante bien a mi teléfono y lo raya.Recomendado.
5,Very easy to install. Very sturdy and not wobbly compared to similar products. I highly recommend this mount.
5,This was a great purchase. It’s sturdy and you can tilt it to have your phone sit horizontally. Great investment for Uber/Lyft drivers.
5,I like it’s sturdiness.
2,Not match for my car
5,It was really easy to install and didn't look to big. It  went I'm easy and stayed in really easy. 😌  My phone fit perfectly and it worked in all my vehicles and for multiple phones. And hardly moved when I I hit a bumb I would definitely recommend this to my friends or even strangers! I have tried alot of phone holders for the car and this is by far my favorite! 😊
1,I've tried it in my Nissan Versa and my Dodge Durango.  Neither is a good fit.  The holder just wobbles around not secure even a little bit.  I won't be using this b/c who wants their phone to fall out of the holder in the middle of a drive?
5,It was very easy to install and phone is securely held.  I would recommend this product.
5,The holder arrived on-time. It is really easy to install and adjust when I didn't like where I installed it the first time. It's holds my  TCL 5G very well and I can put it into the holder and take it out quickly and easily.

5,Seems like a durable product. Makes it a lot easier having phone near eye level while trying to navigate.
5,It's an okay product. It holds my phone well even with the case on. It does move a little while I drive but it's minimal. It's very useful.
5,It is very easy to install and my cellphone is secure to manage with this base.
5,Fácil de instalar estable al colocarlo suele aflojarse cuando el vehículo va en marcha
5,Perfect for my phone. Stability could be impacted by car vent design.
4,Worked fine.  A bit awkward to get it tight to the vent
5,I really like this phone holder its perfect for my ford escape!  Its also holds the phone tight n stays in place.
5,It was easy to install and very sturdy and well-made. In fact I just purchased another one!
5,Absolutely 💯 % perfectly made for all cellphone I have bought more than ten all garbage. But this surpasses all understanding well made. Price is fair and it won't fall it won't fail believe it! 5 🌟
5,This is a perfect product because it’s a safety product when it comes to driving you have a high-level product. This mount is safer while driving because you can simultaneously look straight ahead and still be able to look at your phone which it has a GPS on it I recommend this product to anybody that would like to stay a safe driver.
5,Its really easy to use and set up. Fit my car perfect. Instructions were simple and works great.
5,This is a very well made and sturdy product that feels very high quality. It functions as intended.
5,Holds on to the vent well and leaves no marks. It grabs phone quickly and holds it well.
4,Easy to install may not fit some cards.
4,Super easy to install. The price is on point too. Great product for the price.
5,I’ve had a lot of these but this one is so sturdy and easy to use. It doesn’t flip over like most do. I highly recommend this! A+ for me.
5,This phone mount is amazing. It adjusts to every type of phone even if it has a big case. It holds your phone firmly in place and its securely mounted to the vents with no fear that it will fall off.
5,I have this mount in my car and recently bought the same one for my mum (who loves it). I've tried multiple car phone mounts with little to no success. Majority have a suction system that never works for me. But this one stays put and holds my phone in place
3,So far so good.  Very easy to get installed.
4,Si está bien
5,Works great hold my phone with no issues.
5,It holds my phone up in place without falling out. It was really nice and easy to install.
5,My mom had been complaining  that her old phone mount kept falling off and was bad quality. It got so bad that she decided to just go without one. I got her this one for Christmas and she loved it! It was so easy to install I had it setup and ready too go in under a minute. Plus her phone never falls off now and she can use it for easy navigation. I definitely recommend this product.
4,Clips in easy very secure and can move my iPhone pro max without it slacking from being too heavy. The only thing that’s a bummer is that it doesn’t hold the phone snug. While driving it will wobble in the mount. The raised lips keep it from falling out but it’s just not as stable as I was hoping. Great for the price!
5,Easy to install very sturdy and easy to use!
5,Very easy to install I wanted to be able to see while driving  love this so much
5,This is exactly what I wanted to hold my phone instead of keeping it in my hand while using GPS. Thank you
5,Every vent mount holder I've had used a pinch clamp. If I hit a bump it would fall off and take my phone with it.  Found this mounting system and it is rock solid.  My Samsung S21 with Poetic case fits great and goes in and out easily.  Very pleased with this mount and would recommend it.
5,Can’t adjust my vent as well though.
5,Been using this for a month now and its working great!
5,Works great.
5,I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this car mount. It has been so hard to find a good one but luckily I came across this one. Very easily to install and it holds my phone so well. It’s actually very sturdy.. it will definitely not disappoint you!!!!!
5,Easy to install! I love that it’s compact.
5,Pretty easy to use and install just a little tricky to put the phone in the car mount overall love the product
5,Easy to install keeps my phone in place and not sliding all over the car. Therefore making it a safer drive.
5,Only was little difficult to get in due to the back vents. Once in is sturdy but can not move louvers.
5,Easy to use and does the job. I noted 'positive suction' but it actually attached via simple clamps that attach to the vent opening. The only problem is that it does redirect the air flow a bit.
5,This product works well.  My spouse and I have phones of very different sizes and it fits them both well.  It's nice that there's a button release on top.  It holds onto the air vent securely.  Nice product
4,Phone mount holds phone exactly where I need it. I drive a lot for work and this holds my phone where I can make calls and use GPS easily and without worries!
5,I have gone through multiple phone mounts and every one was flimsy and it would shake and bounce at every little bump. This one once mounted properly on the vent is very stable. It only fell off once (though was from my poor installation) but once I got it properly clipped to the vent blade it hasn't fell off or even bumped around once. My phone is very stable and steady in this mount I highly recommend buying this phone mount!
5,After purchasing a very cheap phone holder that did not work at all - my phone kept falling down with the holder ALL the time - it was about time to buy a more sturdy phone holder. This one hits the mark!It's easy to install and also it's easy to place/remove the phone from the holder.This one should last for a while now!I would recommend this phone holder.
5,My phone and case are pretty heavy and this mount has been holding up so well. I wanted to wait a few weeks before reviewing so I can give a proper one.It does take a few minutes to get it connected onto the vent had a few trial and error moments lolbut once I got it good...it's holding up so well!It doesn't move when I make turns and for the most part stays in the same spot. (Again my stuff is kind of heavy so it slowly might move downwards but it isn't a major issue.)All in all definitely happy with this.
4,Works better than most I've had.
5,Easy to install and works well. Holds different sized phones.
5,Bought for Christmas present for my finacecs d he loves it! So nice!
5,Holds my phone samsung galaxy s21 well which has an extra card holding pocket as well as a popsocket on the back.
5,Rolled end over end and this will stick. I think if you drove about 75 miles an hour took a short corner and rolled your car about two or three times and over end even this thing would still stick here windshield and I’ll bet your phone would be just fine
5,Easy to assemble and also easy to attach my iPhone 12 Pro Max (plus) which is a big convenience for me since I like to take it out of the holder often.Would definitely recommend!
5,I previously had a magnet mount that worked great for quite a while but recently broke. I chose this one to replace it because I don’t have to have the ugly magnet on my phone. I was a little worried about it holding my heavy phone but it holds it in place no problem! I’m very pleased with my purchase!
5,easy to install solid grip
5,Easy to install very practical and out of the way for driving love it!
5,I bought this to use in another car while I was out of state. it held my phone well for using gps. I gave it to my son for an older car of his to use. lot safer then holding or looking at your phone all the time.
4,This is a very well-designed and constructed but the hook to fit onto the air vent is just a little too short so it won't work for me. Good value for the money IMHO
2,Ya sé daño lo use una semana. Casi no tiene agarre se mueve con facilidad.
5,I love this product.  It was easy to install and it is really sturdy.
5,Easy to install and it's sturdy and maneuverable.
5,Sturdy easy to install works great for maps.Hand free.
4,Just got it today installed it immediately in my wife's 2020 Chevy Spark and it fit like a champ. My wife says she doesn't really need  it but give it two days and she will use it all the time.
5,This is a non-suction phone holder that clips into the dashboard air vent.  The phone is supported by a bottom ledge and hugged in place by two spring loaded adjustable clips.  The device will maintain a horizontal or vertical position.  I use it for navigation and unlike those that sit in the cup holder it keeps the phone at eye level.  It does lessen the ability to adjust vent direction but does not occlude air intake.  I am quite satisfied with this gadget.
5,Love it and the convenience is great!
5,Simply perfect
5,I’m not sure why people had trouble installing this. I’m a small female who installed it with a coffee in one hand and the device in the other. Fit perfectly into the air vent of an F150. Love that I can charge my phone whilst it’s in the holder.
5,I love how sturdy this is and I put all my trust in it to hold my phone up. I love this and would definitely recommend it!
4,Do what it do
5,This works so well in my car. In fact I bought another one for my friend. It’s very easy to install in any car. Highly recommended!
5,I like that it's not bulkyit looks like a phone floating.
4,Product is great!  The clip that inserts into the vent was a little bigger than the slots in my vent were so it took some maneuvering of the vent angle to get it in correctly. Once it’s in though it’s sturdy and stable. Phone doesn’t bounce around and is easy to adjust. Stays in place which is great. No finicking with it once it’s in there it’s good to go.
5,This phone mount is sturdy and holds the phone at whatever angle best suits the user.  So satisfied with the first one I bought I bought a second for our other car.
5,I've gone through about 5 phone holders for my Android phone and got one for my friend as well. We have two different sizes and this one was the only one that would fit both. It handles sharp turns greatly and hasn't budged or become loose since I installed it. Great for any phone and grips well
4,Absolutely love it
5,excellent device ... I tried many but this is definitely the best excellent quality very good because it stands firm great design I tried it on my two cars and it is very good Kia Forte and Haval H6. excellent buy
5,Easy to install
5,Perfect
5,My son’s car is small and doesn’t have a lot of vents. We didn’t want to block the air flow and this phone mount works well for our purposes. It seems sturdy and secure and is easy to use. Would recommend!
5,I bought one for my car first because I work on social media and it’s easier to have my phone on it if I’m recording a video instead of holding it with my hand.Now I bought another one for my husbands car because he loved so much that He wanted one for his car.
5,Great for the price works well with my big heavy phone
5,Bought this for my wife. It looks great and holds her phone perfectly without any movement.
5,Very sturdy easy to install works perfect
5,Got it for my mother(Whos Older) and she loves how easy it has been to use and holds up her phone compared to other products
5,After reading all of the reviews I decided on this for my new IPhone SE.  I have round air vents with horizontal slats.  Someone reviewed that it would not accommodate round air vents but after juggling with it I got it to hold.  It's a tiny bit wobbly but overall I'm pleased with it - the price was right.
5,So easy to install and an amazing well thought out design to ensure sturdiness. Don’t have to worry about the phone falling. Highly recommended.
5,This phone mount is fantastic.  I purchased this before for my car and my husband kept on taking it out to put it into his car.  I finally ordered him his own.  We really like this car mount and would recommend it for the price point.  It works great and we both love it.
5,I have gone througj a lot of car and vent mounts and this one is the best!! Doesn't move at all when you're driving and stays in place.
2,I am certain it's better than the last one that I got
5,Easy to clip into a vent. Easy to drop phone into it. Easy to remove. Why didn’t I do this sooner???
4,Easy to use...great value and helpful when operating car !
5,Makes it much safer to drive especially in a non-Bluetooth car. Very sturdy.
5,Great product. I bought this because a friend had it and raved about it. It has not disappointed and I am glad to have purchased it.
5,I am happy
4,Looks like it would work GREAT in any other car but my vents are too long...it just doesn't work with this style
5,I love the ease of use of the phone Mount. It’s great to have when one is driving to talk on the phone with. One of the best car mounts that’s been made. Will definitely recommend to others.
5,Love this product it’s definitely a game changer. As someone who just moved to a new city and constantly using Apple Maps it’s nice to no longer be looking down at the directions! Makes your trip a lot safer regardless if you are using Apple Maps or just need to skip a song on your phone everybody needs this.
5,Easy to take in and out.
5,My girlfriend needed a car phone mount and this one came through! Very good quality and easy to set up and use!
5,Easy to use
5,Amazing gadget that does not keep falling off like most do. Easy to assemble easy to install. So happy with first purchase that added a second one. Price is excellent for such high quality! DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!
5,Phone mount was easy to install and is very sturdy. It hold my iPhone MaxPro perfectly and securely. Definitely worth the money!
5,Phone holder is easy to install it’s a great little holder fit my phone perfect.
5,It's works very well for now. Let's give it time to see if it changes.
5,the clip hooks to vent so the mount doesn't slip off.  holds my phone securely and has a easy release button
5,Used this product in my new car it is great. It is very easy to install and doesn’t look cheap in my car. Its also very sturdy and comes with easy instructions to set up.
5,It’s just what i was looking for without paying alot. It looks styling and stands out.
5,Very comfortable easy toInstall and fits my phone perfectly 💪
5,Easy to install and fits my phone perfectly.
5,I like it cuz is easy to use and install
5,Easy to install & it is so much better than the previous one that I purchased which just broke into pieces. The old one just went into the vent & tightened it but you could pull it out of the vent without loosening it.This new one has a hook that grabs the inside of the vent & then you tighten the ring around the plate & it will never fall off the vent. When I pull on it it is very secure. I have a Chevy Trax & this works perfect! Can be used vertically or horizontally & is stable when driving. There is a removable sticker that illustrates where it extends down for larger phones. Highly recommend it!
5,This phone holder has a sleek look and it does not fall or get displaced like other phone holders I’ve had in the past. It stays sturdy on the vent as long as you lock it onto the first vent fin. It has a nice release function in the back that you must press to let the arms open and you can remove your phone. Very sturdy and it will stay in place. Good product.
5,This phone holder is good. It took a few minutes to figure out how to put the round part into the back of the holder. It does well except for my car's vent that moves on its own when I go around curves. Lol
