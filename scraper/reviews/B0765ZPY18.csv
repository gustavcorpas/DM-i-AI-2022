4,My network has multiple switches and I tried 10G (NBASE-T) switches from different vendors.  This was the one that I settled on after trying the other consumer-priced 10G switches.  I am now using two of them on different floors.  They're completely plug-and-play no user interface to have to mess with.  Take out a gig-E switch and put in this one bam.  (This upgrades the connection among the computers on your local network like between your desktop and your file server.  It won't speed up your connection to the global Internet.  On any machine where you want faster-than-1G speed you will also have to upgrade its network interface card.  On existing 1G machines they just continue to work.)I took off one star because one of the two I am using is noisy -- either the fan needed replacing from Day 1 or something else is making rattly noise inside it.  The second one is completely silent even under load.
5,Full 10Gb between my NAS and Main computer. I uplinked the switch with gigabit back to the router (the faster a RT-AX88U will connect at). Hopefully around the time WIFI 7 is released more routers will have multigig ports at a more reasonable price and assuming at that time I get MultiGig internet I will upgrade the routers and have more ports open for other computers to connect with. I am using a used Server Intel X540-T1 network card and it worked right out of the box no problems with this switch. I am using a 6x8TB RAIDZ1 setup up for my NAS and coming straight off of the Hard Drives it bounced around 5-7 GBs The screen shot is a filed loaded into RAM and transferred not really what I am going to get in real world performance. The OpenSpeedTest server running on my NAS shows the speed just below 10Gb however I don't think the program is really optimized for that speed.It would be nice if the switch was about $300 less.It wont make you internet faster if the ISP is giving you less then 1GIG.
4,I purchased two of these to expand my network and get my 2Gbps internet to my gaming PC with a 10gbps port. These switches work great required no setup other than plugging in the cords and speeds are as advertised on the ports. Very happy with these devices!
3,As much as this is the only choice at this price range that gives the option for 2.5G5G & 10G in the same router there is no other router from any other brand that gives this flexibility in a single router.However the tech is so outdated IMO that it was not able to provide full 1G connection on it's 1G ports for a cable that is not even longer than 30M. I had another router and it was able to connect perfectly fine.Same thing happened when I tried connecting 2 2.5G ports from my NAS where it failed to provide connectivity to both the ports and was connecting to only one of them with Cat 8 cables. It worked with 1 cat8 and 2nd cat6 cable which I have no idea why but it couldn't connect to both the ports when using cat 8 cables which were not even more than 2 feet long as my NAS was sitting right under it. Connecting the NAS to the 5G ports worked perfectly fine and so was that ~30m 1G cable from the gateway when connected to the 2.5G port.After exchanging multiple emails and pictures going through iperf testing I got frustrated and decided to return and purchased another router.It might work for others but was a no go for me.
4,Pros: Works as advertised. Plus comes with a lifetime warranty.Cons: Gets very hot. This is the hottest switch I've ever owned. I have a 5 port 2.5Gbe Unmanaged switch which stays much cooler than this one. The side with the 10Gbe ports gets very hot. I actually have a small case fan pointed at the switch. It's under a desk so I was able to do that. I don't know if it's fine and all within normal operating spec.
5,Does as advertised who could ask for more?
5,Super fast switch.  I have my Aurora R13 with a OWC 10Gnic connected to this switch.  From there the switch connects to my Asus AXE16000 Router via 10G on both ends.  Then from there currently out the other 10Gbps port on the AXE160000 to a 2.5Gbps port on my Motorola MB8611 Docsis 3.1 Cable Modem.Fidium Fiber is in the process of being installed on my street now and from what other people in my town have said they install a Fiber ONT with a 10G out port.  Those that have 10G all the way from their ONT to PC have 4.5Gbps or better down and 1Gbps up on the 1Gbps Up/Down plan since Fidium  way over provisions the service.  Looking forward to getting Fiber once I am able to.  I am now ready thanks to this new Netgear XS508M Switch!
5,I needed a heavy duty very fast (200mbps+) switch in my garage to run high end video cameras this does the job with enough PoE power to run them all. I also put a smaller version in my office to run scanners and printers. Netgear makes the best high end (affordable high end) switches. I'm fixin to purchase their point to point system so I can send internet to my shop 80' away. I trust netgear stuff; both my routers are netgear and ALL my switches and extenders are also. Their tech support is wonderful.
5,Good network switch easy to setup and manage.
5,Since it has two multi-Gig ports I have it connected between my old Netgear xs716t 10Gb switch which does not support Multi-Gig and my new AT&T gateway which only support 1 2.5 and 5Gb this is much cheaper than replacing a 16Port 10Gb switch.
5,I’m lucky enough to have over-provisioned gigabit cable internet. In order to get my setup working to have multiple LAN devices access to use that bandwidth if necessary wasn’t able easy task.For a modem I needed a device that supported NBase-T on WAN but ALSO higher than 1Gbe on LAN. This left me 2 choices the ASUS RT AX89X or a really terrible QNAP option. Literally those 2.So ASUS was the choice. It has a 10G NBase-T Multigig RJ45 port as well as a 10G 10Base-T SFP+ port. Either can be used for LAN or WAN. Well since my Arris SB33 has a 2.5Gbe connection that was taken care of.Now I needed to find a switch that not only has a 10G SFP+ port but also has multiple NBase-T Multigig ports for my varying devices some have 10Gbe only cards some have 2.5Gbe only etc.Well this switch is honestly one of the best if not the best options available.Hooked up my router to the SFP+ with some twinax DACs I had as well as fiber OM3 and it worked perfectly with all of them (sticking with the fiber cause the DACs I had were too short but it worked perfectly with all of them). Had to do some extra setup to get it into my rack… all hardware is included for rack mounting just have to take the time to screw in 8 screws so it wasn’t bad at all. Speed wise I could not be happier. I have my devices connecting at 10Gbe 5Gbe or 2.5Gbe depending on the device no issues or questions asked. I have it inside a rack and honestly I have no idea if the fan has even turned on as it’s not loud enough to be heard over anything else I have.If anyone else were in a similar situation to me I would 100% recommend the XS508M any day of the week.Connectivity is great.Speeds are great.Easy installation.Haven’t had issues with any 10GTek modules or off-brand “any device” passive or active twinax DACs.All around happy camper.
3,I should have given up on POE++ and chosen something simpler.The Insite software wasn't good enough for my purpose and the manual user interface is overly complicated.
5,Work from home for a media company.  Main storage server is 144TB array.Needed to upgrade from plain gigabit  (too slow for the tasks needed)This is a really nice clear concise switch with some good VLAN capabilities.It's performance is 480 Gbps which is fully non-blocking FDX if all 24 ports were fully active.All main compute and storage machines (13 in total) are fully 10GbE nowHouse WiFi 2.5G.4x 1GbE downlink (trunked) for slower devices .Everything works without an issue now.Main storage array provides trunked 2x 10GbE to serve all compute nodes.If I need to expand  this is what I'll get as the 2nd switch.
4,So far so good with this switch. I did read the other reviews discussing the heat coming off the unit but I thought maybe they were exaggerating. Well not so much you could definitely cook bacon on this thing when the 10Gb ports are being utilized. But that's the trade-off for a silent switch with passive cooling. I did however buy a little fan to push air across the switch and that's helped considerably. I'd rather play it safe and potentially extend the life of the components inside.
3,maybe just bad luck got item and it had trouble connotating with internet. finally got it working not plug and play would work for about a day before losing signal. did this for 3 days then finally wouldnt connect at all. support said bad switch so sending it back. amazon doesnt have an exchange policy its only for refund so if you buy and get a faulty unit dont expect to get a new one fast
4,I've been a fan of Netgear products and I own a lot of their products over the course of years.  However this product is quite a bit of disappointment as it runs really hot.  So hot that it may burn your fingers if you touch the top of the case particularly right above the 2x 10G ports.  Everything else about this switch has been good.  So today I took matters into my own hands and opened up the switch.  To my big surprise the entire back side vents are blocked with a plastic inside the switch that has heat dissipation stuff on the top.  I opened up the switch and simply cut out only those few inches of plastic that were blocking the vents on the back and now the switch is still running pretty hot but not close to what it was.  This is a major oversight on Netgear's behalf!  The should've not blocked those vents and (at a minimum) should've more vents on the back.  Also I really think the switch needs a small fan with that much heat being generated inside.  I would appreciate if Netgear's support/customer service should offer me some help.
2,even to save small kittens this unit would not do a static installation for my initial install.  This is a latent firmware issue.  I finally got the unit working using the switch's DHCP (it is itself NOT a DHCP server) with moderate success.  The bad is it reassigned my network to strange all new IP address's.  It also assigned the switch internal web page to an equally strange address.  I had to search for this address.  Just seems clumsy for a semi professional product.NetGear tech support and they suggested it was my fault... NOT.  I question how stable the unit's firmware is for more advanced settings?  But for the very basic settings the switch is up and running.  The first day of operation the switch was kinda unstable.Netgear does NOT seem to have a matching fire wall box and i wonder if they will pass to pfSense?  There are a lot of fire wall / switch combo products out there.
5,I purchased this as a replacement for my connected home not business. It is a bit noisy but nothing to be concerned with just comparing it to my last unit which was silent.I purchased this to power my new wax630e APs and couldn't be happier. Set up was a breeze and intuitive. Probably easier than my connected home setup that was made by ruckus.
5,It works great. I always use Netgear. This is trusted brand and I am happy with all the products I have
2,I have a SFP 1GBaseT tranceiver.  When connected to the SFP port the switch hangs hard and refuses to do anything at all.  Now sure maybe that's a bad tranceiver.  But a NETWORK SWITCH needs to continue working no matter what garbage is connected.  The 4 twisted pair ports work fine and I won't be returning it but I'd never recommend this device to anyone else based on that experience.
5,One day we'll be able to buy a 48-port 10G switch without spending $3000.  But today for that money you just can't find a better 10G switch offering 48 ports and the kind of performance and features you will get from the Netgear XS748T.Most people buying this switch will be installing it in a cabinet or rackmount where noise is not too much of an issue.  But if you are considering it to be installed in an office environment be aware that it is pretty loud due to its 4 x 20mm fans.  (Too bad these switches don't have an optional water-cooling kit to make them quieter.)Even the fans on Neagear's lower-end 10G switches are pretty noisy.  If they can't water cool them maybe a different form factor such as 2u would be better in order to use bigger quieter fans?Like every other managed switch on the planet the UI is clunky and counter-intuitive.  But again like all other switches you learn the UI and then it's not so bad -- until you need to edit the configuration months later requiring you to figure out the whole thing again.Be sure you have good depth where you're installing the switch.  It's about the size of a pizza box.If you're price-shopping I have found the Amazon price to be a good amount better than other "eggy" website so scoop it up here.
5,This is a great option if you are deploying an 802.11ax Wireless Access Point (WAP). Being a business class switch the warranty is very good and I would say the over all quality is very good as well. There maybe some Quality Ontario Issues though. The switch I received from Amazon functioned correctly and I was able to set vLans and get everything working very quickly with my current Cisco Nexus gear. However I had an issue where the power LED was not illuminating which concerned me as there could be other issues. After registering the switch on Netgear’s site I submitted a support ticket which they quickly replied to. After going through their troubleshooting process I now have a replacement switch on the way to me at not cost to me; I will of course have to return the original switch as part of the RMA.Overall I am very happy with my purchase and how Netgear handled my support case.I would recommend to keep in mind that this is not a fully managed switch so you have to use the web interface to do any configuration. Also as a smart switch I wouldn’t recommend to a movie that does not understand the myriad setting that can be configured as this could be very confusing.
5,I was a bit concerned that the SFP+ port was only for uplinking but that's not the case. I can't compare it much for performance but it's not as fast as using an x299 board with four 10Gb PCI-E NIC Network Cards.
5,Nice switch.  Works as described.  I wanted to say medium value for the money but all electronics are more expensive now.  Still a lot cheaper than 5 years ago.
2,I switched my house over to 10GbE and bought this. Unfortunately when it is connected directly to the 2 GbE port from Google fiber I get 170 Mbps throughput (minus 2 stars for this).  A work around is to use a GS110MX in between.  If I go in and out the 10GbE ports of the GS110MX back to the XS508T iperf3 tests around ~9GbE both directions.  This is the only way I've figured out how to get full speeds.Minus two more stars because port two is almost unusable after a few hours of use.  It basically becomes one way communication.  It can RX at 10GbE but TX drops below 100Mbps.  If you cycle the power it works fine for a while.Plus one star for customer service.  Chat support is great. Phone support is great.  E-mail support is a little delayed but still great.  Unfortunately the product just doesn't work as expected.I purchased 3 of these they all have the exact same problems.  I am currently working with Netgear customer service and was advised my case has been escalated to their engineering team.  I will provide updates when/if I hear back from them.FYI - I also purchased an XS708T but it causes the 2GbE Google Fiber Wi-Fi to crash as soon as it's connected.  I spent several hours troubleshooting it with the customer service but they were unable to resolve it.  Following the customer service advice I returned the XS708T.
5,Like any switch but for more speed
5,Works like any other unmanaged switch. Doesn’t get hot and its throughout was measured as adequate and what I needed for my 1gig fiber plan.
3,So probably many of you are interesting in this switch to do VLANs one of the most common SOHO reasons to upgrade from unmanaged.  And at this price with 10GbE it's a bargain.  BUT... there's one problem.  The switch itself always listens on all VLANs and so is accessible from any VLAN via standard password.  And if someone can log into your switch they can access any other VLAN with ease.  In addition it asks for IP addresses across every VLAN if set to DHCP so it's rather random what subnet it may end up on.In Netgear's smart managed pro switches there is a "Management VLAN" assignment so you can put it on your most trusted network and not have it accessible from your public hotspot VLAN.  This switch doesn't have that apparently "by design" as a differentiator.  There are many other features added in the Smart Managed Pro line but this I think is something that is an integral part of implementing VLANs and so no excuse for not including.I also bought an MX510TX at the same time and it does everything needed and more but of course at extra cost (especially if the cost of an SFP module added in).On the positive side however it was otherwise easy to set up and despite what the specs say it connected at 10GbE over 50ft of Cat5e to the MX510TX no problem.  I can't fully load test it because I don't have any single device that will saturate it yet if I get one I'll update this.
1,This switch comes with 2 10Gb ethernet ports - which was perfect for my needs as both my file server and workstation have 10Gb ports; all my other network devices are 1Gb so this seemed to be exactly what I needed.I had been using a random collection of patch cables that I had accumulated over the years - a mix of cat5 cat5e and possibly cat6. To ensure that the cables would not be an issue I also bought new cat6 cables along with this switch. Once it arrived I got it all hooked up and performed a quick file transfer test (around 4GB) from my workstation to the file server - the transfer speeds definitely showed a significant improvement. The next day I tried playing a video file over the network from the file server - and immediately saw stuttering pauses of several seconds and image artifacts - which are indications that the video player is not getting the video data. This was not present on my old 1Gb switch. I even ordered new cat6a patch cables - same issue.I verified that both computers were showing 10Gb as their connection speed. I checked the switch and it was hot to the touch very uncomfortable to touch - almost burning. The switch was on its own self no ventilation holes obstructed plenty of empty space around. I switched from both 10Gb port to the 1Gb ports - immediately the temperature of the switch dropped (still very warm but able to help my hand on it comfortably). The issue with video playback over the network disappeared.My educated guess is that the lack of an active cooling solution is causing the chips to overheat when using the 10Gb ports which then results in dropped packets. When just transferring files this is not a huge issue as Window's SMB uses the TCP protocol which has builtin mechanisms for dealing with dropped packets; with the higher transfer speeds - even a relatively high amount of dropped packets will still give a higher throughput over 1Gb ports. This however is not true when either directly viewing or modifying a file; and will be especially true in viewing a video over the 10Gb ports. This is because say about 10% of packets needed for 60 frames (2 seconds) of video are dropped well the TCP protocol will request them again; however by the time they arrive - the video player will assemble what packets it already received display them (with artifacts or stuttering) and then move one to the next frames. When the replacement packets do arrive the player has already moved on from those frames.The conclusion - this is pretty much an overpriced 1Gb switch. The 10Gb ports just do not work as needed. They *may* be fine if you are using them to transfer files and not to directly view/modify the files. However I would urge caution even then as if the chips are getting hot enough to heat the metal case to "almost burning" and are dropping packets already - this does not give me confidence that they will last long. I am returning the one I bought.
5,Product is as described.  Arrived a day early for which I am thankful  The seller is awesome.
5,I recently upgraded my office network to10G Ethernet. Central to that effort is the switch - the NetGear 12-port 10G Switch to be exact.Configuration proved simple. I have ten devices connected to the switch: a Synology server and two computers using 10G the rest running at 1G. The switch handles multiple protocols with no problems. And transfer speeds are 3X to 10X faster than 1G depending upon the device I'm talking to.I would recommend this switch to anyone running a small network that needs more speed. So far there have been no problems with all the speed I expect.
5,It’s a bit in the expensive side but well worth it. Very nice that Amazon had a fiancee option. Very pleased with the performance was using a gigabit unit for years not one issue so far this one is no different. 2.5 and even 5gig speeds are fantastic let alone 10 for my needs with a home server and tons of media going from pc to the next. Also the tech support of great lifetime warranty on it. My old one was the same had bad fan got it replaced and some odd firmware issue was replaced.  I never usually have issues but it nice price of mind support is there if ever it goes south.  Please note use hi quality cable use solid core cable this device does not play nice with the cheap stuff not a fault of the device.
1,I purchased this 10 Gbps switch to be the backbone of my home network upgrade.  With my smart home having hundreds of devices multiple people streaming 4K video around the house a home Plex server multiple PCs accessing the server around the house I felt the old +15 year old switches were the bottleneck.  Not to mention that ports on those switches were beginning to fail.  So due to the price of this 10Gbps switch from Netgear and the price of other 10Gbps switches with 8 gigabit ports from QNAP (QSW-308-1C) and Netgear (GS110MX) it made sense to upgrade.I purchased this 5-port 10Gbps switch from Amazon and it was delivered on May 14th.  After receiving this switch I set up a temporary network with just this switch and two PCs with 10Gbps Ethernet cards to test this switch.  The switch powered on and recognized the 10Gb links but no data could be sent across the switch whether it were files through explorer or throughput tests such as the one by TamoSoft.  So this first unit went back to Amazon for exchange.I received my replacement unit on June 1st and I ran it through the same tests as the first unit.  The replacement would send data across this time but only at Gigabit speeds.  Yes I tested my pc cards through a direct link and had been using them in that configuration for a couple years.  I contacted Netgear and spoke to their support.  After running a few tests with their recommended throughput software he told me that this unit was bad and to send it back to Amazon.While waiting to receive my 3rd unit I received the two above mentioned switches each have at least 2x 10Gbps ports.  I ran the same tests on these two switches and they both worked flawlessly!  I was averaging 8500 Mbps throughput through each switch and even then linked to each other so no loss.On June 13 I received my third and final 5-port 10Gbps switch from Amazon.  This unit behaved like the first no data could be sent across.  So it went back and I ordered a second of the above mentioned QNAP switches.  I also tested this Netgear 5 port switch with a SPF+ connection in all my testing I have a couple PCs with Mellanox cards to no avail.  I did find that the switch wouldn’t boot  when powered on with an SFP+ adapter installed in its combo port.I can say that Amazon customer support was amazing through this whole process and that’s where the 5 stars for Tech Support is coming from.
5,A cost effective way to jump on the Multi-Gigabit wagon if you have 1Gb clients and Multi-Gig backend. Two ports out of the 10 are Multi-Gigabit up to 10G. I connected one to the router and got 2.5G right away on CAT5E and CAT6 mixed cabling which is my current max without any link aggregation. A true 10G 8-port switch would’ve cost at least 3 times more so this was a no-brainer until the technology becomes more accessible.Regarding the physical build it’s an all metal body fan-less switch with some bracket hardware included. It also comes with plastic feet in case you want to rest it horizontally on a desk. Power adapter socket is in the back and all Ethernet sockets are in the front. I just positioned it vertically on the back of my equipment cabinet and without any hardware attached it would tip over which means the weight is distributed evenly without any sides being heavier than the other. Overall it’s very well made. Thanks for reading and good luck with your decision.
5,I use this to have a 10 Gbps link across the house (to an un-managed GS110MX) and to do LAG (link aggregation/bonded link) to my NAS which only has 2 1-Gbps ports that can be bonded to 2 Gbps. It works great. No issues at all. Runs a little warm but not hot.The one area I am disappointed in is Netgear only supports http for the web user interface. They do not support https on the GS110EMX. Crazy. Seriously Netgear why not support a secure connection for web based configuration? Everyone else does. This only affects configuration and does not affect operation which is excellent and is why I can live with it but it is the one area that could be improved on to make this a perfect product.
3,I wanted a switch with PoE and getting a multi-gig capable model sounded like a good way to future proof my network. I kind of wish I'd gone with one of the many (much cheaper) gigabit ones out there instead. The switch works but WOW...This thing gets HOT!!! Seriously hot. Too-hot-to-touch-hot even while pushing less than 40 watts over PoE and with no network traffic to speak of.To be fair it's been running stable despite the heat and does what a switch is supposed to do. The web UI is a bit clunky and looks like an intern wrote it around the time myspace was the hot new thing but gets the job done.The unit ships with an expired HTTPS certificate which cannot be replaced with a self-signed one. There is a "generate certificate" feature which will re-generate a cert with the same expiration date in the past and an "import certificate" function which rejects any certificate including ones generated by the device itself! - Makes you wonder why Netgear even bothers with HTTPS at all.So overall no show-stoppers - but certainly not a flawless or polished product not energy efficient and the excessive heat buildup makes me question longevity.
4,It’s a good plug and play switch yet leaves a lot to be desired for management. Trying to access the switch’s interface required a Jumanji game with various documentation. The UI is overly complicated there’s no reason why VLAN configuration should require a guessing game of button mashing.
5,This is for the MS510TXPP model I have been a network engineer for over 20 years. I was not sure this little switch could deliver everything it claimed to do.. my main priority was to QoS traffic for my gaming rig. I was able to do this and more.  I tested QoS policies by marking a DSCP value and doing a packet capture on my Pfsense router and my dns cache server and I could confirm that the policies were tagging traffic correctly. once that was validated I then moved my critical (gaming) traffic to a strict priority queue!  I was able to test iperf3 and got full line rate speeds with QoS applied! amazing just amazing! I also used private vlan configuration to segment off my guest traffic and IOT devices which are dumped into a community vlan through the AP.  one thing I was disappointed in and hopefully netgear is reading this..  there is no DHCP relay capability today 12/22/2017 on the vlans... this makes it hard to deploy "routed" vlans which out having to add an additional DHCP server layer2 adjacent to any routed vlan... you can of course use static IPs... but I dont want to manage static IPs.. maybe this will be available in future software releases... overall this is an amazing switch and I am very happy with the features it provides.
5,The Netgear XS505M allows me to set up a small network using only unmanaged switches.  I had my remodel include Cat6A for home networking (4 rooms 2 access locations per room).  Combining this with 2 Netgear GS110MX for less than $700 I upgraded to a 10G network with 10G devices in 3 rooms. This is less than the cost of 1 of many 10G managed switches.  I need the XS505M because I have 3 10G devices in one of the rooms. Since the XS505M ports are multi-gig I can use 1 for my multi-port wireless access point (a Netgear R8500 router) and use it as a switch for 1G devices in the same room.  Because I want to use my network not play with it using unmanaged switches means I can spend less time on system management and more time using my system.
5,Very steady! easy to set upthe port is 12 which is less common!
5,Love it
5,Good: No problems in the two weeks it's been in operation as a mini-SAN backbone. Handles 9000-byte frames and mixed 1Gb and 10Gb without complaint. Excellent latency zero errors on any line since installation. Quiet relative to the other boxen in the stack anyway.Bad: For an unmanaged switch seems to take a long time (~ 30 sec.) to come online after power-up. Not an issue in normal operation of course. I couldn't get any action on the SFP+ port when I tried it but it passes loopback and ethernet port 8 works fine so I'm guessing I had a bad cable or NIC.Bottom line: Impressive capacity and performance at this price point. Downsides are nitpicks I'm happy with the unit. If you're in a SOHO environment that doesn't need smart-switch functionality this will work well. Five stars.
2,UPDATE (2/10/19):I decided to give this switch another round of evaluation to make certain it was my environment before purchasing a much more expensive 10GBE switch. After setting this switch up with the two 10G ports connected to different computers and one 1G port connected to my main switch in a temperature-controlled room with a room temperature sensor placed on the wall about 2 feet from the switch I left it running overnight. The room temperature never got above 80F but the switch became so hot that it was unresponsive by 6am and stayed that way until I disconnected it several hours later. Before stopping the experiment requests/connections to the switch and all of the devices connected directly to it were either timing out or taking over 60 seconds to respond.My conclusion is that these 10GBE ports run too hot for this small passively-cooled enclosure.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I have a NAS that I set up to record 24/7 video connected to a 10G port on this switch but there are hundreds of gaps in the timeline every day where the recordings cut out. After a week of this I plugged the NAS into a 1Gbps port in another switch and I have not had a single dropped second of video in days. The equipment is in a finished air conditioned attic but it does get to up to 95F in there during the day and this switch gets too hot to touch. So this may or may not be happening to others people with this switch but if it is they might not notice unless their 10G port is under constant load and/or in a warm room. It is my just be my fault for putting a switch in that environment that doesn't have active cooling. Before the switch ended up there it was used in a room I kept around 80F. I achieved amazing transfer speeds between the NAS and a PC with both connected to 10G ports on the switch.I am not giving it a low rating because it clearly states in the documentation that the operating temperature is 32-104F. So this is more of a warning for people looking for the cheapest/best 10G switch they can find. If you keep it nice and cool it works great.The image is the video recording timeline for the day I switched the NAS over to another switch I had in the same rack.  I changed switches just after 11am as you can see.
5,I currently have 2 of these.  Both work as expected.  Iperf test connected at 10GbE is actually ~9GbE both directions.  Autonegotiates to 2.5 GbE and 1GbE devices.  I don't have anything 5GbE so I can't comment on that.
4,Despite what is answered in the questions for this unit the supplied adapter is only 110V us plug. Adapter model is 332-10758-01 . You will need a appropriate adapter (voltage and plug) for other countries.
5,I bought a pair of these to run a 10G backbone between two locations over optical cable (SFP+). They've worked flawlessly since I installed them. Simple and effective. I've had no problem reaching saturation data rates between the two switches. 10G over copper is very convenient for connecting devices.Only nits: the XS505M is fairly bulky for its 5 ports and it does have a small (but audible) fan.
4,This is for the gs110mx switch.  Great switch.  I have two computers with 10gig cards and other devices with gigabit nics.  I also have a raspberry pi that operates lower.  All communicate well on the switch.  One caveat though.  It appears that the 10gig ports are very fussy.  I have 1 amazon basics cat 7 cable and when that cable is used with the 10gig ports connection is flawless.  For testing I used a cat5e cable and a no name cat 6 (that I doubt is actually cat 6) cable in the 10 gig ports and while the devices negociate 10 gig speeds the connection is very flakey.  When those cables are used in the 1 gig ports on the switch the connection negotiates at 1 gig but is wonderful and stable.  I highly recommend getting good cables for the the 10gig ports.  You will want them anyway but dont even bother with lesser cables in those two ports.
4,I cant believe that amazon placed a $175 switch in a BAG and shipped it to me like this.  It was pretty banged up by time it got to me.I will follow up if it powers up and works with an update.What really pisses me off is that Amazon has put $25 dollar "amazon plug" in a box with solid packing... and not this switch at 150% increase in value.  Really poor judgement on their part.
3,I had the 8 port unit connected to the 5 port unit for a while.  Then I replaced the 5 port with the Ubiquiti Flex XG.  The 8 port unit will only negotiate to 5Gbps connected to the Flex XG.  On a whim I connected the Netgear 5 port to the Flex XG and it negotiated fine on all ports.  Looks like the Netgear 8 port will be added to the pile of other half working Netgear networking equipment in my junk box....  At least there are a lot more vendors selling multi-gig network equipment these days.
1,What's the point of this switch if Jumbo Frames isn't supported?It's supposed to support 9k but it appears that mine needs to be RMA'd because the 5th digit in my serial number is a "7."My iperf3 test gives me 4.67 Gbits/secPing test on LAN gives:Pinging 192.168.1.167 with 9000 bytes of data:Packet needs to be fragmented but DF set.Packet needs to be fragmented but DF set.Packet needs to be fragmented but DF set.Packet needs to be fragmented but DF set.I spent 40 minutes on the phone with Netgear tech support and they treated me like I was incompetent. "Sir you cannot transfer 10GB (gigabytes) per second. It's 10Gb (gigabits) per second."I kept replying with "I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE! I'm not a noob. I would LOVE 10 gigabits per second. I'm calling because I'm only getting about 5 gigabits per second." A half hour of the conversation was ME trying to prove to them that I knew what I was talking about.I set the Jumbo Packet to 9014.Link speed from auto to 10G.Flow Control on to off and vice versaReceive and Transmit buffers to max.  (4096 + 8184)He responded with "Sir. What kind of cables are you using? It's possible that it's your cables.""Cat 7 ethernet and OM4 fiber. It's not the cables. Just RMA the switch! It's a known issue. Please look it up.""Okay sir we'll I'll request to escalate this for RMA approval."(WHAT?)Half hour later it gets approved for RMA. Such a headache.Good news is that they'll send another unit out "Next Business Day" and I just need to send this unit back after I've installed the replacement. It only took 4 NICS $200 worth of cables ~20 hours of trouble shooting and researching and 40 minutes on the phone arguing with their tech support and now an RMA replacement to FINALLY get what I was supposed to have paid for almost a year ago!I swear I'm never buying Netgear crap again.Note: I *might* edit this review once I've confirmed the replacement meets or exceeds my expectations.
3,Vlans do not seem to work on this switch though it will passthough vlans to other devices and managed switches _usually_ without issue.  More recently I noticed that my port aggregation was at the very least not displaying properly on the unifi switch nor was it displaying properly on the Netgear itself only listing g2 through g4 listed as current members despite being configured for g1 through g4.  Deleting the lag1 members applying then readding members and applying gets the aggregation displaying properly on both ends.  Shortly later the netgear stops passing traffic from the router.  Normal traffic was not restored until the netgear was rebooted and again only g2 through g4 are listed as active lag members and unifi claims similar.No vlan or port aggregation issues otherwise with the unifi core switch when used with cisco switches or HP switches.  However none of these used switches support multigig ethernet excepting for two ports on the unifi core.
3,One of the cheapest multiport 10GbE switches I could find on Amazon in May 2018 this one offered more 10GbE ports than the TP-Link JetStream T1700G-28TQ without requiring the additional purchase of SFP+ adapters and in a package 4 inches smaller lengthwise.  It looks modern under the desk.  However unlike the TP-Link this NetGear has a fan and it's not silent (although it is reasonably quiet).  When you might otherwise want silence in the room you can hear this unit a bit.  I tried the mod recommended by another reviewer - substituting the appropriately sized Noctua 40mm fan - but it was even louder in its default state.  When I tried adding in Noctua's included Low Noise Adapter the fan noise was quieter but after closing the shroud back up for the NetGear it made more of a wind-tunnel noise that was also louder than the stock fan.  So in the end I put the stock fan back in place and am busily scheming how to move this switch into a closet.One last annoying little tidbit:  I found that the file transfer speeds using this switch were some 10-15% slower than when using NetGear's own NightHawk 10GbE switch!  The only - but obvious - downside to the cheaper silent NightHawk switch is that it has only two 10GbE ports.  Even for a fairly average SOHO user such as myself that's not enough since I need to connect two servers to my office PC.  Oh well.
4,Solid switch thoroughly tested 2.5G 5G and 10G on the 10G side very happy with overall functionality. Marvell-based switch 88E6190X for the 1G ports and 2x 88X3310P for the 10G ports. PCB is clean only 1 electrolytic cap (power supply side) so it's likely to last forever.Why not 5 stars? The heatsink on top of the 10G chipsets was not seated properly it was merely hovering (kudos to Marvell their chip didn't turn to ashes despite the lack of proper cooling). Removed the stock thermal paste (was completely dry) replaced it with some Noctua NT-H2 and re-installed the heatsink properly. Disappointing quality control.Included some tech nudes if that's what you're into.
5,I am using the XS512EM (rack mounted) in a small office to network a MacPro 2019 (10G LAG) a MacMini M1 and several other 1G computers and NAS units via cat6 (within the office) to a Synology DS1821+ NAS (10G LAG) - it was easy to configure and works great! Outside connection to WAN is by 1G cat5. File transfers at 10G between the MacPro and Synology within my office are now about 8X faster than with previous 1G switch.
5,I have had one of these switches in my home theater room for a little over a year and can vouch it's a great switch. It is completely fanless and thus silent the way any switch for home use should be. No issues with Aquantia AQN-107 10 Gbps cards and works fine with 9 KB jumbo frames. It's unmanaged but works perfectly for my needs. I wish it had just a few more 10 Gbps ports.I just ordered one more for my master bedroom which also has an HTPC. Now just need to run new CAT6A or higher cable over there and one more NIC for it also.
5,Connections work out of the box. Two of these linked together even using CAT5e over a decent distance synced and passes 10G.  This allows all the 1G devices on each end to run full speed without lag or bottlenecks.  My setup has 10G direct to a server on one end leaves one 10G port for the next switch in the chain.  Out of the box settings are great but configuration to bond links and QOS are available via pretty decent web and app interfaces.  My latency is noticeably reduced.  Cant wait to see what NETGEAR brings to 10G networks next.
3,Only bought it based on price and that no other similar priced 2 port RJ45 10GB and 8 Port 1Gb capable switches are currently on the market. I have 2 major criticisms of the unit. Firstly the supplied plug pack is NOT a universal adapter but a region specific (100v-110v)  plug pack. Most every other supplier provide universal (100-240v) plug packs so that even if the power pins are wrong for your region you can still get an pin adapter. So international buyers beware. Secondly the unit runs SUPER HOT and I am almost tempted to try frying an egg on the chasis. This might be OK if you are rack mounting the switch but not for desktop use. I have had to add a notebook cooling fan pad under the switch to keep it running at an acceptable temperature. Over heating means too much power is being wasted and a higher chance of equipment failure which to me mean it has been poorly designed. I don't think I would buy it again if I had the choice.
5,Plugged one end into my NetGear NightHawk R9000  router and then plugged my 3 10GB NAS and PC into the switch.  Worked the first time. No issues.  Lights clearly showed I was connected at 10Gbits.  Testing speed over a 15 ft Cat 7 cable achieved speed of exactly 10Gbits/s which is the maximum.  Great stuff.  I saw the video on Linus tips and he spend a fortune on equipment and could only get 500Mbits/s over hist 10G network so I feel great!  Only issue is that it is not cheep at $300 but still the cheapest I could find with a reputable brand name.  Also mine is about 8 feet from my desk and I can't here it so noise is not an issue.  Highly recommended.
3,This switch is not good with video.  I had to reset TV Roku and switch because it would get stuck on video streaming.
5,I've been using two old enterprise 10Gb SFP network cards in my test server and media server that were connected directly to each other to allow me to place media on the test server then move it to the media server after I edited or prepared the files.  However in order to access my LAN I also had to have 1Gb ethernet network cards in each server connected to my gigabit switch.  With the new NETGEAR 10-Port Gigabit/10G Ethernet Switch I was able to uninstall all the network cards and just purchase one 10Gb ethernet card for each server and connect them to the 10Gb ports on the switch.  Now both servers communicate at gigabit speeds to the LAN and 10Gb speeds to each other.
4,I do a lot of copying on the network - this made it faster and easier. But do not expect perfection. About once a month it hiccups. All data through it stops. Unplug it. 10 seconds. Plug it back in. Back in the race. A minor annoyance for all the time it saves me.
5,I moved from a 7 year old Netgear 5 port Gigabit switch to this one and ran it with link aggregation on 2 x 1Gb ports and a 2.5Gb link to my MOCA network. Extremely fast low latency and everything just works.Only downside is that it runs very very warm. This unit uses natural cooling via the metal case (no fan) so it's extremely silent but it gets a little too warm for me. But otherwise it has been flawless.
5,Wish I could add this switch to Insight and it included POE++ ports.  (To be used for NETGEAR WAX630 AP's.)  Does support POE+ Multi Gig SFP+ 10GB and GUI management works good.
5,Wow what can I say. This is a simple unmanaged switch that is super simple to install. I can use one of the 10G ports as a main line back and have enough 1G ports to take care of my older 1G equipment (printer NAS old computer) and still have the second 10G port to hook into my new device with a multi-gig port. Sweet!!!
5,If your looking for a fast 10gb connection with a good amount of standard 1gb ports this switch is for you if you want port based control with basic controls this switch is for you it can also be used without the controlled features as a good dumb switch simply plug and play and using the ports as they are currently rated at.I would basically recommend this to anyone except possibly Enterprise applications who needs 10gb connections but don’t want to go full enterprise device. Very happy with this product.
2,It went from a 5 star to a 2 star review.  At first it was fine with only 4 out of 8 ports being used.  As soon as I connect a 5th device it started having problems.  Reliability issues with random network drops and up and down speeds. Since it was an un-managed switch I could not check any error logs.  It is a great switch if you only need 4 out of 8 ports.  I returned it and purchased a Netgear XS512EM managed switch and it does not have any of the issues although it is very expensive.
1,With all the features Netgear added to this switch they drew the line at supporting an explicit management vlan. Imagine my chagrin when I realized it got a DHCP address off the wrong VLAN and I couldn't connect to the web user interface.It's unfortunate I was just about to order a second one. Unfortunately if you actually use the VLAN features then you are on shaky ground whether it will actually work for you or not.
5,Bought 2 switches one in my garage where my NAS and all other networking equipment is and one upstairs where my workstation and all my toys are. The cable run between them was a cheap Cat6 cable that runs up to the attic around the house outside then back into the garage with lots of slack easily 100ft long.Full 10G speed with no hiccup so far.This is the cheapest 10G copper switch. Got this one on sale. Not sure if I'd buy it at original price since there are better options for not much more. But at sale prices this one is hard to pass.I don't think I'll ever go back to Gigabit between my NAS and my workstation.
5,I received this switch after speedy delivery. On plugging it to power socket I got funky burning smell. Immediately the switch stopped working. Turned out that the adapter had burnt out. Had to go out and get a replacement adapter from local store for $3. Thankfully the switch is working as expected. So not cutting any stars. I get 10 Gbps link speed and transfer speed between QNAP TS-653B and my PC (Both having Aquantia AQC-107 10gbe PCIe cards) is 620 MBps (5 Gbps) download and 375 MBps (3 Gbps) upload. This is as per my expectations.Let's see how long it lasts. I am a bit worried because it runs very hot. Too hot to touch in-fact.
5,Good Network Switch for the Money.  It does everything I need it to.  I was hoping there would be a CLI but there isn't enough bells and whistles to justify that.  I still need to get a pair of 10Gb network cards to test though.  :)
5,I used cat6e to run new drops in my multi-level home connected to my RAX120 at my desk and this switch in the attic. The RAX120 has a multi-gig port that connected at 5gbps to the multi-gigabit port9 on the GS110EMX with the new drop. The easy-to-read port status menu showed the negotiated speed which required nothing but plu-and-play from me. More than I need at the moment but plenty of room to grow as I expand my connected and wireless device network with the GS110EMX as the backbone of my home network.
5,Have not used tech support yet so I had to give a neutral rating. A bit pricey bit it’s worth every penny as you are future proofing your network. I will they have made a 16/18-port version of this with multi-gigabit connections. The other thing is I think Netgear has officially taken this out of the 2020 line-up
1,As with most things netgear this switch was dead in a little over a year.  It worked great whithin that time.  The 2.5g and 10g were blazing fast  but a there is no excuse for a switch to die in that time period.  I have $20 crapper gigabit switches all over the place that are nearly a decade old and still going strong.  I think this is my last netgear product.  I'm tired of dealing with how unreliable they are.  I'll just spend a few bucks more on something of better quality.
5,Used to create 10G home network (also needed 2.5G and 5G support) - works good with Synology DS1621+/DS1821+ w/10G cards. Max speeds of 1000 MB/s average 450-500 Mb/s write speeds (5G averages 325-350 MB/s - 2.5G averages 225-250 MB/s).
5,This was a plug and play setup for an upgraded network. I had 8 wired ethernet devices on a 1gb network. I upgraded the network to 10gb using Netgear's switch and new cat7 cable. It was a simple plug and play using the Netgear Discovey tool. I'll now manage the network at my leisure.
5,You might pay for the product name recognition but you can't go wrong with Netgear Products.  I have been using their stuff for 15 years and I have not had any issues with them.
5,She is warm but I'm putting 10Gbe through it going to a copper SFP+ port. Will see if it can handle it. So far so good. I have fans pulling air through my rack for cooling. If it cooks I will update but for now its running great.
5,This switch is performing great with my 10GBE NAS setup. I am getting great performance of over 900 MB/s of transfer rate between the NAS and my NVME SSD on my computer. I can transfer very large files in seconds now unlike another brand switch I ended up returning because it was constantly getting hung.
5,Perfect size/price for combining 8 gigabit ports with two 2.5G/5G/10G ports and 2x1G link aggregation to slowly grow my home LAN beyond one gigabit.  Silent (no fan) but it does get hot so plan to locate with adequate ventilation.
3,It does what its supposed to mostly.  And if you don't mind restarting it once a week is pretty ok and holds 10G link quite well on its 2 ports.  The 10G ports run pretty toasty temperature wise.  3 Stars because occasionally the 10G ports start dropping packets like crazy and the switch needs a power cycle(link bounce won't fix it).  Once cycled its fine again.Consider how little other affordable 10G products there are on the market - this is a good deal still - but not overly impressed neither.
5,Would love an 8 port 10GBe switch but until such time this will have to do so far transferring files from one PC to another is as fast as the drives can transfer files and I can now do that across a few drives at the same time... its kind of amazing. setting up drive copys from PC 1 D drive to PC 2 D drive... and also E to E and F to F... all transfer at drive speed (~170MB/s) at the same time... kinda awesome.
5,Quality build metal housing very sturdy.  Runs warm but not hot.  Handles a very heavy network load with ease (my last 8 port switch couldn't handle it) 10Gb uplink makes all the difference for shared internet access across the network.  Additional 10Gb port for a future media server.
4,Works great to extend 10gig to. Few key systems.  I added a 10gig nic to my Synology NAS and got a Thunderbolt 10gig nic for my laptop.  This switch does great providing 10gig even over my older cat5e copper.It is not ideal and I get errors across the link but the fact I can burst to 10gig and get 5gig consistently is amazing!!
5,I wanted a new switch with multi-gig support and the GS110MX didn't disappoint. I appreciate the metal construction and being able to see at a glance what speed the multi-gig ports are running at. The Lifetime Warranty provides a greater peace of mind to boot.
5,After several years of making do we made the decision to focus heavily on the quality of our network. For us Netgear was our only consideration and GS110MX's 2-port 10-Gigabit/Multi-Gigabit switch and its 8-ports connecting to our various devices made the upgrade clean fast and easy!
5,Purchased because I needed a managed switch for existing 1Gb network but wanted 10gb port for future proofing. Very easy link aggregation setup for NAS system. Using 2.5Gb port with 2.5Gb workstation and 1gb for other household systems. I've been using Netgear hardware for over 20 years.
5,This multi switch is killer fast and super easy to setup. Also this is only one I could find that can do it all 1 Gigabit 2.5 Gigabit and 10 Gigabit all in one switch. I would highly recommend this to anyone
1,If you need jumbo frame support be sure to check your serial number and realize you may have an impossible time trying to get a unit that works with jumbo frames properly (as it's supposed to). Netgear has a KNOWN issue with a batch of serial numbers that do not support jumbo frames (google it. it's on netgear's support page. amazon won't allow me to provide link here). I'm on my third unit now trying to get just one that works properly and have not been able to. I RMA'd one through Netgear support and they sent me yet another bad unit. Now I'm trying to get Netgear support to send me a unit that is not among the affected serial range. Shouldn't be hard. The serial number is on the outside of the box. But I've spent a week now trying to get someone at Netgear to simply look at the serial number before shipping me a new one but apparently this is impossible. So: Netgear has a known issue and they even know which serial range is affected have not recalled this batch and can't figure out a way to send good units to customers even though it's as easy as looking on the outside of the box. I'm sure the working units are awesome and if I ever get one I'll update my review. But the customer support thus far has been awful so I might have to give up and buy a different switch.
1,So I bought the XS505M about a month ago. I chose this model because the 8-port model I already had was working great and I didn't need too many ports where this was going (in the shed!).Initially it all worked fine - plug in switch on wire up and everything is sweetness and light. That lasted about a month: all the LEDs on the front went solid-green overnight and there was no network connections being switched. I had a mad scramble because that day (of course!) I had a demo to give to a VP... The old 1Gbit switch was hastily forced into use and I could hand-wave away the low speeds...I (and others I know) have had no problems with the 8-port version it's been working like a champ (and in fact I've ordered another 8-port to replace this one). Amazon's return policy (just) covered the failed switch so perhaps the silver lining is that it failed just in time... It's a pity the 5-port one doesn't pass muster - reading the reviews there does seem to be a theme that this particular model is failing in the exact same way for other people too.I guess you get what you pay for.
5,after reading various reviews I was a bit Leary.was the least expensive 10gb switch on the market that I could find. I was worried about the noise issue that others stated.Surprise!!!!  its really is quiet my pc makes more noise and its silent.I have it under my desk with the fan pointing away from me as a precaution.I have asus 10gb cards in all my pc's and my server.Just plugged all together..... speeds are at 4 to 6 gb transfer without doing anything.back to utube for help
5,Unit worked as it is supposed to work. I would by again until a newer model is released.
4,Love 10GB fanless design. My only grip would be the external power supply otherwise it's perfect.
5,One of the best value for money managed 10Gb/1Gb Switches with VLAN technology.
1,Not reliable and noisy.
5,Wanted to add 10gb Ethernet to my network and the ability to do link aggregation as well. Seemed like the best one for the price.
5,This is a great switch if you want to slowly upgrade to 10Gbe it makes no noise as it has no active cooling but it gets a bit hot due to that
1,Speeds are showing 200kbps when this is being used switched to the same brand but a lower older model and its 400mbps (2000 times higher).This is total garbage and I'm not sure why. Returned.
5,Does what it is supposed to do. User friendly web interface and quite responsive. Good for people starting to get into 10G but not ready for the cost of an exclusively 10G switch. Also great for people learning about VLANs and getting into VLAN setups.Only thing it lacks is DHCP server capability so you'd want to use it in combination with your modem / router gateway.
5,This is a perfect switch for an end office-- all ports are fast and flexible 10GB RJ45 & SFP+. Smart Managed Plus gives you routing choices and the cost is reasonable for what you're getting!
5,upgrading my home to 10G speeds was probably the best thing I did this year. My NAS boxes are now almost as fast as an internal SSD and the home office is now totally silent. I wasn't sure how good the builder-installed cabling in the 10-year old house was going to turn out but although the wires are rated only CAT5e I get the full 10G bandwidth throughout the whole house.
5,My main computer in 1 of 10gbe ports and my nas in the othergetting 10gbs speed
5,Worked perfectly and connected to my 2 machines with 10Gbe in my small office. I think my next one will have all 10Gbe connection.It's supposed to do link aggregation. There are some NAS devices out theres (QNAP) that offer that also. If we get the NAS device I will get a version with all 10Gbe connections and try the link aggregation.
5,New addition to my home network gs110emx is affordable reliable. Great way to future proof my home network on small budget.
5,Fantastic. Dropped in to my network without any issues (mix of Cisco Dell and Netgear switches). Getting near wire speeds using iperf. Have had no luck with the SFP+ ports have tried numerous 10Gtek transceiver's with no success. Attempting to connect a XS505M to this switch via the SFP+ ports and can't get 10G speeds (always end up with 1G links). Great switch despite my difficulties with the SFP+ ports.
5,Awesome switch. I needed the two 10GB ports for uplink to two other rooms and it works flawlessly. I have this switch mounted in my main cable termination box and it doesn't produce a lot of heat makes no noise and works happily. It's fairly small so was easy to install and hook all my cables up to.
4,Nice switch to have 10g and 1g option in one
5,10g service from basement switch and servers to 2nd floor office.
3,I haven't really used this much since the fans on this are really loud.  This might work well in a data center or computer cabinet but it's loud sitting in my room with power on not even being utilized.  If I knew the fans would be this loud I would get a cheaper switch.
4,Solid choice for those looking for multi-gig ports and some level of management without spending a fortune
5,The Netgear 5 port 10G switch (XS505M) provides true 10Gbps network switching with multi speed capabilities at a reasonable price for a small home/business network of recent desktops like the Dell XPS 8930 Special Edition Tower with a Aquantia AQtion 10G Gaming NIC 5-Speed Ethernet Network card added.
5,quiet simple installation. Not technically challenging and the 10G speed is stable for internal data transfer.
5,I love this switch .. just what my system needed!
5,Works beautifully. Totally plug and play so I didn't need tech support.
5,No fan = no noise. 10GB ports are very fast and also supports jumbo frames. Web gui makes it easy to configure VLANs and other basic settings. No problem establishing 10GB link with my Intel NIC and a switch from another vendor.
5,Although it says it can operate to 50 degree Celsius environments the unit does get very hot. That said I'm very happy with the stability of the unit and it's very fast
5,I love this switch but only 2 10 gig ports and it runs hot. Works well though not sure how long it will live.
5,Connect my Synology and iMac Pro at 10 Gbits and then 1 G to the rest of the network. I am really looking forward to the cost per port on this 10G stuff dropping. My Synology has 2x 10G ports and I have other devices that could benefit from more bandwidth (always).
5,Very happy with this switch! The web user interface is also really simple to navigate and configure
5,After doing way too much research into SFP+ and 10gbase-T network protocols trying to make all the 10g devices on my network communicate I found this amazing go-between.  The MS510TXPP features both interfaces so you can bridge both technologies in one device.  When it arrived I plugged in my wires and everything worked instantly.  Extremely pleased.
5,Quite a good buy for a started 10Gbe switch. Product could run pretty hot.
1,Worked great but failed completely (all lights on green switch completely unresponsive) after less than 6 months. NETGEAR support is a complete nightmare - probably the worst experience I have had so far (I filed a case online they require you to call for an RMA I call input the case number and the system tells me to open a case online and hangs up on me). I do not currently have confidence I will get the switch replaced.This switch also had various problems with non-Windows operating systems (Linux/BSD) on maintaining 10G connections to Intel 10G ethernet cards..it can be a little wonky depending on the NICs you're using.Yes it's cheap for 10G but like most things there are some caveats.UPDATE June 2018: Replacement switch has not only completely failed in exactly the same way but NETGEAR still can't fix their phone system support to not hang up on you.I will never buy NETGEAR again.
5,Four computers three cameras controls and joysticks. They're really fast. Be prosperous.
