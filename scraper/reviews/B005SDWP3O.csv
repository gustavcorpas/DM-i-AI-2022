5,always liked the battery. excited to get them at this price.
4,Hard to give it 5 stars because they are not LR44 they are A76 which is interchangeable but not the same thing. They work though.
5,Toys and games
4,Good batteries
3,Battery runs down very quickly.
5,I have two nativity sets for my fireplace mantel.  Had them for at least 5 years and lighting went out this year.  Could not find this size battery at the local stores so thankful for Amazon to get them to me.
5,The batteries came blister package and there wasn’t anything to suggest they were fake but I figured I might as well load test them anyway. All 10 passed at 100% capacity.
2,I received ten individual blister packs instead of one pack of 10 batteries.  I wanted an easy to store single sheet of batteries but I now have store them in a box.  The battery type is correct and they expiration date is 1.7 years from the receiving date.
5,Price was great.
5,Good deal and arrived with all batteries in individual package thank you.
5,Battery Life
5,Works perfectly and has lasted throughout the season
3,Batteries are batteries but the packaging is not as represented.  I received 10 individually packaged batteries instead of the batteries being sent on a card as shown.  Makes storage more difficult. Sucks
5,I ordered a pack of 10 it from "my battery supplier". The packaging is a little unorthodox. It was individually packed in small zip lock bags. Something I would expect if I was packing these at home not necessarily a confidence booster.Now it is possible that the seller is buying these in bulk and creating small packages to offer good value which I of course don't mind and actually like. The only thing is that I don't have a way to test the status of the batteries (I don't have a testing instrument yet).I have put these in some toys and books and will have to make a loose judgement based on how long these last. I'll try to come back and update the review if it stands out (too short or too long).Update Nov 16 2012I finally got a voltmeter (multimeter) to check these batteries. I had already used 3. Of the 7 remaining 5 showed me 1.54 volts and 2 showed 1.48.The three that I did use lasted significantly longer (probably 3 times) than the cheaper ones that I used earlier   3 Pack MAXELL AG13 LR44 A76 357 Alkaline Button Cell battery        . If you're curious I used it for the "Hex Bugs".
1,According to the provided information the LR44 replaces the A76 & several others. Maybe it does but I don’t know for sure. Not sure which is the new version & which is the old. The picture in the original product information is of a 10 pack of LR44 batteries. What I got was 10 single packs of A76. Returned the original order & received the same single packs of A76. If this supplier only has an inventory of A76 batteries then that’s what should be pictured in the product description. If feel I’m a victim of a bait & switch mainly because if the LR44 replaces the A76 then this must be from a supply of old A76 inventory meaning the batteries are old & I have no idea how long they might last. Maybe they’re new & will last but I feel played. Tired of the BS so I’ll keep them & find out but I won’t buy product from this supplier again.
4,What can I say? Batteries are a commodity item.Make note of the 'use by' date on the back of the packages when you receive them.It's only a good value if you'll most likely use all 10 before they go flat.The use-by date on the ones they shipped me is 2023.
5,These are batteries what more is there to say.
4,It works fine on my old point and shoot film camera.
4,Needed batteries for my Laser Pointer. We use the pointers to exercises our cats.  Thses batteries fit perfectly and so far seem to last.  Put the in the pointer and the pointer work.  They were a little less expenses on Amazon then elsewhere.
2,The typical shelf life for Energizer LR44 batteries is 8-10 years. The batteries I received have only 2 years remaining. I wouldn’t mind if the seller were clear about selling old stock but I don’t appreciate receiving inventory with 80% of its shelf life already used up.
5,I thought the batteries I was sent were wrong but I learned that they are a replacement fir my brand thank you I love energizer
5,seems need batteries for everything.  i guess that is green living but still have to be made. just want yhings made in the USA
5,I have two small flashlights that I really like but that require these batteries and I find them difficult to locate locally except for a local so-called battery store where the "help" is virtually non-existent and they don't normally carry this size. They say they don't sell enough of them to justify stocking on a regular basis. I suggested that maybe if they stocked them on a regular basis they might sell enough to justify the stocking. I don't think they got it but enough of my problems.These batteries are priced less at Amazon than the local store and they have them in stock and I had them in 2 days with Prime so all ended up well.You will want to be aware that the LR44 replace at least two dozen other battery numbers...same battery just different numbers.A good battery at a fair price with fast shipping.
5,Ten packs of 1 battery . Still 10 batteries so I am pleased considering how many kids toys take these batteries and you cant find them in stores.
5,Used this for granddaughters Christmas tree ornament. Batteries do no last long if left on for more than 8 hrs.
5,The kids' toys use these batteries three at a time.  At the store I think it cost $5 for 2.  At that rate the batteries cost more than the toy.  I love the batteries I bought online.  They are Energizer and not a generic brand.  They are so nicely packaged in little tiny plastic bags instead of that adult proof plastic.  The quality is great.  This is the second time I have ordered them because I didn't realize how many toys the kids had that used them.  I am the grandma and the kids always bring the toy over that won't work and ask me to fix it.  With these batteries I can fix it quick and a lot cheaper.
1,Got them for Fluent Pet buttons and within a day of replacing them they died.
4,Energizer use to make the best batteries.
5,Used these batteries in my wife's Skagen watch...up to now (1 month) the watch is still going...i suggest you get a watch repair kit from Amazon I've saved tens of dollars for wrist band adjustments and batteries changes.
1,Not only am I now reading reviews of dead batteries from everyone but these batteries are advertised as "watch batteries". The batteries are half the size of the watches and there's no markings on the watches as to what size battery to buy.So this is a waste of money two fold at least dead and wrong size batteries.No wonder Besos is touring space.
5,Needed this size battery for a Disney Slinky Dog toy. Looked all over and couldn’t find them anywhere until I checked Amazon. Perfect. And shipped immediately. My growers so happy to have Slinky working again
5,I wish they came in packages of 12.  Every window alarm in the house uses 4 button batteries each. I've used no-name large packages of these batteries but sometimes those packages contain many batteries DOA.  Energizer is a name I trust.  Please keep these away from children and pets both of whom seem to eat everything they can get into their mouths.
4,Not very familiar with the care and feeding of lithium batteries. But it was easy to replace and seems to be working to my satisfaction. The instructions are a bit intimidating.
1,Bought these because I needed LR44 battery and description said these replaced the LR44 however didn't work at all.
4,Great price for amount.
5,The batteries arrived quickly and I had my baby sharks (came without batteries) working perfectly.  I have no idea how long the batteries last but they seem to have good strength as the shark song is LOUD!
4,Convenient way to buy batteries
4,That is to say there are a surprising number of tools and items I have that use this size.  Note that these are the same as A76 and about 11 other "sizes" - batteries have such convoluted naming!  I have calipers calculators and other devices that use this size so a 10-pack doesn't last as long as you might think!
4,Positives: good price voltage measured at 1.53V on my multimeter.Negatives: Part of bulk package so did not include lot number or expiration date.  Generally brand new and fresh batteries often come in closer to 1.6V so I can conclude that these are not super fresh but at the same time they are good enough.
4,Exactly as described..great price!
2,Not as described or pictured I ordered a 10 pack of LR44 batteries and received 10 individual A76 batteries
5,These batteries work just like the ones they replaced. They look shiny (I have  always been fascinated by shiny things) and they fit into the same slot as the original batteries fit into.But most importantly they produce electric current.This makes as big difference. For example when my device first failed I unscrewed a nut from a bolt and placed it in the slot. It fit and it was also shiny but my device did not work.That is why these batteries are superior.
5,I think for the price its a great buy. I found a few things around the house that actually take these. I hope they last because my kids favorite toy a hatchamal takes 3 of them.
4,Great product for the value!  Thanks
1,These are NOT LR44 batteries. They are A76 batteries! Don't get tricked like I did!!!
5,10 pack was handy my flashlight takes 4 and I have 2 of them  the other one when into my digital caliper
5,Received just what I ordered and the batteries work.  Expect a long life from them.
4,They were correct.
5,As ordered. Good quality and good value.
5,Good value for the money. The charge seems to be sufficient and lasts as long as I expected.
5,Bargain in the 10 pack. These work in placee of A76 also. I have several things these work in- alarm clock Nikon 35mm SLR camera calculator. Pays to buy 10 at a time.
4,Good
5,Had to buy the bulk and received more than I needed but great price. One down side was batteries were in small plastic bags with no labeling but batteries themselves has the Energizer name and number on it.  I had to make a list of all batteries that this particular battery replaces and put in larger plastic bag so I would remember.
5,Energizer.. Duracell...energizer... all good and these prices are awesome
5,Energizer batteries is a good brand name to stick with.  The batteries were long lasting and shone a bright LED light through out the holiday season.  It's a good idea to have spares and at this price better than buying them signally.  They were delivered in two days very quick for the holiday season.  Very happy with my purchase.
4,Nice product
1,All of these batteries have a use by date 2024 which means they have sat on a shelf for over half of their useful life.  A little less than half of the batteries were under voltage by about 20 mV meaning they're useless. So the bargain for price paid and amount of actually useful batteries makes this a terrible deal.
1,All I can say is I bought these batteries to replace the dead ones in an ornament.  They don't work.  I suppose it's possible that something could be wrong with the ornament but I doubt that.
3,The energizer batteries come in a blister pack with Energizer on the front.  In larger letters on the back it lists EVEREADY Battery CoInc. St Louis MO 63164 Made in U.S.A.  Everything else on the blister pack is in Spanish.  Get this. Engraved  on every battery along with the battery number is the word China.  These are either knock offs or Eveready is seriously misrepresenting themselves. Time will tell how well they work.
5,This is a name brand product. I expect it to be excellent. It was.
5,great batteries.  Used them for the audio books that my boys have audio ornaments and other things.  Great price and they work well.
5,I was happy to be able to order these batteries online. They are exactly what I needed.
4,Seem good it is Energizer
3,It was a lot cheaper to purchase these batteries from Amazon then at the store.  I needed these for my daughters car seat toy and didn't want to spend $20+ on them at the store since it needed 3 of them.  I also like that I had extra batteries for when the current one's run out.
5,Delivered on time otherwise what else tosay. They’re Energizer batteries...they keep going...and going...
5,I'm using the batteries for Christmas lights and so far they are doing a great job keeping the lights glowing.
5,Name brand products for a great price. Quick shipping.
5,Yup. Toddler = music toys and trains = lots of batteries. I hate to waste and I wish I didn't make use of so many battery-operated pleasures for my guy but I can at least say that most of these toys have been gifts from others. So I feel less guilty. Long battery life. Good bulk price
5,I used this for my calculator which made it functional again. So far so good.
5,Bought on price arrived in 3 days with Prime. No made or life date came on blister pack.Can't recall which item these batteries go in. I had several products with dead batteries and order 8 different sizes and styles that are coming from different venders. Will up date after I test them for volts.product of China
5,What's to say they are batteries and last a long time lol.
3,I think the price was great but the "use before" date is 2020 and that means to me they have been on the shelf for some time.
5,Bought these for my father and he loves them. This is a good and economical way to buy hearing aid batteries. Will be buying more.
3,Most of the Batteries are either dead or die fast and are not even worth the trouble for the return.  Waste of money
5,I got 10 battries for the price I would have paid for 3
5,From Time to Time We need these Tab like Batteries for Our Acceseries and or Appliances. This is really the most convenient way to Buy them. Energizer Batteries are Long Lasting and reallly do get the Job done. Whether it's a Calculator or a Watch Energizer is the way to go!
5,Very good baytery
5,Bulk price on top quality batteries.  Highly recommended
4,ok
5,Speedy delivery. Song book now plays.
5,This item works as designed and I have not had any problems with it.
4,There isn't a lot to say about batteries but they were fresh packaged conveniently and at an excellent price.  The batteries are packaged in a single sheet but can be separated for convenient transport.
5,Great for the price
5,These batteries work perfectly for our vehicle remote and are hard to find locally.
5,Way better than having to go to the store and purchase! A lot cheaper!
5,These are such a great value ... high quality name brand batteries at the best price I've found. I have a number of small electronic items that use these and a ten pack is perfect.
5,It’s great
5,Very good battery !!
5,I needed this battery after going to a jewelery store to locate this battery and being sold a battery dated 2007 I turned to Amazon.  The price was inexpensive for this 10 pack and arrived quickly.  What more you can you ask for?  And yes substantially cheaper than that jewelry store!
5,Cheap and fast shipping
5,These batteries last a very long time and we probably will not have to buy any for a long time either. Thank you
4,nice
3,Product not as depicted in photo. The batteries came in individual tiny zip lock bags which were placed in a larger zip lock bag. It makes one think that this may be a cheap knock off.
5,Fine!  Stock up so you don't have to look for them in a store every time you need some.
5,At less than sixty cents each the price can't be beat.
5,Great price for a great product! Nicely packaged very pleased:)
4,Needed these batteries to power a laser bore-sighter hoping they hold up to what will be sporadic use.
4,Ordered for wife for one of her gizmos. Can't recall what & I doubt that she can either. Haven't heard any bi&@#ing so I have to assume they worked.
5,These are batteries. They work.  They are Energizers so the rabbit will run for a long time
3,I guess you get what you pay for.  These are good batteries - they all worked etc. - but they don't last as long as the more expensive ones.  I have no real complaints except that I had to change them out more frequently but that's not unexpected when you pay so little.
5,its what i waned and what it claimed to be for a great price win win as with most products from amazon and to top it off when there are problems i can actsully  get to talk to a humam and they take care of it win win win
4,Batteries worked fine as expected.
3,The button cell batteries are exactly as advertised so I rated them 'as expected'.
5,there working and seem to last
5,Fairly recent stock name brand off-shore alkaline. Great value.
5,very good product Thanks
5,Just what I needed couldn't fine this size batteries local
5,does what it is supposed to do
5,Most of my kids toys have this type of battery!
5,Batteries arrived in time installed fine and first is now working.  No muss no fuss.
5,Wonderful deal!  Always great to have some on hand!
5,priced right with a long shelf life
5,Very few times in my life if have been asked to give a review of batteries. This is one of those times. They came to my house upon request and contained the requisite electric charge.
5,So far ok.  Just started using.
5,Good price
5,As advertised
5,They work
5,Look these are batteries that are sold at a very good price. They seem to last as long an any others I've used so what's not to like?
5,Works as expected
5,I needed these to replace the batteries in my kitchen timers. The stores carry the the batteries that are suppose to be an equivalent (303/357) but they didn't work. I'm happy to say I'm back in business with the perfect battery the original no copycat.
4,As expected.
5,These batteries are great.  They are just what I needed to replace the batteries in our stop sign for the garage and it's great it came in a 10-pack package so I won't have to order another set when these no longer work.
5,I ordered more than I needed so I suppose I will be testing their shelf life as well as their equipment performance.This size fit perfectly into the hygrometer I ordered it for and has been working well for the last few weeks.
4,5 x 2 battery tear off package 1 battery per blister. No expiration date listed on packaging though! Working for now!
5,used one it worked. use by 2022 is date
3,I guess these are OK if you don't use the item very much but in a vibrator they do not last very long. I suppose it depends on the size of the vibrator. If it is a small vibrator then these would be fine. Not a fan of Button Batteries.
4,Good price. Can't go wrong with this. Have used a few batteries for weeks now and don't expect to have any regrets
5,great prices. great product.
5,Great value so much cheaper than the stores.
5,Good deal & battery life was ok..
5,I had a hard time finding this size at my local stores and these fit perfectly in my cat's laser light toy. The kittens are happily chasing their laser around my house once again so they give these batteries two paws up.
5,Good as described
4,Great price.  My cat's laser toy works much better with these than the cheap ones from across the pond.
5,i was looking around town for this battery and could not find it but was lucky enough to find it on amazon. and it came in a 10 pack which was even better. i was using them for timmers around my house. very good bargin
5,Great price for 10 batteries. Will last a long time. Work well.
4,The batteries work just fine and I like the packaging as it makes storage very easy.
5,these batterys worked great! full charge.
5,if your using these for anything becides watches these are the ones you want. i've tried 3 other manufactures of this type of battery and these are the only ones that didn't burn out before you get started.
5,It’s batteries
5,N/A
5,I love the packaging. Just like a little pill pack push through foil and use.
5,Great price and fast shipping. I use this size in a red dot hand gun laser. It takes four of them so a 10 pk is great
5,This is the 4th set of batteries I've reviewed. I guess I got carried away with ordering them. Anyway I have tried all batches and I'm very happy with all my purchases. Not had a bad one yet.
5,Batteries work great! You cannot beat the price!
5,Already used these up  they work fine
5,As good as anywhere at a good price.  Only issue is whether you can use them in a reasonable amount of time.
5,The batteries were delivered on time. They do what they are supposed to do. I can not say if they drain any less than any other battery as of yet. But I am happy with price and everything.
5,Bought a 10 pack to be sure I have some extras.  They ended up being "in the battery" box longer than I thought but they held up and provide good service.  What else could you want!
4,they work what else matters
5,Great batteries. Great value .Purchased for a magnet pole detector.
4,Great value.
5,Purfect
5,I found these hard to purchase and amazon comes through agaln.  I needed these for a desk calendar and clock that my wife bought me.  It is working fine now.  It took five of them
4,They seem to run down fast but there's 10 of them!
5,I purchased to have extra batteries around the house.  I put these into action when my daughters wand died.  It worked well with a good fit and did not seem old.  Each battery comes individually wrapped.
5,Brand name batteries at the best price.
3,Good value
4,battery works what else can you say?
3,out of 10 batteries I had 3 that were damaged and acid was leaked into the package. The 7 batteries that was left have performed okay so far. Better packaging where the batteries are in separated areas would help greatly.
5,Other reviewers have complained they got loose cells in zip-lock bags. These came 10 on a blister pack labeled Energizer A76 (LR44). Don't know how long they'll last but the packaging looks legit and price is certainly right.
5,This 10 pack worked out great and the price was excellent. I saw a pack of 3 in store and the cost for them was the same price I paid for 10 pack. Will order them again.
5,Not much I can say 😂 they work
5,revived old laser lights for our cat and dog.
5,Long life batteries
5,Good buy
5,They worked!
5,The price was excellent and the delivery quick. Now it is a matter of waiting to see how long these batteries will last. With the Energizer name behind them I have great expectations.
4,Very nice husband loves this brand & it fits as expected
5,This is a popular size button cell and it has many uses. I always buy in packs. They are cheaper and you have a supplu on hand when needed.  Great prices and fast deliver.
4,Good value.
5,Holds charge well
5,They came in a blister pack. Put a couple in my Nikon FG and everything seems to be working well. Guess there were some unlucky people who got batteries in baggies. This wasn't my experience.
5,Good batteries at a good price
5,Fits the size battery that the electronics calls for.
3,Batteries arrived in manufacturer packaging.  But tested 4 batteries that I needed for devices and found all tested lower than 1.5v.  For the price okay purchase.
4,Just batteries.
1,Out of the 10 batteries three were totally dead and seven had only 40% of charge. When put into the product and it didn’t work we tested all of the batteries with our battery charge tester and found this out. The date on the batteries were 2023. Totally unacceptable and if I could give it no stars I would. We returned the item even though it was minimal amount of money just out of principle.
4,A good brand at a good price. I would buy again.
5,flash lites
3,No review
5,Good deal.
5,My son has a toy that runs on these and they run $4 a piece at the store.  It is a much better deal to buy them at amazon in bulk.
4,Purchased for grandkids' toys. Hope they last a good while.
5,These were not old weird batteries in a sandwich bag as some reviewers wrote.  They came in a new blister pack and are fully charged.  They are a really good deal.
5,It handy to have batteries at home when you need them.  I bought a ten pack so I'd have some extra batteries at home. These batteries work. I have had no problems.
5,Works. Does the job done. Buying these batteries online and replacing my watch batteries is way cheaper than going to a watch repair store and getting my batteries replaced by them.
5,Arrived in small plastic individual pouches (vs. as pictured on Amazon). Great price and they all worked. I use them to power a laser light for my cats to chase.
4,As described and conveniently delivered to my door.
5,Good value for battery good price quick shipping
5,Works absolutely just fine.  My product was up and running in no time at all.  I'm glad I have a 10-pack to keep me ready at all times.
5,I haven't had to use the batteries yet but I expect great things from them.  I bought them because I want the "Energizer Bunny" thing working for me.
5,Works for what I needed for they're batteries.
5,As wxoected
5,Happy
5,These batteries provide electricity in your devices which require electricity and have the appropriate sized battery compartment and proper connections.
5,When you need a good number of these - good price for same thing you get in the store.
4,Works fine.  No problems.
5,great just has shown
5,These batteries were just what I needed--never easy to find specific button batteries locally.  Love being able to get them through Amazon easily and quickly thanks to Prime.  (:
4,Does the job...no complaints
5,work as described. Used for my daughters fingerling
4,Seem to work fine!
5,worked
5,So far so good. Too early to judge lifetime.
4,Good quality and last long
5,Works good  seems to be authentic item  saves you a lot of money over buying them from CVS Lowe's etc.  Individual packaged is a bonus.
5,Great batteries and all worked! Can’t beat the price!
4,quick delivery; good price;
1,Buy batteries from a Retailer you know.  I have purchased batteries that appear to be the Name Brand they say at an extreme reduced cost.  The batteries last a few hours only in any electronic even those not needing much power/usage.  YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.  I just spent 70.00 on the real deal with an expiration date as so many Xmas products use these batteries.
5,One cannot go wrong for the price. Even if they do not last as long as some others the price and convenience of having them handy are reason enough for the purchase.
5,If you have Pittsburgh tool digital calipers from harbor freight these are the perfect replacment batteries for it. A 10 pack should last longer then the calipers themselves.
5,Happy with
5,Good
5,I tried to find these batteries in several different stores with no luck. I went to Amazon online and found just what I needed for a reasonable price. thanks
5,Perfect!
5,perfect for my tealights!
5,You can not buy these in bulk not saying 10 is bulk but that is the most I have found. More and more are requiring these type of batteries.
5,Great product at a great price
5,Like it should
4,cheapest way to buy batteries
5,Work great!
2,The date on package was 2018. I ordered in 2020.
5,AS ADDVERTISED AND TIMELY SHIPPING
5,Perfect!
5,These batteries work well and are much cheaper than in the store. I will definitely be purchasing these again!
5,Exactly as expected.
5,I love you and these batteries they keep my things working and alive. I usually bury my products after it dies but batteries saved their lives. TYBG
3,The batteries seem to be O.K. but I don't like the packaging. There is no expiration date so I can't tell how long they will last. The voltage seems to be too low.
5,Great price. I bought more batteries than I needed because the overall price was cheaper than 1/2 or less batteries from other sources.
5,... And they work. They arrived in a blister pack and have a current freshness date... Perfect for my key chain light and my grandson's Monster Mutt!!!
2,These must be old. This is the second time I have bought them and they do not last long. Will not buy again.
5,I needed these for my jewelry caliper and I couldn't find them in any store.  Thank you so much.  The 10 pak is perfect.
5,The batteries were packaged well and I had no problem with them.
5,Not much to say except it does the job.  The time of delivery was great and it matched the item that need the battery perfectly.
4,fixed up my birds
4,They work
5,As described.  Fast delivery.
5,l Name Brand and Price
4,It works
5,Great batteries fast delivery
1,14 month expiration date (usually 7 year)Slow to ship. Took 10 days.Chinese crap. Possibly fakesI guess you should have let my 2-star rating stand. I received them & now I really know they are junk. This is Amazon’s fault because there are several people reporting the same thing & they are still marketing these things.
3,I was hoping on getting them sooner then they arrived.  Haven't tried them since they were for something Christmas and I won't need them till next yr.
5,Again I had a lot of Christmas things that ran on this size battery so I bought a card of them I feel it was a good-buy!
5,Actually the batteries arrived on time.  I am very happy with the purchase. My last experience was not a good one.
5,I've ordered many times over many years. Radio shack have similarbatteries. But they are cheap and expensive. Highly recommend thisnon description bulk brand from Amazon.
5,They work!
3,Very handy battery size.. Can beat the price.. I just got them so battery life has not been tested.. Watch this spot IF they turn out poor  Ike
5,Exactly as they are  Energizer batteries & they are great . I would recommend them  yes .
5,Glad I could fine these batteries. The alarm clock I have is very old and I really did not think I could get them.
4,OK
5,I bought the pack for one instrument and it turns out they fit three I use regularly.  I doesn't get any better than that.
5,These work as good as any you can buy in the store their name brand and you get them a lot cheaper by buying in bulk
5,Great product!  Comes in a blister pack. My son loves hex bugs and they eat batteries like crazy!  Great cheap product.
4,AWESOME AVAILBUILTY......EXACT 4 REPLACEMENT BATTERYS
5,great service and product.  arrived in time and was exactly as advertised
5,as anounced
5,Came quick and was exactly what I needed. Would buy again.
5,So much cheaper than ordering them in single or double packs in the store - work great and arrived as promised.
5,They worked.
5,GREAT I havn't used them yet.. But they seemed like a fair price so I ordered them just to have at home for spares
5,great value - just wish I could remember which devices require this battery since I now have a glut of them.
5,Is as advertised.
5,Gret
1,I ordered these one year ago and they are all dead today. They should have a 3 year shelf life. They had “use by 2023” on the package. But they didn’t make it to April 2020. Thanks China and  Eveready.
5,Each cell is individually bagged and contained in a larger zip lock bag.  Makes using the cells and keeping track of the remainder very easy compared to standard retail packaging.
5,Received the 10 pack of batteries. They were as advertised. Was able to replace all the batteries in my electronic devices that were weak.
5,Yes
5,Very good and price was great just what I needed thanks
5,No problems using this in my device.  As I recall all the batteries were fully charged.  What more can I say.
5,Nothing bad to say.They are Energizers and they did - and do - the job. Wish they had a variety pak!!
1,Had 2 of these explode. 1 was in a device when I heard something like a rifle shot. Other was already used in ready to be thrown out. Never had this happen before.
5,Received and worked great in my digital caliper.
2,These did not have lasting power in my opinion
5,works
5,For use in HP12C calculator.  Performs well.  Totally satisfied.
5,Made my 20-plus year old calculator come back to life.
5,just waht we needed to keep our cats happy with the lazer dot
5,Quality Batteries that served my need and were a good value.
3,They didn't work with what I wanted them to work with but I've found other items that can use them
1,Buyer beware. The picture with this item is brutally honest. You do NOT get a card with 10 batteries blister packed on it for ease of identification and storage. What you get is a zip lock bag of batteries. What a royal pain in the nether regions.In addition of the ten batteries three were below nominal voltage. Yes seven batteries measured at 1.6 volts but three (30%) had already lost over 12% of their charge.I really don't need this kind of fustration in my life!
5,Excellent product. The battery life is great especially since I have tried my share of brands. Prompt delivery and a very satisfied customer. Thank you!
5,Was the right battery and did the job.
5,It is a coin cell. It worked. What more can one say? They have more personality than other similar batteries?
5,Product came as described on time and in great packaging. Everything totally as expected good value for the money indeed.
5,Batteries were contained in the shown blister pack and Energizer branded. Arrived on time. I have no complaints.
5,Batteries work great just has I expected that they would in my device.  I can not ask for more that that.
5,purchased on line because much cheaper then in the stores worked great for childrens toys that i was giivng as a gift
1,None of the batteries worked when I put it in my daughter’s toy. The toy previously worked prior to the batteries dying that came came with the toy. Amazon doesn’t allow returns for them either. Mine was packaged as stated in the blister pack.
5,What's there to say?  It's a great replacement battery that arrived on time.  Sure is cheaper than buying from a store like Radio Shack.
3,It is a battery and it works.  There isn't much else to say.
5,good batteries and priced fairly
5,Great deal if you need multiple similar sized batteries.  Much better than paying three times this amount at the local store for one battery.
1,Battery  only  lasted  one  day.  Seemed  to  get  batteries  that  was  left  on  a  shelf  for  a  year
5,Received it as scheduledI plugged it into my calculator and it worked good as advertisedNo complaints for this product.
5,Bought these for my granddaughter very glad to get such a good deal gonna need them for her bird Polly.
5,Nothing beats a good deal for a brand name product. The batteries come individually bagged in little zip-lock style baggies. Strange but effective.
5,Outstanding replacement for watches
5,Exactly as advertised and seem to be holding up just fine.
5,just as described.
5,Excellent.  The worked perfectly and they are still going.  Quality batteries are the way to go.
5,It's a battery...what can you say; it fits...will see how long it lasts; optimistic that all will be good and durable.
5,Good price works great.
5,Arrived promptly; exactly as advertized.
1,I purchased a fold up cane with a light from Amazon. it was supposed to come with battery's. It did not and the l 44 Button Cell's I ordered and just received do not work. Very unhappy with both purchases.
5,very reasonable price
5,I was happy to get  these because individually in stores they are so expensive.
5,Just what my device needed to run properly.  Fair price for batteries and shipping.
5,The batteries were perfect for which I ordered them and arrived before the projected arrival date.
5,A great value lasts as long as name brand batteries.  You won't be disappointed.
5,Wow what a battery!!! It is electric in property how can you wow wow the cow cow???
5,BATTERY RECD ON TIME AND AS AGREED WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS EXCEPT I ORDERED THE WRONG BATTERY.
1,Each of these batteries lasted 4-6 hours.  After purchasing a more expensive version the batteries are now lasting 30+ hours.  My conclusion is that these are counterfeit or very very old.
5,I use a lot of these and the price is right!
5,They are disc batteries. They replace other disc batteries that have lost charge. They work.
5,had ordered batteries before and some were not fully charged or even dead -- these were all charged and was very happy..
5,Purchased these to fit our clocks.  Fit perfectly and work very nicely.  Will most likely be ordering them again!  Thanks
5,Packaging is very convenient.  Batteries seem to be more uniform but not longer life.
1,Bought these to replace batteries in a child's walkie talkies set only one is working.. only 4good batteries from what I can tell. Put the four in the non-working one and the non-working one worked.. so yeah not very happy
2,Use by date is 2020.  Only 15 months away!
3,You don't know how old these are nor how long they will last.
5,Voltage according to specs on-time delivery good price
5,I have used many batteries and this one by far outlasts the rest.
2,Got it with 2020 expiration date. Usually get 5-7 years.
5,I was a little skeptical after reading some reviews but these have been perfect.
5,Good batterys
5,Batteries work fine.
5,Work Great
5,Totally satisfied with purchase.
5,This battery is used in watches and many children toys. The product was delivered as detailed in the product description.
5,Great
5,These are good quality and last a lot longer than the cheapies!
1,I tested every one of these batteries with an Amprobe BAT-250 Battery Tester which has always been extremely accurate for me.  Only 2 out of the 10 batteries tested good.  Don't waste your time with these.  There is no date on the package but I'm guessing these are either OLD or FAKE!!
5,batteries worked great
5,Totally powers electronics that need one or more 1.5v button batteries.
1,I bought this item because it was "Amazon's Choice".The batteries tested 'low' upon arrival and did not power my clock.Check your sellers Amazon. Buyer beware!
5,These replacements fit well and provided enough power for a book reading light
5,The price is great for these batteries.
5,excellent
5,Work great and shipped fast.
5,much less expensive than the llocal hdw.
5,Just what I needed for a good price!
5,Worked for my daughters singing princesses so it makes mommy happy :)
5,Very cost effective replacement batteries.
5,Thanks for the great price and fast delivery guys  you're the best.
5,Really good value.  It seems every child's toy needs these!

3,Good
5,They are the best !
1,Unlike many other reviewers I received the 10 batteries in the proper packaging. However they are not full-power and measure only 40% right out of the packaging using my ZTS battery tester. Disappointing.
5,Shipped fast and performed as expected.
5,Like to have extras on hand.
1,This battery was listed as a compatible with one I needed to replace but was not.While it fits the spot it was not the correct battery that was listed.
5,They were fresh and work great.
5,Worked like they were supposed to.

1,Loose batteries in a ziplock bag not sure if they worked. Could have been a bad toy I used them in and not the batteries but I won't purchase them again.
2,I bought these batteries as a replacement in a dog toy. After 3 days they quit working.

2,It's the wrong size : (
5,aok
2,The batteries seem ok  the package says in bold letters Made in USA but the batteries say made in China. Shame on Energizer.
5,Good
2,Not Energizer as advertised!! On the plus side I got blister packs of Maxell batteries.
5,good
5,Great
5,nice
1,Almost dead when they came. Used in recordable pen. Not enough to power it more than 2 minutes.
1,I got a lot of cheap unusable batteries. "you get what you pay for"
2,Done!
2,batteries went out very quickly
1,Do not buy these batteries. They are fake!
1,I got an empty package today. I didn’t get my order.
1,be aware that LR44 is NOT a replacement for SR44.
1,Received and all were no good!
1,I am trying to email but it isn't finding my last order.  My batteries are already weak.  What can you do for me?
1,First three out of beat-up package were either at low or zero charge.  Big waste of time.
1,They were dead batteries re-sealed or past their shelf life. Did not work.
1,dead dead dead
4,OK
1,What a ripoff! Substandard low performing loose packaged batteries in a plastic sandwich bag. Real piece of crap along with the seller. Buy nothing from this cheat!I received these as a gift from a relative who had no idea of the crap he purchased although he meant well. I only found out as he included his receipt.
5,Replacement battery works perfectly as described
5,Nice price for this style of battery
5,WHat? They fit hearing amplifiers and some remote controls and are cheaper here than buying in a store.
5,I have these for several devices.  Everyone works with a full charge.
5,Just what I was looking for.  Some times these batteries are hard to find.  This was easy.
5,Cheaper to repair toys then replace.
1,1) LR44 is a Maxell number - NOT an Energizer number.2) Where is the Energizer packaging?3) LR44 is an alkaline battery and NOT a silver-oxide battery - alkaline has 1/3 the capacity of silver oxide.4) For this reason many of the applications given  - such as 303 357 - are INVALID !
1,Same experience as other buyers - bad packaging and the batteries did not work for two of the toys that take G13A cell type. Returning..
1,IT"S WORTHLESS.
5,Bought these for a digital tire pressure gauge.  Changed out batteries and have used the gauge quite extensively.  Gauge works fine with these batteries but have not used it long enough to tell about life.  Original batteries lasted about 2 years.
5,GREAT PRICEWORKS JUST FINE.
5,We’ll see if these maid in China batteries last.
5,Great
5,Definitely a money saver. I go thru these pretty quick in caliper at work.
1,They ripped me off for 2 batteries! There were supposed to be 6 in a pack and when I opened them their were only 4 batteries!
5,Great!
1,DOA- I tested mine after sewing three into a plush toy I had to take apart. When the second toy didn't work I checked the batteries. Imagine my disappointment to find that ALL the rest are nearly out of juice. These were Energizers so I thought I was safe. Next time I'll go to a real battery story.
5,The batteries are made by Energizer and each one is individually packed - thus they should last unused for a long time.  The two batteries I used immediately were fully charged and restored the functionality of my device that uses them.
5,Just as advertised
5,Good replacement batteries and they replace many sizes so I buy fewer sizes which saves me needless expense.
5,Très bon prix pour l'original
1,This product has extremely idiotic packaging! The blister is SEALED WITH ALUMINUM FOIL WHICH CONDUCTS THE CURRENT ! From the inside it is covered with a thin polymer film but during transportation it can rub and short the battery. So the presence of dead batteries in this package is not some miracle. I think it's fake Energizer.
1,Looks like an offshore knockoff.  Too many typos and poor English on packaging to be authentic Energizer product. Several dead batteries in package. Disappointed.
1,Would give a zero rating on overall and value for money.  The batteries last for a couple of hours at most.  Used the whole pack (10) in a very short period.  They are not L44 replacements. The old batteries lasted for many hours of use over several Christmas’s.  Very environmentally unfriendly and a waste of $.  Bigger problem is that I do not have batteries to replace the old L44’s!
5,Parfait exemple pour le bénéfice du magasinage en ligne pour élargir l'horizon des possibilités...  Normalement ces piles je les trouvais et d'une bonne qualité/état neuf/pas trop vieilli sur les tablettes à l'unité pour un prix 4-5 fois plus élevé dans notre magasin La Source local.  J'ai eut ce lot de 10 pour le prix de 2...  Vaut la peine.  Réception rapide.
5,I like the blister pack style packaging of these. Nothing to complain about they work just fine and they seem to last a long time. I had tried to buy these at my local pharmacy and hardware store but both were out of this size battery. Amazon is always good for having items like this in their inventory so I'm glad I came online to get these.Always keep extra batteries of all sizes on hand ladies and gents!
5,Got those for Garmin Vector 3 pedals for my bike. Perfect replacement pedals are happy and I can track my power use again when I train. The LR are preferred over the SR for Garmin Vector as per the manufacturer's specs that's why I got those instead of SR.
5,We have used two of the batteries for about 10 months and so far no issues.  It fits our CR44 tools.  No complaints given we paid less than $15 for 10 batteries.  I am not sure how long is the shelf life of these batteries are - couldn't find the "good until" date.  Without the date I wouldn't pay more than $25 for 10.
5,A battery-operated Christmas decoration lost its power and I thought I wouldn’t be able to replace them as they were quite unusual and I couldn’t find them at Canadian Tire. Got them on Amazon and my Star Trek Wrath of Khan is working again. Yahoo!
5,These Energizer batteries are on par with Duracell in quality and a little bit cheaper. I have reordered them twice. Every battery I've used tests at 1.5V and higher. And like the Bunny they just keep going and going and going! LOL.
1,Après seulement 1h30 les piles étaient trop faible pour faire allumer une LED. Sur la photo les piles sont neuvesAfter only 1 hour and 30 minutes the batteries were too weak to turn on an LED. On the picture the battery are new.
5,Jewellery store charged me $20 to change a watch battery $7 for the battery and it was a cheap Mallory battery!  I bought these and can do all my watches myself!!
3,I bought before it’s hit and miss as some batteries are dead and there is no expiry date so you’re never sure if they will work. But it’s much cheaper than in the store.
5,Lots of batteries for a low price. So far the batteries I've used have all worked and lasted a good while.
5,I bought these for work to use in digital calipers and they work great!
4,I go through these like water.  Need them for all the jewelery measuring equipment in the shop.  Calipers scales etc.  these seem to be the longest lasting batteries vs. Maxell Sony etc.  Just wished they lasted longer than they do.
5,Replaced the battery in my son's Thomas and Friends Wooden Railway toys. These fit perfectly.I bought 10 because he has quite a few of these trains that use batteries.Great value. Highly recommended
5,Battery works in my Mastercraft digital calipre.  Have not tested in anything else. Expiry date on the pack I received is 2022.
5,These work as expected and the price was exceptional.  They arrived via Canada Post in four days.
5,I bought these to replace the batteries in the pet alive lady bugs and electronic fish.  They are working well.  No issues
5,Who knew I use these batteries for practically all of my kids toys! These have come in handy more than once with my damanding instant gratification spoiled angels that are a product of my making. Thanks Amazon!
5,Good quality product and "fresh" per the expiry date. A little pricey but again quality name brand.
5,Just as advertised very inexpensive a single battery locally cost about half the total cost of this pack and arrived very fast!
5,Quality batteries at a bargain price and reliable shipping- what more do you need? I needed 3 batteries for a device and got these for less than the price of 3 and now I have spares!
5,Batteries. They work. And appear to be genuine. Running in low power device so it is hard to tell jow they will hold up.
5,So far batteries checked prior to use were good and with no early failure.
4,Works well in my remote starter for my car but not very long (half a year to a year maybe) for the price it's still very good.
4,Good but who needs 10 of them??? Would prefer a single or double pack.
5,Energizer... I trust the Bunny!Package was a little dusty I suppose from warehouse storage. Batteries were fine.
5,Work good for now the package was in good shape and they are working in my meter without any trouble.
5,Only used one for a glow at night LED dog collar then the dogs were playing and ripped the collar apart! The one was used for a 2-3 hours and lasted that long. That’s all I can tell you.
5,These cost approximately $1 each whereas when you need 3 @$5.49 each that is very pricey for a little mini flashlight.
3,I was not able to use the batteries. Although 1.5V they didn't fit the item I needed them for.
5,did as expected. A couple dead batteries no biggy
5,quick shippingfit grand daughters toys perfectly!
5,Exactly the battery I needed and fast shipping !
5,Parfait pour le pointeur laser de mon chat.
4,They're batteries.  Will see how long it will last
5,Great quality batteries well packaged really brought my son's Hexbug toys back to life. Will definitely buy these again as they are very much superior to the Maxell batteries we were buying before.
5,I purchased these for a great price! I certainly didn’t need a pack of 10 but it’s hard to go wrong at this price. Battery life has been good so far. Would recommend.
5,so far seems alright.  Expiration date on the package is 2022.  Very good buy for the price.
5,Nothing to say. Just batteries..... probably wont open the package for another 3 years.
5,comme je pensais bien pour le prix
5,Great product and Best seller +++++
5,Bought this battery pack for multiple kids toys.  They work great.
5,The product was as advertised and delivery was prompt.
5,Exactly what I was looking for
1,I bought these batteries to replace the dead ones in my son's fingerling toy. These did not fit inside properly. They were too small even though they are the "right" type of battery.
5,all ok  powered our hexburg  mouse for a week per 2 batts .  can't expect much more .

1,Not a good value. Batteries did not last at all. Very disappointing. They may be good for some applications but I was using them in a small led torch. Same battery in it for years finally died. Replaced it with these and I barely got a month of use out of it. Never used long term. Only when a light is needed for a short time.
