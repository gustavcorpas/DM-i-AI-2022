5,I worked in a call center during Covid as a case investigator I bought it because my wrist and my index finger started to hurt I was using a laptop and all the clicking was hurting my wrist and index finger . I was making over 80 calls a day.  Perfect solution for my problem fortunately Inhad a mouse at home and it all worked out.
5,I threw away my old flat mouse pad it was old and fraying.  Ordered this one and glad it has the wrist support which is great and comfortable.  It also came with a matching coaster I am using and 4 book marks. It is the perfect size for my desk also.  Highly recommend this product.
5,This mouse pad is the perfect size for my work desk. It supports my wrist and I absolutely love the design. This was a good purchase and worth the money.
5,You have to remove the plastic protective film for it to stay in place.  It's a very good deal!
5,Picture view on it is nice and as seen on pic. Itâ€™s durable .
5,Great support my wrist was hurting and once I received this product I felt better after a few days. The coffee coaster is just cute to have for coffee or tea lovers
5,Doesn't QUITE lie flat yet but just a tiny bit of curl in one spot.  Doesn't affect anything though.  Nice non slip on bottom  and I use the coaster too.
