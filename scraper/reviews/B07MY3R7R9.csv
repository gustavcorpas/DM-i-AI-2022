5,Just so we are comparing apples to apples we have to set the stage correctly for a good comparison and review.  Sure there are probably 100 camcorders out there ranging from less than $100 to perhaps $500 or more.  Each step up means more features more pixels this and that...  So it's important to make sure we are comparing camcorders in the same category right?  Ok.  So..This one I'd put in the "Basic Intro" camcorder category that is less than $100 -- in fact it is quite impressive that this camcorder is less than $70 and yet it delivers full 1080p HD with a 24 MP CMOS sensor.  It has more pixels than my Samsung Galaxy S10 that's for sure!  So right there for less than $100 it's got a lot to offer in terms of pixel capacity.  The user can select 3 different image quality but I keep it on full HD all the time.  Why not?It takes a standard SD card up to 32 GB in size - That's very nice because you know videos take a lot memory.  I have a 16 GB high speed 10x SD card and it works very well for my applications and a day of shooting cat videos.  The bottom of the camcorder has a pre-threaded adapter hold to accommodate standard sized tripod--which is perfect for those stable long-shot situations.  Lastly the camcorder's viewing screen can turn 360 degrees so you can see it from any angle while keeping the shot steady.  I am attaching some photos so you can see what I am talking about.It comes with TWO batteries!  That is very cool actually.  Never want to run out of battery power so always have a backup battery in your pocket.  I like that a lot.  The camcorder charges the battery while plugged in then swap out to charge the other one.  There is a combo USB charging cable (and charging adapter) with AV adopters too.  It would be an extra point if it comes with a separate externally plugged charger so I can shoot the video while charging the other battery.  Just a thought.Camcorder can be stored in a soft pouch and the pouch has a belt loop so you can attach the pouch to your belt shoot your video and stow the camcorder after.  Very handy!The function buttons are all correctly placed for a camcorder.  The record button is on the right thumb the zoom (in and out) is on the top where the index finger rests etc.  It is configured as a right-handed user's camcorder--I find that interesting because I haven't yet come across a left-handed camcorder!  So this is probably an industry-standard.  Anyway for right-handed use all the buttons are at the right place.Shooting this camcorder is simple--there is not a lot of functions to mess with.  It is almost as easy as point and shoot.  In many ways I prefer that--I don't want to have mess with 3 settings before I can shoot.  Sometimes the moment is so fleeting you don't have time to mess with settings.I also like that I can turn the sound off.  The default is sound ON which I don't like it--so I turn it off for my personal taste.  Sometimes in a place you don't want to be making a lot of noise--wherever you are supposed to silence your cell phone you should also silence your video camcorder.  Right?Turning on (i.e. flipping open) the view finder automatically turns it On and off likewise flipping off the view finder.  Camcorder is ready in about 2-3 seconds.  Push the red Record button it begins.Now let's talk about image quality the good and the limitations.  When running at FHD (full HD mode) it takes a lot of processing power than standard quality.  Under standard quality the image (i.e. movie) is quite smooth but lack the full HD quality.  Running at FHD the frame rate is not as high is it can be.  I find this camcorder limited in use in those high dynamic situations.  For example trying to video record a fast action football game you will find the frame rate needing a bit more boost.  However for more static situations such as a video blogging or just basic recording where you aren't capturing fast-moving objects then yes it will do fine.  It is more than adequate for the purposes described in the latter.  But again remember that we are classifying a sub-$100 camcorder so the expectation is that we won't be taking this out to high-speed boating for a spin.  So keep that in mind.The video file output is in the standard .AVI format.  A number of softwares are out there to process it and compress it into formats such as MPEG. Camcorder does not have internal software for those other file outputs but it is not an issue because plenty free software out there for AVI processing.So in conclusion I can say that you should expect to:1.  Use this camcorder in a pretty static well-lit environment.  It is especially good if it is on a tripod.2.  Understand the correct classification of a $70 camcorder that offers 1080p full HD pixel quality.3.  It is simple to use lightweight point-and-shoot down to earth style of operation.4.  Comes with a few gizmos such as extra battery carrying case charger/AV combo cable.5.  A 24MP rated at 15 FPS.Thanks for reading!  Hope this helps you make your decision as there are hundreds of camcorders to pick from!!  :-)
5,This Video Camera Camcorder is super fun!  First off the price is right!  It has all the major features you'd need to do some basic picture taking some HD video recording and some vlogging.Right out of the box things were easy.  I unpackaged and attached one of the two batteries opened the LCD display and the camera turned right on welcoming me.  A Menu button got me some options and I could set the Date and Time video quality 4 differents effects including sepia tone and whether I wanted my video date stamped or not.  I could also change a few other functions.The Camcorder's screen must be open in order to access the cover for the charging and component video output.  The included cable uses a specialized connection instead of a standard mini or micro-USB so you want to keep track of the cable.  I turned the camera off to charge the batteries.Functions allow for you to show the options on the display turn them off or turn off the display completely while in use!The Camcorder features a 16x zoom feature but as there are no moving lens parts at least on the outside its probably being done digitally.  If you try to zoom while shooting there was no noticable noise but the zooms happen suddenly sort of jerking in like a cool effect not a smooth Hollywood zoom.  In most cases you'd zoom before pressing record so this shouldn't be too big of an issue.  The Camcorder boasts some image stabilization but this is a feature that is apparently always on or it could have potentially helped with the zoom feature.  And although the product features and listing make it clear don't expect 1080p Full HD at 30 frames per second.  When in that mode it appears to drop down to 15 fps.  30 fps can be had at the 720.  There is also a little LED illuminator light but don't expect too much in dark rooms or for it to add much really.  However there is a place you could add an external powered light on the top.Photo mode has some additional options for taking pictures including anti-shake smile capture and face detection.  Missing seems to be any sort of timer. I haven't used this mode very much.The Camcorder's screen must be open in order to access the cover for the charging and component video output.  The included cable uses a specialized connection instead of a standard mini or micro-USB so you want to keep track of the cable.  I turned the camera off to charge the batteries.All in all for the price this is a great little camcorder if one takes into account again the price and the intended market beginning vloggers.  This isn't a GoPro or action camera and is more for a bedroom vlog than a Hollywood blockbuster.  But as the camera seems sturdy and robust it's probably great for kids or teens or very basic vlog use.  And as it records to SD card you could even use this in situations where you're worried about damaging some more expensive equipment and still be able to get the SD card out to capture your footage!
5,I purchased this camcorder a while back and despite my low expectations this device has exceeded them all.  Tremendously.  I'd say this is on-par with my 2001 Sony Handicam (that cost me about $800 at the time) only without the night-vision option and not as good in less-than-optimal lighting.At the seller explains (repeatedly to a bunch of people who seem to think they won the lottery and are getting a $1000 camcorder at this price) this is NOT a professional-quality camcorder.  I compared its video quality to my DSLR my go pro and my compact digital camera under a variety of lighting conditions.  Under good lighting I believe it meets its stated 1080p/24MP performance.  Where I noticed a difference was in shooting in low light (including natural light indoors).To make a long story short . . . if you're looking for an easy-to-use and easy-to-carry inexpensive alternative to a smartphone for shooting video I think you'll be pleased.  If you think you just won the lottery when you looked at the price you're thinking about this all wrong.  In good lighting it performed well and when frame rate and resolution were the same comparably in most regards (though the white-balance was a bit funny in that my Nikon DSLR and go pro both have similar white balance I had to edit it somewhat when doing multi-camera edits with this camera as it tended to be a bit warmer).Shooting indoors under high-intensity lighting for a professional photo-shoot this little camcorder does surprisingly well.  In outdoor full-sun the same.  I wouldn't put it against a full-frame DSLR but for this price who would reasonably expect that?In short here's the scoop:*Works great in good lighting still and video*Gets grainy fast in low lighting just like (most) cell phones or inexpensive point-and-shoots*ABSOLUTELY worth the money if all you want is a utilitarian camera for good light conditionsPerfect for:*Someone just playing with a dedicated camcorder for the first time or the first time in a while*Someone with a child that dreams of being the next big YouTube content producer (it may delay their asking for all the expensive garbage that YouTube content producers are now telling all the masses are just-the-thing to make it big but probably not since the current band of YouTubers is so convincing to malleable young minds)*Someone looking for a camera/camcorder that they won't cry if it is destroyed*Someone looking for an inexpensive camcorder for any reason who is willing to live with less-than-optimal performance under low-light conditionsNot perfect for:*Someone expecting studio-quality or even DSLR-quality in lower light
4,Good for beginners or those who like the vintage-y feel. Should come with two battery packs and a cord in case you want to connect the camera to a TV. My order was initially shipped without the batteries and wires but customer service made the process super easy! Thanks Tenise!
3,It was way too small for my hands. Felt like it was going to slip through my hands every time I used it. Definitely a kids camera.
5,This is a nice little camcorder!I compared it to another brand that I bought recently an Ordro in this same price range. This is the much better buy! The image quality and audio are better and overall the user interface is easier to use. Just make sure you buy an SD card with this and also make sure the little gray switch on the side is pressed fully up otherwise the camcorder will say "card error." Here are some pros and cons of the camcorder.PROSGreat image and sound qualityGood fill lightDecent zoomEasy to set up and use with a tripodCONSBuild quality doesn't seem the bestAudio is OK from far away but if you talk right next to the mic it sounds horrible. Also it picks up the sounds from the buttons you are pressing so you hear that in your videos as wellOverall this is a good buy and I am super excited about it! I've only owned it for a few days but hopefully it will keep holding up!
5,First there was fast shipping from Amazon this time every time.  A strong neat box held my new camcorder which I was soeager to try out. Contents were 2 batteries a multipurpose usb/AV/Charger cable a nifty padded bag w/belt loop and a usb wall power device and of course-a manual. I popped open the rectangular door underneath the camera and inserted a 32g SD card with the contacts facing the short end and clicked it in. Then I unwrapped a battery pulled back the small spring loaded lock latch and with the arrow pointing up on the battery I leveled it and slid it about an eighth of an inch and let go of the latch. Now I hit the power button went to the menu utility and formatted the SD card. After this you are ready to read the functions in the manual and set up a couple of parameters such as still picture resolution and movie size. I chose 5 mp for still shots and chose the middle setting for AVI movies. I tried everything out for pictures and movies and it all worked well. If you slide your finger to the right of the menu button and push that button you will be able to review your shots. There is also a menu setting for holding a snapshot-set this on the max of 3 seconds to glimpse your pictures before they disappear from sight. Well now all was going along fine until I tried to connect to my computer. My computer was not installing this device correctly. So after reading about why USB devices might not install correctly I also asked a question about this procedure on Amazon's product page. The seller responded lightning fast with the correct procedure to install the camera's driver. It worked and I was able to see the camera as a drive and view files. And while you are connected to your computer the battery is also charging. This battery is lithium and it hangs in there for the long haul! If I can add pics and movies later I might do so but you will see some movies that others have posted. My advice is to use that strap so you don't drop the camera. For still shots you have many resolution choices. You will find one you like and with a 32g SD card you can shoot a heck of a lot! I got this unit at the right time because my hummingbirds will be here within 3 weeks.  I get 2 to 3 dozen a year and yes they drive me crazy. They empty 4 12 oz. feeders 2 times a day. I already know that I willget great pics and movies with this camera. I really don't know how you could ask for more for the money. Happy shooting!
3,Could someone help me figure out how to upload a video to my laptop that is longer than 6minutes and 50 seconds long. I have a 12 minute video that will play on the camcorder but will not fully download on to my laptop. It plays fine up until 6:50 and then there is nothing.
2,There seem to be several brand-x companies from China selling this type of low-end camcorder: kicteck LINNSE and SEREER. A year from now I'm sure there will be some other alphabet soup of fly-by-night companies selling similar products on amazon. Googling on kicteck doesn't show any web presence and the camera doesn't say kicteck anywhere on it. So if you have a problem or need a replacement battery or charger somewhere down the road you're likely going to be out of luck.Adding to the feeling of sleaze was the fact that packed inside the box was a little cardboard wallet with an amazon logo with something labeled "amazon gift card" inside -- except it isn't actually an amazon gift card. It's a "chance to" get an amazon gift card if you send them an email at their outlook.com address.Pros:- Comes with a charger and two batteries.- Screw threads for a standard tripod mount.- It has a digital zoom operated by a paddle on top. I found this helpful when using it for video conferencing when I wanted to stand in front of a whiteboard and narrow the zoom a little.Cons:- It's fixed focus. The depth of field seems to go from about 1 meter to infinity. If you're using it as a webcam you will want to have it at least a meter away from your face.- The documentation booklet that comes in the box seems to be describing some other version of the camera. The text on the amazon page itself was actually more useful. It has a bunch of cheesy software features like "Beauty Face" that aren't documented so I have no idea what they do.- Doesn't come with an SD card so you'll have to buy one separately.- There's no jack for an external mic. It has a built-in mic but it's extremely poor. When I talk in a normal voice from 2 meters away the audio level is very low and the signal-to-noise ratio is very poor. If you're using it as a webcam you can get around this by plugging in a different mic to your computer but I assume the standard intended application for this device is making videos of your kid's soccer game in which case you're out of luck and the sound will just be horrible.- Rubber piece was peeling off of the control panel.- Won't power down using the power button when the USB cable is plugged in.- They prominently advertise the sensor as 24 MP but this is probably only relevant as a measure of the quality of digital zoom you can hope to get out of it.The following may be of interest to other linux users. If you start up the camera in MSDC mode (Mass Storage Device Class) you can mount it as a vfat drive and extract photos and videos from the SD card. If you start it in PC CAMERA mode it will work with the zoom client or a standalone webcam app such as guvcview. (The cheese app doesn't work.)
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 this camera is everything that i was looking for and i love the fact that its easy to use and it has flash that gives it a throw back vibe! i love it so much!
4,Pros: This is a decent little camcorder for beginners. The image stabilizer works pretty well and honestly for the price I was surprised how good it was. It comes with a nice case 2 batteries and charging cord.Cons: You can only charge the batteries when they are attached to the camera (so can't charge a battery while using the video camera have to charge one set it aside and then charge or use the other.) and the port is in a very inconvenient spot. It is right next to the swing open monitor so the cover for the port to charge it does not move totally out of the way without a bit of messing with it. It's also annoying if you were going to charge while using like it says you can do that the charging cord is right in front of the monitor so its a bit tedious. The "streaming" capability is only available through a program you download that you have to pay for. It isn't compatible with other programs that stream and doesn't seem worth the price to me personally. The quality of the videos is just OK which for the price isn't surprising but still worth mentioning. Finally it breaks super easy. Was attaching it to my tripod for a video one of the kids ran by and it fell. Now it doesn't work. Now I'm not super upset it broke that easily considering the price of it. But one little fall and it's done for is still a bit frustrating. I wouldn't really recommend this camera since for just a little more you get a much better value camera. But if you price point is not flexible this camera is worth a try just be very careful with it.
5,Wasn't expecting much from this camera. The output is annoying but it's easy to use encoder and transcode to ht64. The quality sucks overall but the file size is small and duration is long.If you want a camera that will record trips and family things with the sole purpose of being able to look back on then this is for you.If you want something to shoot videos with to make films or that sort of thing then this obviously isn't for you. Get a cheap canon like an old t2i. Anything with a lens and manual control will blow this out of the water.
3,This is definitely a "cheap" camera.  It even feels kind of flimsy and delicate in my hands like the view finder can be accidentally pulled a little too hard and broken.I do like that it can be put onto a tripod or scissor arm and interfacing with my PC to use as a webcam is very easy and painless.  The plug and play functionality works in seconds: plug it in let Windows find it and then select it as your camera in your conference or recording software.  It also finds the SD card almost instantly making it easier to remove video footage or photos quickly.  While you're using it this way the battery stays charged as well which is nice.  If you're using it unplugged it comes with two batteries for easy swapping out when you're on the go.That's kind of where it ends for me.  I purchased this with the intent of filming art videos.  However the white balance is fully auto even when you set it to one of the other modes which means the video is constantly flickering and changing colour.  Changing the colour modes doesn't seem to change anything at all.  The EV and ISO will stay where I put them so while the brightness and light levels aren't flickering my green background will shift from yellowy-green to blue-green very rapidly.  It makes the video pretty much unusable.  It also completely lacks a focus adjuster.  It will zoom in and out with what feels and looks like an digital zoom  but if you want to record something up close the picture is very blurry and out of focus.It also only supports up to 32GB which at full auto will only record about an hour and a half of footage in an outdated AVI format.  This is very poorly optimised for today's needs and technology considering you can get about ten hours of footage in the same space with an MP4 file.It records but I can't say I'm impressed with anything else it does.
5,Originally Bought this camara to record my family summer trips and now i record everything It’s a good Camara  and good price for everything in package. If you like low quality photos and videos i really recommend this camara.Originalmente compré esta camara para grabar mis viajes de verano familiares y ahora grabo todo es una buena camara y un buen precio para todo lo que hay en el paquete. Si te gustan las fotos y vídeos de baja calidad te recomiendo mucho esta cámara
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Let me start by saying I've been using camcorders since Jr High school back in the 90s so I've had my fair share of different devices. With that said this particular camcorder is a perfect starter one. I purchased this for my step daughter to use because she's always wanting to make videos to try to become the next YouTube Star. Here are some quick bullet points to help you decide if this is best for you.• Great picture quality. I was really surprised by it actually. Most camcorders take very low quality. This one is definitely better than some other camcorders I've used.• Zoom ok. It does have zoom but it is digital and isn’t super smooth.• Small and portable. It will fit in your pocket but I wouldn’t recommend walking around like that because it would look funny with how it would bulge out.• Buttons at your fingertips. For the most part you can operate all the functions to record/take photos with just one hand. This is great if you need a free hand to do other things.• Decent case. The case it comes with seems like good quality. It even has a belt loop to use if needed.• Battery life is ok. Don’t expect to be using this for hours. It does come with two though which is nice. This might just be a limitation because it’s so small.• Lightweight. It can be carried with just your pinky. This is nice if you are gifting it to a child because it will be less likely to be dropped.• Records sound. This can be used to just record sound and without video. This is super handy if you just want to do a voice memo or maybe even a singing solo.I have included a video with some footage from the camcorder itself and combined the clips. I tried to make it just around a minute long because I know I hate watching long videos. The first two clips are video with natural sound. Then a photo I took with the camera and added background sound that I recorded with the sound recording feature. This was all done in a free video editing program.To sum it all up this is a great camera for beginners as most of the reviews and description of the product states. The price can’t be beat for what you get.
5,Buy this if you need a great webcam!  I am an auctioneer and now have to do my auctions "Virtually."  The built in webcams on computers are not adequate as they will not allow me to stand far enough away for a head to toe shot.  I have tried a few externally connected web cams and found they distorted the image unless I was just a few feet away. I decided to find a camcorder that could also be used as a Webcam.  Wow did I find the perfect solution with this camera!What amazed me was the quality of the image.  I tried to use a very expensive older camcorder I have and the quality of the image wasn't even close to this camera.  I was amazed with the low light capability but my job requires excellent lighting and under those conditions the image quality is amazing.  I was also wanting a camera I could set on a tripod and then use the zoom feature to properly frame my shot rather than move the tripod and the 16X zoom does that.Finally the completeness of what you receive two batteries connecting cable operating manual (in English!!) and a very nice case was very impressive.  The manual frankly is not needed as the camera controls are very intuitive.  I had it up and running in minutes and only looked at the manual later to verify what I had already discovered.The price is deceiving.  You will find it hard you believe you can get such a high quality camera for the same price as a simple webcam with no features at all.  Don't buy a computer web cam - buy this instead and use it as a webcam and then you will also have a great camcorder as a bonus.
4,This is a pretty decent video camera no complaints other then I bought the extra scan disc card and it didn’t work in the camera for some reason ! But over all had great picture nice hand strap to hold it steady when videoing and had a neck strap as well! Not to heavy very light weight
5,I really like this camera I usually use canon but wanted something smaller to mess around with and this camera is perfect for that!  It's got pretty good picture quality and audio quality and it super simple to use would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a fun camcorder
5,PROS:The size of the camera is very convenient for traveling. It is 5 inches long and about 2 in wide. It comes with a case in which it slides into snuggly.Sleek shiny black and silver exterior with manufacturer’s stickers of “CMOS Sensor HD supports 32 GB” etc.Hand strap on the right side for easy handheld use and the strap is Velcro AND adjustable. Standard tripod mount underneath and mount to attach a flash on top!The camcorder does not come with a lens cap so be careful not to let the lens get scratched however it sits deep within the lens tunnel so its somewhat protected. It includes two batteries charging cable USB outlet plug and TV monitor connector with plugs.The viewing screen is the standard side door that swings out. I like how sturdy and secure the swing mechanism feels.The camera works great with any standard SD card simple insert and eject mechanismThe settings menu is very user friendly and includes lots of features like silencing the selection noises.You can switch between video and photo mode if desiredYou can also turn the display off to conserve battery while filming! Make sure to explore all the possible settingsThe battery charge lasts over 2 hours.CONS:I wasn’t too impressed with the HD quality of the camera and when I uploaded the data onto my laptop it wasn’t as sharp as I’d like. This is a good camcorder for beginner’s and for shooting without much zoom.You have to charge the battery while it’s still in the camera. I’m used to a separate wall charger. The batteries come with some charge but I recommend charging them up before use you won't find that in the instructions but it is kind of self-explanatory.I found it tricky to eject the battery the instructions didn’t explain this very well and I struggled to take the battery out. There’s a tiny spring-loaded slide latch you must push in before removing the battery.
5,Bought this for a grandson's birthday present and he is thrilled! I tested it prior to wrapping to ensure that it was operational and was pleasantly surprised with the unit.  It comes with an extra battery in case the other runs down or is forgotten to be recharged which is a plus for a child and busy adult - :).  While testing the unit the zoom "appeared" to be "jumpy" but as it turns out is was only lagging on-screen - video playback was smooth.  The stabilization is what I would expect for a unit of this cost - unless held steady by hand or on a tripod the video will reflect movement.  But under tripod use it is excellent.  The picture quality is outstanding in the video.  The LCD screen that shows what the camera is focused on is probably the most inferior of the entire unit - but don't take that in the wrong context.  It does not display the quality that the video itself is produced in the video file.  Also I may have missed it in the manual but the battery latch on the bottom side of the unit was not covered and it was a little frustrating locating it - not untypical of black plastic with black raised lettering on anything you buy today.Bottom line - I would buy again for sure.  It could even supplement other cameras in capturing multi-camera video for editing down to a final production as long as you use a tripod!  It is a great value for the cost.  It would only be a convenience IF a SD card was included or optional in the purchase because if you miss that it IS pointed out that NO SD CARD INCLUDED you will find yourself making an additional purchase.  If you have an aspiring video star in your family this is a great unit to start them out with!
5,I bought this camera as an inexpensive means to expand video recording and streaming at our church.  We had picked up another camera in the Spring and wanted to expand our production since we are stuck in this virtual world due to the Pandemic.  A second camera allows us to do picture in picture and multiple shot perspectives.Being a small church we were looking for a cost effective means to do all this.  When I found this inexpensive camera we thought it was worth a chance and it was.  The camera does everything we need it to do.  The picture quality is great.  The features are as good as the first camera we bought at 5 times the price and it is designed to hookup and stream via USB.  The other camera we bought is a standard video camera with HDMI output so we had to buy a converter to be able to use it to stream with which was another expense.  This camera can record as the old camera does but it also hooks up to a PC/laptop directly and easily streams and/or records into software.  We're using OBS Studio and this and the old camera to create our church services and it is working out as well if not better than expected.If you need an inexpensive yet capable video camera and quick Amazon delivery then look no further.  This will more than suit your needs!
4,I've recently tried this camera and this product seems nice for everyday use. It's really handy feels even lighter than my iPhone XS. I didn't like the quality of the video very much because of its low fps (15 fps) which I think can be better if you set the image quality to HD. I didn't try HD yet.(fyi Video Resolution: FHD 1920x1080(15FPS) HD 1280x720(30FPS) 640x480(30FPS).)It comes with two batteries which is great because I only needed one during a short trip without charging it. The hand strap is great securing your hand to the camera which adds some kind of professional feeling to your recording. I loved it. However it does not come with a high tech stabilization feature and the zoom is neither smooth (you can see the drastic contrast of x1 x2 x4 x8 x16 when zooming) nor optical (it's a digital zoom as described -> poor quality when zoomed) so maybe it will be better to make a recording with your latest cell phones like iPhone 11 or Galaxy S10. But if you don't need great resolution and want an authentic experience of recording and memory making this is the camera you will definitely like.
3,I’ve used this camera at work for a few months now. It does exactly what I want it to do. However...The first unit I received had no sound. Return was no hassle second unit works fine. However.........Last week one of the batteries crapped out won’t show it’s charged cam shuts off if charger is unplugged. No worries comes with two batteries. However..........................second battery crapped out yesterday. I had already ordered a couple more batteries from a seller on eBay so hopefully they last longer than what came with the camera.These guys need to push harder on their quality control. It’s a pretty good product at a great price but any product these days needs to last more than a few months especially consumer electronics.
5,I'm an  old dude who has been playing golf with the same guys for 30 years.  My friends have lousy swings and I bought this and showed up with it as a surprise and joke to shoot our round of golf.  As all the other customer  photos show it is small and very light and I thought that for the price even if it didn't work it would be fun.  BUT it works remarkably well.  We put close to 40 minutes of recording on the original battery; on for 15 seconds then off  over and over for almost 5 hours and never needed the extra battery although it did get low.Got home plugged it in and  got a great laugh.  Very clear resolution with a stable picture and you could hear each one of us speaking  from 10-15 feet away.I have taken it with us twice more and even dropped it once with no damage.  The zoom is kind of funky and jumps in steps when you advance but it does step/zoom in quite a bit.You will need to get a video card but I think this was a good buy and comes with a nice little protective carrying case.
4,I bought this camcorder for my daughter who likes to play like she's making videos for YouTube as well as making family videos she can later look back on. She's young so I didn't want to buy anything too expensive. The camcorder seems to be decent quality sharp looking little gadget for her little hands. Only downside we noticed when looking back on videos she made was the fact that the sound didn't match up with the video. The sound of her talking was a few seconds faster than the video itself which as we all know as we have seen those movies that don't line up with the sound this can be a tad annoying. Again she's young and for the price it's not bad. I'm sure it wouldn't annoy her as much as it does me.
4,First what I really like about this camcorder is the size. It's small enough to pack easily into a purse or bag and it still has all the functionality I need. The zoom is great very smooth. I'm left-handed and the controls are still easy enough for me to navigate with my right hand. The price is great. I bought this as a gift for my kids who travel but aren't always careful with their stuff so I didn't want to get anything too expensive. The only reason I gave this a 4 instead of a 5 is for a couple design issues. You have to open the viewer to charge the camera. It's a little awkward and means you have to leave the viewer open and it and the controls inside are vulnerable while itls charging. It also didn't come with a lens cover. The other issue is that the body is more plastic than metal but for the price I guess thats to be expected. However the extra battery that comes with it is a great feature. I didn't realize it didn't come with an SD card (my mistake for not reading LOL) but that was easily remedied. All in all a great buy.
5,This camera is really good for the price it is listed. Had some issues with zooming in with camera but other than that it was great.
5,I GOT EXACTLY WHAT I PAID FOR! I should mention that I read in to the product description very thourouly before ordering. I suggest you do the same.I may be able to clear up a few questions you might have. It has digital and not optical zoom. Digital zoom is more choppy and optical is smooth. It does not have a jack input for external micraphone connection. I have a seperate recorder for my audio and I highly suggest you go the same route if you decide to order this product. It has several visual effects to choose from such as B&Wsepia etc. I imagine that the navigation and layout would only take most people a matter of seconds to figure out. Over all im giving this a 5 star review because of the price and product description. You will need to purchase a memory card. It comes with 2 rechargeable batteries and AV/USB cable so you can charge transfer files and watch playback on the TV. I would sugest this product to any one who enjoys capturing the moment over making the moment look like it was shot in hollywood.
5,Great camera especially for this price. Loaded with features and great picture quality.First off- Very solid packaging. Box is solid and will be using it for storing items related to camera.Camera is very lightweight and fits nicely in my hand. All the important buttons are within easy reach. More importantly when you use them you can feel that they have been activated.Image stabilization is great. Especially if you happen to be moving while filming. On a solid surface the image is flawless. The built in monitor is bright and clear and easy to see if you are using the camera outdoors as I often have. To be honest I am not sure how it does in low level light as I have not used it in that environment. The closest I got was using it was a table lamp nearby and the image was clear.It is very user friendly. I basically took it out of the box played around with it for about 15 minutes and was up and running. There are instructions but everything is pretty self explanatory. The camera feels and acts like a more expensive one.It comes with all necessary cables chargers etc. Plus you can take all of them with you if you are traveling with it. I love that it charges with a USB as I can and have charged it in my car. You don't have to wait until you come across a wall plug.I highly recommend it-was planning on giving it as a gift but am going to keep this for myself :)
5,I was surprised by the quality of this camera. I bought this as a gift for my niece. Given its small price I was expecting a poor quality product. Instead I got a pretty decent and fun camera with a lot of accessories.First of all we need to get expectations right. This is not meant for top YouTube influencers or Hollywood productions. This is a $60 camera. However it is pretty decent for the price.The image quality is great. During the day the image is sharp and colorful. At night it does the job well enough. However if you want to get crispy images under low light condtiions you are better off using a light along with it.The camera feels great in your hand. It has physical buttons for all the important functions. The camera is lightweight and sturdy.It was great to see that the camera comes full of accessories: USB cable video cables charger 2 batteries and neat little case. The only thing that you will need to buy extra is a SD card.I recommend this camera for people who are starting to learn more about video shooting beyond using a cellphone. It is also great as a gift for kids.
5,I needed something small profile that fits in my hand for when I'm hiking/camping with my friends. This camcorder fits the bill perfectly! It easily fits in the palm of my hand and when I'm not using it it takes up minimal storage room in my hiking bag. I love the fact that it comes with 2 rechargeable batteries. I've been playing around with this for the past few days just testing the capabilities and the first battery has yet to fail on me even after about an hour of toying with the settings. So I'm expecting a good 2-3hrs of charge with this set of charged batteries. Speaking of settings this is pretty easy to use: flip it open and click record. Zoom is fine. Quality is great! The other settings are easy to use and very intuitive to figure out; there are instructions that come with the product as well. It's well worth the price I paid: about $65. All in all this camcorder exceeded my expectations by a lot. I'd recommend this cam to anyone who doesn't need something too professional but is like me and wants to capture something simple like nature and the trees changing colors in the fall. Well worth it.
3,I just bought this HD video camera and tried it out today for the first time in an indoor setting.After trying the HD setting which ended up grainy I put the Movie Size setting on the highest option (1920x1080) and the volume on 3 put the camera on a tripod and sat approx 3 feet from the camera. The video was very grainy and the audio was horrible. In order to video myself and to have decent audio I had to hold the camera so my head fills the screen. If I had a group of family members sitting on the sofa and I wanted to video them conversing the audio would be horrible even playing it on my computer where I can raise the volume to the highest setting.I then filmed outdoors and the resolution of the video was so much better but again the audio was not good. You need to be on top of people to hear what they are saying.I purchased this camera due to the ratings so I'm not sure if I just got a lemon or this is the best that it gets. You get what you pay for lesson learned.If you don't care about good audio from 3 feet or more away and film outdoors then this is a good camera but if you expect more than that I wouldn't waste your money.
3,I gave this camera to my 10 year old son as a gift and he loves it! It's small enough to carry anywhere easy to use and good battery life. It is also nice that It comes with a carrier an extra battery and a cable to connect to the tv. It may not have the best  picture quality but it's easy to use and carry which makes it a good purchase.
5,The product arrived earlier than expected which is a plus.I am starting my Youtube channel and wanted a budget camera under $100 that will do the job instead of using my phone which usually has a full memory. You will need to purchase an SD card separately I purchased a 64 G which gives me about 3 hr and 45 minutes of HD video recording time.Pros:Product is small light easy to use. It comes with a USB cord for easy connection to my laptop I find that to be a plus. Product also comes with 2 batteries so that you have one to spare I find that to be a plus.Cons:It is not a cannon or a sony $300+ camera so quality is not the best. But as a beginner I would invest in this product first then move on to a better quality when starting bigger projects. So if you're on the same boat it's a good choice.I highly recommend this product for beginners and those looking for a budget cam.
4,I got this video camera for my son who makes amateur videos. He was happy with the picture quality but when he tried playing back the audio it was unintelligible. We thought it might just have been the playback on the camcorder so we downloaded it onto our computer. Sadly it was only slightly more understandable. I don't know if the microphone on this one was just defective but we have to return the camera since he cannot use it due to the poor audio quality.Update: In working withe the seller concerning my displeasure with the audio quality the company replaced my camcorder for a new one. The new one is a little scratchy when you play it back on the camcorder but the audio quality when downloaded on the computer is perfect. Also this camcorder microphone actually picks up sound much better and further away than a second type I purchased.  I would say this is a good camcorder for the price.
5,I’m shocked. At this price I was looking for something to record my dogs and a little of family during birthday. I was shocked at the features. video pics add light darken light. Wow I thought cheap recorder but it does everything. Even the led screen is great on playback. We just did a family gathering and the best part was I took the SD card out and the family took it to Walgreens and picked out the photos yes you just click while filming and you have a pic. They decided the ones they wanted and could enhance them if need. I got the SD card back and nobody had to bring a camera because I had it all. The features is really shocking for the price. You will be hard pressed to find all the features this little bitty recorder offers. I had a what I thought was a good recorder. It was big bulky but did a great job. This one could fit in my pocket and actually had more features then the bigger more expensive camera. I’m just tickled to death I bout this and if you are looking for a vcr scoop this up. I love popping out the sd card and dropping it off or splitting there letting them know what you want. It also has a tripod and case for your belt. This is without the best deal I hsve gotten in a long time. Thanks Amazon.
5,it's awesome the quality is like 90s theme the zoom is easy to access and use and it flips around. the only thing i had to worry about is getting a sim card but i found one at target. the sound is kinda low but i'm pretty sure once i transfer the videos to my phone or laptop it will be fine. DONT LET THE REVIEWS DISCOURAGE U THIS CAMERA IS FIRE 🔥
4,I was initially concerned about video choppiness and sound quality with this camera based on sample footage in YouTube reviews. However if you record in 480p instead of 720p/1080p the frame rate is not choppy at all and the audio sounds noticeably better. I question if the information in the description regarding frame rates is correct.The playback audio will sound bad on the camera speakers themselves but is good when you upload the file to your computer and play it back. Not a big deal as I imagine most people will end up watching it on devices other than the camcorder.That being said don't buy this and expect it to surpass the video quality from a decent cell phone. I personally bought this camcorder as more of a toy to goof around with and make videos with friends. As others have said I also think it would be a great camcorder for kids. Great product for the price!
4,I think the zoom is a little shaky whether going in or out. Other than that it is a good camera and a fit for the replacement of our current webcam.
4,This is my second camcorder I’ve ever owned. My first was a Sony similar size but cost about $200. I’d go with this one over my Sony bc the price is right I’m not a pro and it does everything as advertised. My only concern is durability it looks like it may not hold up to my wear & tear more than a year or two bc I’m rougher (not careful as should be)than most.Time will tell.
5,***Updated 12/15/19: I contacted the sellers of the camera in regards to the zoom not working and they responded back immediately! They did not hesitate to offer a replacement or to return my money. I opted for a replacement. The process was simple and fast. Pain free and no cost to me. I got the new camera before I sent the new one back! Works amazing! The zoom came loose during delivery and it was not an error on the sellers end. They have been kind and very prompt in response. Great quality even when using full zoom! Camera is decently light and easy to carry around in my purse. See next paragraph for other positive first notes.Packaging was well done secure and came with 2 batteries charging wire AC wires as well as a charging box for wire. I turned the camera on and had and I discovered I couldn't zoom. The zoom button at the top was jiggly and loose which made it hard to get the camera to zoom in and out with ease as it's suppose too. I am overall happy with the light weight and quality of video and pictures however having to fidget with the zoom button just to use it is a bit frustrating. This is why I gave overall 3 stars. (Issue fixed now I gave 5 stars!)
5,I'm a big picture taker - but I really wanted something simple that I could start using to record videos and I always felt the energy comes across differently in a camcorder/video recorder. This was the perfect thing for me (female/26) to take with me on vacations trips with my friends capturing moments etc. It was inexpensive and I really like that gives you a "vintage" aesthetic. If you are wanting something high tech super nice & clear quality - I would advise investing in something higher priced. But this! This is perfect for beginner / sentimental people that need something that works well and doesn't break the bank. Its small/compact and the battery lasted a long time without even charging it when I first got it. All you need to get is a sim card and you're ready to start capturing - takes video and pictures. Love it.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I love this camera good price but I just wish it came with an SD card
5,I found this camera to be extremely easy to use. Just open the view screen & press record. The image quality is excellent & the sound is acceptable. The built-in speaker is OK for checking that the sound was recorded but you will definitely want to copy the video file to a computer to hear the actual recorded sound.I was surprised that the battery had a charge when I removed it from the box so I was able to try the camera out right away. There is no memory card included but I happened to have one from another camera that worked fine. (A 32 GB SD card is only about $7 so it's not a huge extra expense.)There is a bit of a trade-off with video resolution & frame rate. The FHD mode is 1080p but only 15 fps but HD mode is 720p & 30 fps. I can certainly live with the slightly lower resolution & higher frame rate.I tried this camera in fairly low light & it produced a decent image on the auto ISO setting. I suspect that the low light image might be a bit sharper at ISO 100 if it's anything like other digital cameras I've had.All in all this is a really good value.
5,This camera has 6 digital effects:not including normal effect.B&WSepiaNegativeRed and blue and greenThe camera will see lots of noise in dark environmentsSo if your outside at nightThen you won't be able to see much.The camera has light Balancing options AutodaylightCloudyFluorescent and Tungsten.The camera is very good in high  light areasBut it has an ISO of 400 so you probably won't be able to take deep space photography that much.The camera is very steadyit also has an anti shake It also has a zoom option.The camera has a "Driver Mode" SettingsWhich allow you take set timers on how long to wait before taking a photo with 2 second timer or 10 secondsEven a burst mode that takes multiple photos.The camera has face detection which works alrightAnd smile capture which also works.To switch to video or camera mode There is a Mode button on top of the cameraI didn't know about this until like a day later.Make sure to read the manual correctly and pay close attention to it is you don't miss things.Overall the camera is goodIt's exactly what you paid for.There is many more options that i don't have time to talk about it.Disclaimer( i got this product for free)
5,I was looking for something that could serve as a webcam in addition to a cheap travel camera that could be used for small trips (local or otherwise). If you've done any research on using cameras (DSLRs etc.) then you know that it can get super expensive. I spent a really long time researching on the components needed to set up my DSLR as a webcam and couldn't find an option that didn't require spending a load of money.... but then I stumbled upon this little guy and I was highly skeptical because it was priced so low. So I did what I normally do -- read the product details read the reviews do some googling on the product. After some convincing I decided to go for it. It was only $75 after all. Worst case I figured I could return it or give it to a family member who needs a cheap camera. It was soooooooooo easy to use and the webcam function is pretty great quality far better than my laptop's built-in webcam.In short the best $75 I ever spent. Looking forward to trying it out in other environments.
5,I bought this for my 9 year old daugther for Christmas since she loves making short movie clips with her barbie dolls and making them move and look like they r walking. This camera is a perfect beginner camera for her. The quality of the video is great and its easy to figure out which buttons to press to make it work. I only had to show her once how it all worked and she was ready to go. We did buy the memory card with it and the stand so it easy for her to just set the camera where she wants it to record and save all her videos she does want to keep on her memory card. I would highly recommend this camera for anyone who is just starting to make videos and not want anything super technical. It take pictures also so that was an added bonus with this camera for my 9 year old.
5,The camera comes in a nice box and is well packaged.  Upon opening the box I noticed that two batteries were included this is nice feature.  Battery life is listed at 60-90 min so that gives you 2-3 hours of recording before having to recharge.  Easy to set up and use just install the battery and turn the unit on.  It came on in recording mode but picture mode is available.  I recorded 3 videos of my den and the quality was excellent however when you zoom all the way in it is a little grainy.  I think this is normal my phone is the same way.  I played back the videos on the unit and on the computer both were easy to do.  The charging cable/PC connection is inside under the screen that folds up which means that when the unit is charging or connected to the computer you must leave the unit open.  Not a problem but I think it would be better if you just had an external plug in.  Not a deal breaker and the unit works fine either way.  The 3 in. LCD screen folds out and then tips up or down for convenience in either viewing or recording video.  In all  a nice unit easier to hold than a cell phone especially with the attached adjustable strap that fits tight on the hand.
4,I bought this camera and I liked it I was able to turn down the volume and now I can't turn it back up I lost the instruction manual please help me turn the volume back up
5,I got this digital camera to use for our church videos. The camera came very quickly. It is small and compact. It came with a carry case that fits the camera. It also came with an extra battery pack and a usb/yellow white cord (It's pictured not sure what they are called). The camera works pretty smooth. No issues with zooming in or out. Sound quality seems ok.  I'm a beginner so for what it does thus far is fine for me.Pro: It's inexpensive light small and compact. You can use it as a webcam or just to take video. It does have a picture function. You can look at what you just took as well. The LCD screen does turn around so you can see what your doing.Con: The battery life is short (about an hour to two hours). Doesn't have a jack for a mic.All in all for the price it's a good camera. I would recommend it to a friend/family.
5,I was pleasantly surprised when unpacking this camcorder. Seems to be pretty well made. The swivel mount for the view screen rotates nice and smooth.Button placement felt spot on when fitting to my hand. I never really felt like I had to overreach for anything. However most of the time I plan on having this mounted to a tripod. Mounting was quick and simple. Although the one issue I did have was the sd card placement. If using a tripod u will most likely need to unmount from your tripod base everytime the sd card needs swapped. This didnt effect my stars rating since u can still access the files on the card without pulling the card and just hooking up the USB cable to a computer and accessing the files directly.Overall I like the camcorder. I haven't had a chance to use it long enough yet to give a longevity review so take this in to account however in the time that I have recorded with it the video quality was sufficient for the quality settings turning on navigating the menus for the first time setting up and recording was simple.
5,High quality camcorder great price.
5,I bought this camcorder for my dad as a replacement for his old Sony camcorder that no longer works. It is a small and packed with powerful features and no longer clunky like our Sony camcorder. It has two batteries and an adapter cable to plug into a TV. The battery was charged so I was able to start taking videos right away with the micro 32SD card (purchase separately). The reviews were awesome in making our selections. The audio is great for our home videos quality when you play it back on the camcorder but even more excellent when downloaded on the computer. The image quality is excellent. It fits perfectly in my hands you can take still shots too. Overall a great value for the price of the product!- Digital Video (Full HD 1080P)- Digital Camera (24.0 Mega Pixels)- 3.0 TFT Panels- 16x powerful zoom (love this feature)
5,I loved taking videos in high school with my parents camcorder but that was replaced with smartphones....I missed the feeling of holding a Sturdy camcorder  (as opposed to the awkward way of filming with a smartphone) and been contemplating about purchasing one for a while. Unfortunately most camcorders are pretty expensive and I couldn’t bring myself to spend that much...But then I found this!!! I thought I’d purchase it and worst case return it if the quality isn’t good or anything.ITS JUST ADORABLE!!!  I cannot believe how compact and light weight it is!! Quality is great! Has a flashlight for dark mode.I just want to capture memories and not have to worry about using up my iphone memory- and for that this camera is perfect and really exceeded my expectations.The only “complaint” is that I wish it had a touchscreen BUT that’s probably what you’d get for an extra couple hundred dollars so I can live without it.For such an affordable camera- this is a win.
4,We bought this camera for our 10 year old son's birthday and he is greatly enjoying using it. I was very happy that all of the buttons are clearly labelled. The video quality is good. It might not survive being dropped from 10 feet onto concrete but I am content with the durability for the price paid. It is a fun camera for a beginner and a perfect next step up from a "kid's camera". Make sure to purchase an sd card. The camera arrived very well packaged without damage complete with a nice case that can be threaded through a belt all required cables and a sturdy box that can also be used for storage.Disclaimer: I was notified that I may receive a refund for reviewing this item.
4,Easy to use and figure out which is great since the instructions are so poorly worded at times.
3,Ok I bought this camera based off the reviews and I understand their business concept and why they have 5 stars.. it's an amazon thing 😶. But I had to return the camera because after playing with it for a while I couldn't figure out how to play my videos back and even with my SD card inside the camera for some reason my videos and pictures kept getting deleted.. if I turned it off they deleted.. if I went to recording mode and went back they deleted.. I'm not sure if they all do this but  no matter how many I recorded on the camera they all deleted. I'm not sure if they just saved on my SD card but the camera only aloud my to watch the video once or look at the picture once.. then it self deleted.. the quality is very good the sound is good.. I just don't like that my videos and pictures won't save like the average camera
5,I bought this camcorder for my 11 year old daughter who has a youtube channel that she uses to showcase her artwork. She loves to draw. However shes been wanting to expand her channel into more of a vlog that includes more than just her art but also art from around the community. After doing a lot if reaearch and comparing feqtures and prices I decided to purchase this camcorder for her needs. She absolutely loves it. Its easy to use and the picture quality is great. The battery lasts a long time and it even comes with an extra one. As she is a beginner I didnt want or need anything with a million bells and whistles for professional use. This is perfect for her. The price is great especially as I was able to get it as a lightening deal. The ease of use the great picture quality it's lightweight and comes with a case to protect it while she carries out and about as she roams. I'm very satisfied with my purchase. My daughter absolutely loves it. And anything that makes her happy makes me happy. I bought a tripod and a 32gb memory card for it also.
5,For me it was always very important to have a high quality camera and video camera to capture our family adventures. However there have been times that it's not appropriate to take an expensive item to record. This is perfect for those situations!  This camera camera came is a great box with TWO batteries. I really liked the carrying case it came in.  The camera itself is SUPER light which is great! The first two pictures I took of my backyard with the device but the pictures of the camera I took on my phone.  I also tested out the video and honestly I have a high priced video cam about 10 years old but with changes in technology this is probably better.  Low lighting is a little dark and replaying on the handheld device distorted the audio a little bit but when I plugged it into my computer it was fine.I was also pleasantly surprised at the option to record on the microphone option. Not sure if I need it but nice to have!  I'm not tech savvy but I was able to figure out how to work it without looking at any instructions. Pretty excited because now I can record my upcoming ziplining trip without fretting over an expensive piece of tech.
4,With today's phone technology camcorders are kind of redundant but this one is super affordable and does the job.
2,I know this is not a top of the line camera so I wasn't expecting the world. But with all the good reviews I was expecting more. I will be returning and Ill just wait until I can get a name brand camera.
5,I ordered the Full HD 1080P Video Camera Camcorder last minute to be able to record my family opening gifts on Christmas morning. The price was right and the description had all the features I was searching for. The camera came with a travel case two batteries and a cable to connect to a tv or computer as well as to charge with. The only item you will need to purchase extra is an SD memory card. I was able to find one online for around $10. Be sure to format it before you use the memory card. This camcorder was not difficult to figure out and I was able to create wonderful home videos of my family that will last a lifetime. The image was amazing and the sound is fantastic. I am happy with my purchase and would recommend this camera to anyone just getting started making videos.
5,I was looking for a vidcam I could stick in my crossbody bag for the shore excursion tours I am taking from a cruise to the Baltic Sea this summer.  I did ALOT of research and didn't want to spend a fortune and was very happy to find this one on Amazon!  I got it within 4 days of ordering (always makes me happy) and the box was so light so even before I opened it I knew that it was the weight I wanted!  I opened it and very quickly figured out how to set it up to use it.  It comes with TWO fully charged batteries (which was the feature that grabbed me honestly) a cord to charge them and the cord also doubles as an hdmi so you can watch your pics and vids on your pc or tv!  Very nice!  Then I took it out for a spin and found the picture quality was very good for the price and serves the purpose for which I was looking.  I will have this cam with me all the time and won't miss a thing on this EPIC vaca i'm going on!  If you were to compare all the features this camera has next to ones priced similarly you'll see it's actually better.  Almost bought the Minolta 1080p but this one is better.
3,I was using this to record for a project because I cannot afford a more professional camera but videos I recorded kept deleting and when I was recording outside the camrea just stopped working all together. That being said for its price the audio and video/photo quality is pretty good.
2,I had too much trouble with formatting the SD card. Sent back got a different camera
5,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 8 year old daughter. She has been persistent with starting a youtube channel. I wanted to get her something more than just a camera so I went searching. I didn't want to spend a lot because I wanted to be sure she would take care of it. Upon receiving I was pleasantly surprised at the video and picture quality. This camcorder comes with a travel case a second battery and a cable that connects both to USB and RCA. This was definitely a plus because most of the time these parts are sold separately.  It is small enough for her to handle with ease. It does require a memory card got one on here for maybe $8. We also both a small tripod so that she can hands free record all that she needs lol. The only thing I dislike is the that the only way to charge the battery is through camera and not an external device. However this camera is worth the buy. This small camcorder packs a big punch. I love it
4,Was looking for an expensive but decent camera for my 10-year old who loves to pretend vlog.  This is a great size and has a nice picture quality.  Was bummed when she opened it on Christmas though and couldn't use it because it did not have an SD card.  Missed that memo in all the reviews I read.  Make sure you get one up to 32GB.  There are not directions on formatting the card in the manual (not sure why) but someone in one of the other reviews explained how to do it.  Once we got the card it worked like a dream.
5,I ordered this Camcorder for my sons upcoming wedding. Was delivered in 1 day. I am impressed. Have been taking the camcorder to the beach and I love it. The quality of the pictures are clear and this camera is easy to use. It comes with 2 batteries which I charged and they last a long time. All the functions that I need are on this camcorder. I did my homework and this was the better camcorder than alot of the other models. I purchased a  32 GB SD card and it was easy to install. The features I like most are the Menu button on the back of the camcorder. It makes everything  easy to see on the screen. It has a 3" screen which is big enough to get full pictures of what you are taping. The camcorder has a zoom lens for close ups. Even has a photo mode Very happy with this camcorder.
5,I was surprised by the quality of the camera! I got it as a Christmas present for my 7 year old who loves to take pictures and make videos. I like how easy is to use and small that my son is able to hold it. It comes with both  USB and RCA so you can display videos on your computer or TV.  It also came with 2 batteries and a small case. During the day the image is great quality except during night is not very good. The sound is a little rough when you replay your videos I think it needs more volume. The zoom works great. Overall I think the product is great for the price you pay. It has all the major features you need to do for recording and taking pictures. My future youtuber loved it!!!
4,The video quality is a bit gritty and the speaker doesn't pick up other sounds other than the person holding it but other than that it gets the job done.
5,I was searching for a good electronic gadget for my brother yeah!! I found this excellent product for a small price it is an outstanding camera for this price.This is very best option for the beginners you can carry this camera easily as it is lightweight compact and sturdy.Actually I was very surprised to see the camera case simply it is a perfect case. In the box it has USB cable video cable charger 2 batteries (another surprise to see 2 batteries) and a case. It has a provision to mount additional accessories on the camera like external light.Here comes the main part the quality of the video is awesome in bright light the quality is awesome; in low light the quality is good.It has the quick buttons for easy access. If you are learning videography then this camera is one of the best at this price.I recommend this camera for everyone who wants to capture the precious moments in their life.
5,This is a very easy to use camera; I was very pleased with the photography function as well. We have an older (7 megapixel?) Kodak point-and-shoot camera that can take great still photos and not-so-great standard definition videos. This camera will be primarily replacing the video function of that Kodak and so far so good. Very pleased with my purchase especially when one considers that standard definition NTSC video cameras from years ago could reach the $1000 mark and take so-so videos. This one does HD (1920x1080). Should be great for the price even though this camera won't take 4k videos. I personally don't really need that high of resolution but nonetheless worthy of mentioning.I do wish that there was some on-board video/photo storage but I suppose (like those cameras from years ago that recorded to tape) the SD cards are just fine. In any event we will recommend this camera to friends and family looking for a great video camera at an even better price point! It also should be noted that the camera will only take 15FPS videos - again bearing in mind the price this should be fine for us. One more point: this also takes video in PAL format for those in Europe a very nice feature!
5,Wow I've actually been pretty impressed with this camcorder. For the price you really get some great features and clear video. I've seen other reviews complaining about video quality however the videos we have been recording are coming out in HD. What I found is you have to use the right class of SD card. My guess is all the complaints are coming from people using low quality class SD cards! Using a class 2 SD card your going to get some pretty grainy video using class 4 or 6 your going to get pretty good quality video. However what I found is if you use a quality class 10 SD card your going to get the HD quality your wanting. Like the listing states this camera is definitely not for the advanced YouTube star but for someone just starting out making videos or vlogging this camcorder will do the trick. It's also pretty cool that you get two batteries computer connections and a case. So overall for the price and if you use a good SD card this camcorder is well worth the money spent. I've also been very pleased working with the seller.
5,I read the reviews and was a little skeptical.  The cost is cheap so I wondered what I'd get.  I am pleasantly surprised and very happy.  I got it yesterday charged the batteries and by the time soccer practice rolled around I was filming my son.  I purchased a camcorder because of the multiple functions that it has over a Go Pro.  I am by no means a pro but I wanted to keep film so my son can watch it and see what he does good and bad and correct it.  I am very happy with the product.  I am happy to join the list of customers who have been satisfied with the product.  You can't beat the price!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I was impressed with this product. For the price you get so much more than you pay for. Unless you are looking to videotape something professionally I can't think of any reason to get any other videocamera. The image quality is very very good. I videotaped my niece playing with bubbles and it came out great. The sound is not professional level quality or anything but it's more than adequate for home videos. In addition it's extremely easy to use. I have only used my phone for video before and this was super easy to figure out. This camera comes with TWO batteries all the cords you will need and even a case. I really was not expecting that for the price. I would absolutely recommend this- in fact I already did recommend it to my brother. I added 1 unboxing video- I actually filmed two but Amazon won't let me upload both so I just uploaded the one where I actually unbox it so you can see what is in the box. If you're looking for a camera that will handle all your home video or amateur Youtube needs for well under a hundred dollars this is it!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I wanted a camcorder to record my ‘21 summer and this one is perfect. I bought gems and stickers to decorate my camera and I’m obsessed with the way it looks. It’s absolutely adorable. I know a lot of people said the zoom was choppy but I had no problem with that it zoomed in but no problem. The picture quality is also amazing I went and took some pictures with flowers and the colors were really vivid and the image stabilization was also very nice. It has a really aesthetic vibe about. I’m so happy I got this and I think it was practically a steal for the price I paid for it and totally recommend you get it as well.
4,Ordered this product for a corona virus-friendly event my bf and I are running in a couple weeks. Needed a video camera that’ll last about 2.5 hours connected to two projectors. This camera comes with two fully charged batteries that last a while (haven’t tested the full extent of them yet) which is super convenient for immediate use. The camera itself is a tad outdated with traditional audio plugs from the early 2000s combined with a usb for image. I would recommend purchasing an hdmi adapter that’ll fit a very small port.Overall the camera is exactly what you would expect for the price. Not super high quality picture but perfectly functional.
5,I bought this camcorder primarily because I was running out of space on my phone and I’m SO glad that I did!!! It does a decent job for videos and even better for still photos. As others have stated the playback audio on the camera itself isn’t very clear but sounds much better when connected to your computer speakers headphones etc. The video quality is MUCH better in well lit situations. Very low light (such as during a concert) the video quality is a bit grainy. However keep in mind that the camera is affordable lightweight comes with TWO long-lasting rechargeable batteries and has a large clear viewing screen. These pros outweigh the cons in my opinion. Excellent value for the money. Furthermore the camcorder is easy to learn how to operate and battery charging is a breeze! If you’re on the fence about it my advice would be to give it a try! This camcorder is definitely worth the money. It would also make a great gift especially for a teen tween.... anyone who wants a decent little starter camcorder.
5,I was so excited to receive this in the mail because I bought this as a gift for my sister. The quality of the video and the picture is actually amazing considering the price. I really appreciated that it arrived early and I really like the size of the camera. The fill light is good quality and the sound comes out very smooth once you transfer the videos to your computer. I just had a little trouble formatting the SD card but the seller was very helpful and answered my questions in a fast manner. Overall I would totally recommend this to anyone looking for a fun gift for someone or themselves!
5,I got tired of my kids taking my smartphone to record videos so I got them this little nifty camcorder. My kids were excited to try it out and have recorded footage that makes them happy. The use of an SD memory card makes for easy transferring of files though it took me a bit of time to purchase one because it didn't come with the device. But you get plenty for the price! Two batteries a combination cord/adapter for charging and plugging into other devices and a little carrying pouch. I didn't have to explain how to operate the device as they are simple and intuitive. When you turn it on you get a nice nifty sound that is welcoming. You can view the video on the viewer easily. The device is very light so it's easy to take around. I won't be crying too much if it gets banged up by the kids at this price point. The video quality is good. The zoom is okay. I give it a solid 5 stars for price point and value. If you want better quality stuff you better be willing to fork over at least a few more "Benjamins." : )
4,I would say this is a good video camera for the price. I bought it during Prime Week. I like the fact that I can use both the video recording as well as take pictures. The picture quality is pretty good even when zoomed all the way out. I used it to record my sisters 22nd Birthday and also took some pictures of a Halloween skeleton for reference images. Overall if your looking for a good camera for a decent price; I would say its worth looking at. Does not come with SD card so keep that in mind.
5,We purchased this camera for our soon to be 8 year old. It is by far her favorite Christmas gift and you won’t find her without it! Thank goodness we purchased multiple SD cards because she is having the time of her life making many fun and silly home videos! She was pleasantly surprised that you can also take photos with this camera! She most especially loves the fact that she can flip the screen around and record herself talking about something and then quickly flip it back to show what she’s talking about. Perfect camera for what we wanted. I’m so happy we bought It- I will enjoy going back and watching her growing personality through the years to come! Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a video camera!
5,I have gone all over this camera cause I wanted one for videoing Riddick singing and make him his own youtube page. I looked up several different cameras as far as easy of use and performance and price. And this is the one I picked. I am still learning and this is great for a beginner and advance user. Like I said I am still learning along with my new laptop. So I wasn't able to get video yet for you to load to my laptop I will update with a video of Riddick singing so you can see how great this video camera is!! This camera comes with what it calls a hot shoe adapter for external accessories. You have two batteries so you don't have to buy the batteries. It is easy to switch between Photo and video. The audio is clear. You have a cable to connect to the t.v as well. You only have to purchase a sd card. I hope this has helped. Thank You
5,I needed an easy little camera that I could use to capture some family and trip memories. I wasn't looking to spend lots of money and didn't need professional quality. It's important to note you are not getting professional quality if you want that you need to spend a lot more money!PROS: - Good image quality for what we wanted - Easy enough for the kids to use - Better than expected in lower light and good at adjusting - The small size makes it very portable but still easy to hold - The extra battery was GREAT! - Includes a case and all the cables - Cost - Nice PackagingCONS: - It beeps when zooming or pressing buttons but I'm guessing I can turn this off (just haven't tried yet) - Feels like it might not survive lots of dropsAll in all it is a great product for the price. I'm already looking to order one for my niece as she would love it! I recommend this for anyone wanting to easily capture their memories.
5,I have had this camera only a few days and I'm loving it! I was hesitant to get it at first but this is actually a really good camera. I'm surprised. It has a compact design comfortable it fits nicely in your hand and it's very light. The image quality is very good and vivid colors. The fact that you can get this kind of image quality out of a camera for under $100 it is just shocking. The HD 1080 video is also excellent quality. It picks up the sound pretty well despite this model doesn't accept external mic.It comes with a cable that connects to USB and also to RCA so you can display videos on your computer or TV. I totally recommend this camera whether you want it for your family memories your vacations and trips blogging or work this is an excellent option at an excellent price!
4,I thought I was getting night vision with it not happy would not buy again
5,I bought this camera during a lightening deal to use for a school assignment. I needed to change over from my old camcorder that used tapes and found this one. The camcorder is small and can fit inside my purse which I find very useful.  It comes with a carrying case a charger two rechargeable batteries and video cables. On the camera there is an external light that you can turn on and off which is beneficial for dark areas or nights. The videos record well my only con is that while I was testing it out there was this crackling noise in the background but that may have just been because which my hand was possibly near a speaker I'm not sure. However the audio comes through well and it work great for my project. I will continue to use it for other events.  It is easy to transfer the videos from the video camera to my computer. I definitely recommend!
5,It is definitely worth it it came with two batteries a travel case and cable adapter that connect to the TV or computer. The weight of the cam is really light so you won't be tired carrying it around.  The quality is good for the price giving a very 90's feel. The built-in audio sounds low when you play it straight from the cam but once you upload the video the audio sounds normal. Make sure to format your SD card or you may not get anything. It is great for anyone who wants to learn to use a camera to film and capture pictures. Even great for those who just want to save lovely memories.
5,We got this camera for our two daughters 7 & 9. I was tired of them using up all the storage on my phone to make random videos of them dancing and playing with barbies. I also wanted an easier way to get the videos on the computer to edit organize and store. We are all very happy and satisfied with the quality ease of use the ability to transfer to the computer and we are extremely happy with the price. Video is clear we like how the display can flip around so they can see themselves and make sure they are in frame. We haven’t messed with the settings too much there just hasn’t been a need to yet. It’s been a lot of fun so far No complaints!
4,I love that this camera is simple to operate and intuitive; things work the way you would expect them to. Brilliant color love the zoom function.  I'm still learning about other functions but feel confident I can get the results I am hoping for in about a week. I brought this to begin learning how to be a director. I'm taking a class and I believe this camera will help me complete my assignments with great results. It's just the right size for my hand. The dual battery lasts at least 1 hour. I just purchased this and thus far I am very pleased.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I bought this so my class can start making movies more easily.  We've been using our iPads but they are difficult to hold and keep steady.  I bought this with a tripod so that we can set up the camera without having a shaky picture.  It is a pretty intuitive camera as there are zoom functions and the buttons area clearly labeled.You will need an SD card for it but I got a cheap 64GB one for $11.  It comes with two batteries so you can have good on-the-go battery life.  To charge the batteries they have to be in the camera while you charge.  It comes with the charging cord and usb plug converter.This will be a great addition to our classroom for videos.  It has a flash and a photo mode as well.  This is an easy to use plug and play camera.  The batteries come already charged.  I teach special ed and this is simple enough for them to use.
5,This camcorder comes with a travel case a second battery and a cable that connects both to USB and RCA so that you can display videos on your computer or TV.  I really like that the camcorder comes with these accessories especially the 2nd battery.  The battery was a little tricky to insert since it needs to be lined up with the different slits and doesn't just slide in.  The manufacture told me this was to make the battery more secure. The camcorder is nice and compact.  It functions as expected.  It has both a video recording and picture mode. The image quality is good for an amateur and proportional to the price point.  It works with any SD card 32 GB and less or a micro SD with an adapter.  Just make sure to reformat the SD card with the camcorder first otherwise the image may not display.  Once reformatting it works fine.  For $65 this is a great camcorder to get started with you tubing or making videos.
5,The absolute BEST video/camera EVER. I am not so tech savvy at all. I dont even know how to use my phone so well. But this video camera is SUPER easy to use SUPER easy to understand and the quality is AMAZING. Its manual is very direct clear and overall just actually makes sense. I was a little skeptical on buying a video camera through the internet I was contemplating of just going to BestBuy but its the first and best decision I have ever made. I could not have asked for a better camera.Honestly if you're not so good with technology or just starting to record/take pictures THIS IS FOR YOU.Once I upload my photos to my computer I will DEFINITELY add them here but in the meantime- check out the other photos in these reviews- just GORGEOUS.
5,I was wanting a cheap camcorder for my kid to have to make homemade videos. One that I wouldn't be too upset if something happened to it but was good quality so he didn't feel like it was a toy. This was just the thing. It was a great price and the picture quality is amazing. We played around with it for some time and he loves it. It does everything you would expect a camcorder to do and it is not grainy or fuzzy. It does not come with a card so make sure you get one but I read the reviews first before I bought it and got me one. So this worked out perfectly. I love it and he does too!
5,I got this because I love to document everything and I try my best to not be on my phone so I wanted an alternative. Once I received it I fell in love. It came with 2 batteries a charger with tv port and a case. You'll need to buy your own sd card but that's about it. I took a video and the quality is great for the price as well as the audio. I haven't been able to test out the battery life but it worked well when I tested it out. I also found out it has a light which is pretty bright. DEFINITELY recommend the camera it's super light and compact also very easy to operate.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I bought this camcorder for the purpose of saving all my home videos of my baby. After realizing the difficulty of trying to save and retrieve phone videos I needed something that I can easily use for just the purpose of capturing his little moments so that he can go back and watch them all in one place when he’s older. This camcorder is PERFECT FOR THAT. It comes in a case that fits it perfectly so that I can easily take it anywhere and throw it in his diaper bag whenever he goes to visit grandparents (it’s also grandparent user-friendly lol). Speaking of it is the easiest camera to operate. I didn’t even have to open the manual to record my first video. ANYONE CAN DO IT!The image quality isn’t perfect or anything but it’s exactly what I wanted to replace my cell phone video and is about along the lines of that.I would highly recommend this camera to anyone just looking to easily capture home videos.
5,The Camcorder was received in 2 Days from seller in excellent condition ( packaged very well to prevent damage). The factory packaging was also very good and looked like a much more expensive item. We opened the packaging as this is a gift for our granddaughter just to make sure everything was ok.  The camcorder looked like a high quality piece. It had a spare battery so we charged both batteries so it would be ready for Christmas morning. We then purchased separately a SD Card for video and picture storage. The instruction book was very readable and gave clear instructions.  The package also contained a nice soft carrying case that has room for the spare battery and cables. The video quality seemed excellent in our trial. we would highly recommend and would buy another one if we had a need.Don't forget to purchase a SD Card of the size you want to save your memories We bought a 64 GB SD Card.
4,Update August 6.  New camera received and works as expected. More updates to come as I test. Thanks to Amazon and the seller for making this right. UPDATE: August 1 seller has agreed to replace.  Once received and have a chance to use will change rating accordingly. 3 stars is based on effort outside normal Amazon return window. If works as it did before it will be bumped up. Stopped working flashes pause and red recording light is lit.  Doesn't record video.  Of course right past the return window from Amazon.  Will update if I hear from seller.
5,Got this for my daughters birthday as she wants to do a video diary/youtubish type show. This turns off and on by swinging the LCD open which I think is a great touch. This is really light and the hand strap works with her smaller hands no problems. Luckily it is light enough as well! Charges up using the cable and has an extra battery nice bonus. Now to quality this thing records an almost identical shot to my 5 year old $600 Sony camcorder so for this price I find it to be an actual steal. Zooming in and out can be clunky but every single other camcorder is similar at least I cant hear it on videos. She loves it and the hole at the bottom accepts a tripod which makes it easier for her to hold. Is this a super HQ 4K monster that costs $10k like some youtubers nope; but it is insanely nice for the price and makes for a GREAT gift without breaking the bank
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             This is a great multipurpose camcorder (it takes videos still pictures and voice recordings). It requires an SD card of whatever storage capacity you wish which are available very inexpensively. In my video illustrate how I use this video camera to make movies then transfer them to a Windows computer (the camera uses FAT-32 file system) and makes recordings in .AVI format. I further illustrate how to upload a video to YouTube which you can share with friends and family world wide. You can also stream your videos from the live Internet to a smart TV which I also illustrate. This is a great all around camera at an excellent price point. It is great for everyone but also perfect for someone interested in learning inexpensively how to edit and produce movies on their computer.
3,My daughter participates in our local theater.  My camcorder was part of my camera these past few years. Unfortunately it no longer works. I read the reviews and thought this would work out good for me. Unfortunately I disagree with some of the reviews that said that the battery life was over 2 hours for each battery.  I tried it at my daughter's latest production. Each battery was fully charged and was dead within one hour each.  I didn't even get to tape the entire show because both batteries were dead before it was over and that was stopping recording between each set change.  Another thing that I do not like about it is that you cannot take a picture at the same time that you are recording. I was use to being able to do both with my camera.  The quality of the recording was okay considering the type of setting I was in but would have liked it too have been a little brighter in the low lighting.  Also definitely not the best zoom for me.For someone that just wants this for smaller amounts of recordings for things like vacation etc I think you would be happy with it.  It just doesn't work for what I need it for.
3,My son received this for Christmas. It works fine for what he uses it for but audio quality if pretty bad. It is a bit better once the files are uploaded onto the computer but only slightly. We considered sending it back and getting a replacement but chose not to (although I'd probably do just that if the window for being able to do so hadn't already passed). The product came with a "gift card" - lots of grammatical errors but otherwise looked legit. My instincts kicked in though and I contacted Amazon customer service prior to emailing the company to claim the gift card. Glad I did so as they said it was certainly a scam. Just a heads up in case the same thing happens to you. Overall decent quality for the money but I'd probably choose a different product next time.
5,We were very surprised at  the quality and operation of this cam corder.  Keep in mind this is not a 200.00 nor 400.00 item but its quality of the specifications and simple operation has given us many great memories with our family and grand children.  Love the fact we can share or keep our use on 32GB SD card and not use phone or tablet or "the CLOUD".  Today every move we make is traced filed and reviewed as are photos we send to friends relatives etc. Ifwe want to share simple copy of SD.  The lighweight took a little getting used to as it is composite lightweight material not metal yet we hardly tire from extended use and it is so much easier to carry--no bulky carrying straped bags but a simple belt looped pouch.  PS in your hand it resembles the higher end cameras in appearance and some will consider that a plus as well--we do.  You won't go broke on this purchase and should you loose it or damage it on your own for its selling price pick up another one instead of ponying up another 200-400.00 dollars.
5,Didn't come with any information on how to charge the two battery's it came with and no one knew on youtube either (Poor job on all the reviewers)Here is how:To charge the battery on the kicteck Video Camera Recorder - You plug in the cable into the slot where you down load your video from to your PC. (Behind rubber plug) after you open the viewing screen Then use the power button to turn off the camera in the same selections area. Then plug the USB side into your PC or the provided 110 volt adapter / USB. You will see a Red charging light come on - next to where the blue light comes on. (Blue light stays off during charging cycle.)
2,Had this for 2 weeks and Everything is great except I haven’t been able to use it once no saving no nothing this is more of a question than a review everyday it asks me to Format it every time I turn it on I got the SD Card and it still won’t let me use it I need help please.
5,This camcorder is exactly what I was looking for!  First of all it is lightweight and easy to use.  The picture quality is crisp and detailed. The zoom feature is precise and clear.  The image stabilization is spot on and remains clear and crisp.  The batteries included are new and fully charged.  I purchased this camcorder to film my grandsons in their sports so am a bit technology challenged.  This camcorder fits my needs and the directions are easy to understand.  I also purchased this with the memory card and tripod package.  Love it and highly recommend!!!
5,The camera comes with 2 rechargeable batteries a cord that allows for recharging and connecting to various A/V components (I only sue the USB to transfer videos to my computer) and a case. It's very easy to use lots of features (filters and other editing capabilities). I ran through the menu and explored it and found it self-explanatory enough that I didn't need to open the manual. Started taking movies right away and they are fine. My application is to mount the camera (as one of three) on stands and record my band from different angles. Then i load the video into my computer edit the different angles into a single video add and sync the audio recording (recorded separately but the camera also has mics to record sound) and make promotional videos. It works great for my purposes .
4,It not bad but could use a little more on the zoom power itself
4,Still trying to figure it out but yes it’s much Easier then my phone
4,Sound quality isn't like recording in a studio of course the camera isn't even $100. So I'm ok with it. Only issue I have is the zoom not working. Gonna try to replace and see if that fixes.UPDATEReplacement process is so easy. This camera is worth it. i use it to capture memories before we realize they're the good one.
5,For about $60 this camera works better than expected when I decided to purchase it for an incoming trip. This is for no means professional videos or such but is perfect and reliable when using to capture moments in an upcoming trip.The image quality was simply fantastic as it captures each picture with great details. The battery life is strong as well and lasted a full day before I needed to recharge it so you can use it for a good amount of time without having to worry about battery life.It was difficult to take pictures where lighting wasn't the best as the camera's built in light did not do much to help. It was much easier to find some alternative means of lighting. As well the sound quality isn't the best as it was somewhat difficult to get it to catch our voices when recording.Overall the camera perform all the functions we needed out of it and I would recommend this product to people who are looking for a camera that's affordable.
4,Lightweight and easy to use. Just want I need for on the go documenting
4,My son ordered this camera to start a YouTube channel. Overall it’s a decent camera. We haven’t had much time to play around with it but seems OK so far. I will update the review once we have used it more
4,I just bought this and tried to post my video straight to YouTube. The sound is not synced. I think the video is a bit fast. Anyone else have this problem. Any solution?I have amended my rating from 1 to 4. This is a cheap camera. Bur I found that if I shot at 640 (not HD) I could get everything working well. The picture is not as good as my phone but I post a lot to YouTube and it is nice to have a camera I can use at any time with no worries about data space. Again plastic cheap. But so far I have filmed a lot with it. For something under $100 I am fairly pleased. I might even try HD at some point. But I don't even have video editing. I am a caveman.
5,I purchased this video camera camcorder as a gift for my daughter as a gift  and am blown away by the quality of this device.  The camera is lightweight but sturdy and very easy to hold and operate for little hands.  It comes with everything you need including two batteries - a great bonus if you do a lot of recording.  My daughter has not stopped recording on this since she received it.  The camera has fantastic picture quality and image stabilization.  The instructions are clear and the set up is simple.  Simply an awesome purchase for a great price.  I would highly recommend this product.
5,I love this camera !! It can record the videos -then transfer them to my PC without having to buy an adapter- it comes with 2 battery packs AND the cord with a UBS  and AV connections.  It has a zoom feature that is really easy to use & it also takes pictures!!!! This was a great surprise to me. It is easy to use charge and transfer. It is so easy my 9 year old already knows how to do everything after 5 minutes of looking at it. !!! LOVE -LOVE- LOVE This product. !!!  Highly Recommend
5,This is a perfect handy little camcorder. It comes with a little sleeve so you can keep it safe when not in use. It fist perfectly in my hands so it feels nice an secure when my hand is in the hand strap. For the price you can not go wrong it has a zoom function can take pictures you can even use it while it is charging. I got it for multiple reasons for kids sporting events for vacations/road trips and really for anything I'd like to take video or pictures of. I would recommend this to anyone I am in love with it.
5,When I first saw this camera it immediately caught my attention. But just as quickly as it caught my attention it caught my skepticism. We've all gotten ripped off. Ordered a product that seemed so great just for it to arrive and COMPLETELY disappoint us. Well this camcorder this camcorder right here is worth WAY more than its asking price. The quality of the images are truly HD. (Quality is much better with light present) The features are plentiful and versatile. Sound is fantastic as long as you dont have crazy amounts of background going on. And best of all an average SD card can store up to 3 and a half hours video+ on this camcorder. I am IN LOVE. Needless to say if you're in doubt about this purchase dont be.... I am completely satisfied. And thats an understatement.
5,I'm having my first son next week i wanted a camera as quick as possible at a good price. I found this one ordered it last Sunday it arrived tuesday with charged batteries (2 so you get a backup).. Order a SD card to go with it because it comes with none (i got one for 8 bucks). Seems to work good comes with a little case too! Perfect to throw in little man's diaper bag cheap enough that if it gets broken or lost not the end of the world. It seems like it is going to be good for my needs you can tell it's not Sony or whatever big name but it wasn't 300 either although i wish it came with a lens cap. Good cam for the cash i recommend it!
5,This is a great little camera at a great price.  It is small so it's easy to hold even for someone with small hands.  The zoom option works well and keeps a clear picture not grainy. Picture quality overall is clear.  The image stabilization works quite well too.  It accounts for the normal shaking of your hand while you're holding it and keeps the picture stable.  The battery life lasts great on one charge as well.It's light and easy to carry. This is a great little camera for home videos and capturing those important moments. I would definitely recommend it great value.
5,I don't know why I waited so long to buy a video camera and I'm really glad I picked this one.  Since it's my first one I didn't want a lot of complicated bells and whistles.  This has more than just the basics but it's easy to use and that was important to me.  I hardly needed the manual at all it's very intuitive to set up.  It fits in your hand comfortably all the buttons are where they should be where you expect them to be no searching for a button and losing a great shot.  Finally getting great videos of my dog and cat so they can be internet sensations!
4,Nice and user-friendly I use this at my weddingFrances
5,I love this video camera. I purchased for my daughter as she loves to sing and had been wanting to record herself as well as to take on school trips since phones aren't allowed. This is nice and compact. It's very used friendly. I think the best part about this video camera is the TWO batteries! I also love that it takes a normal size sd card and not micro which is alot easier for my 10yr old to use. Honestly I wanted to purchase this for myself for a while since I want to start YouTube so now I'll just borrow hers and we can both enjoy it! We received this item 5 days ago and have it to her 3 days ago. She hasn't put it down and has yet to charge the batteries so the battery life is good as well! Can't ask for more! Would highly recommend!
5,This camera was a gift for my daughter for Christmas she loves making videos. We both quickly learned how to navigate the menu and features. This camera is comparable to the more expensive Sony " Handycam" DCR-SX45. Though the menu system is a bit less user friendly for the price this camera is great. Did I mention my daughter is 7 yrs old? Camera came with 2 batteries charge cord small protective carrying case USB A/V cable and readable instructions. There is too many features to break down here but overall this was a good choice for my little girl to get creative and express herself through making videos.
5,USE THE RIGHT SETTINGS TO GET GOOD VIDEO AND PICTURE QUALITYMy camera arrived exactly at the stipulated time impressively well packaged.Excitedly I brought it out to try it out. In the package was a travel case two batteries and a cable that connects both to USB and RCA so videos  and pictures can be displayed on your TV or computer. Such accessories actually add value to the camera. It's advisable to go through the manual before using the camera because the picture and video quality was much better after I utilized the settings provided on the manual and it even got better as I continued to use it.The camcorder is compact portable and easy to carry around. The functions are exactly as described. I really love the zoom feature. You could easily switch from video mode to picture mode and vice versa making it very user friendly. Using the right settings for the occasion the image and video quality are quite impressive and commendable.
5,This camera was bought for my daughter on Christmas and she loved it. The size of the hand strap was adjustable so it was snug around her hands while maneuvering. The interface is simple enough that she can operate it alone with no problems. The pictures come out pretty clear and there’s also a light built in to help with the shots in darker situations. There is also a zoom feature which she loves to use while sneaking around the house to take pictures without anyone knowing. Also with a adjustable screen she is able to get multiple angles for her videos and pictures without “blind shooting”.
5,I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas. She was so thrilled when she got it! The product came on a very cute package and was also packaged very nicely. First thing the camera looks really nice and expensive and very cute! It fits perfectly in my daughter's little hands. My daughter uses this video camera to make little movies with her puppies. The quality of the pictures and videos are really good! The instructions are also very easy to follow. My 8 year old daughter set it up all by herself.  Overall  this camera is a great purchase. Very good video and picture quality! Highly recommended!
5,Great camcorder! Small and lightweight so it is very portable. Super easy to use just flip it open press the power button point and shoot. I used this for my Senior Project where I had to film myself doing a trash cleanup in a river. I just charged it up popped a card and battery in and I was good to go! Got on the water and filmed no problem! There was a handy switch for zooming image quality was great and then I popped out the card and loaded the clips into my PC super easy. Great camcorder great price!
5,I got this camera for our church as a inexpensive streaming camera.  the add said that an app would have to be used for this model for streaming but windows 7 and 10 had no issues with connecting it to my app for Youtube streaming and streaming on Youtube using the Youtube studio. I tried all the functions briefly and all worked as described. great image for this price range. the zoom function is ok. not a wide zoom range but really not necessary for what I use this for.  The image stabilization works but you get what you pay for. overall works well for what I am using it for.UpdateCamera works great after several hour long streams. Great little camera so far
5,I find this is a great product for the price paid. I bought it to record my daughter’s softball games and the picture is quite crisp. I used a tripod so the images were stable and I was able to easily zoom in and out. Then it only took a couple of minutes to upload the videos to my computer. The picture quality was clear on the computer and I was surprised at the range of sound it picked up. The instructions provided on the amazon page and booklet helped me get up to speed on how to use the camera.
5,I purchased this for my 5 year old son who loves to make home videos. I am very happy with the quality of this item. It is easy enough to use that he is able to navigate it. It charges quickly and came with two batteries which is an awesome plus! It is super sturdy and has withstood several drops. He really enjoys playing with the zoom feature and the preset filters. This is a great beginner camera or one for kiddos to play around with. I'm really happy with my purchase. This is great quality for the price. Definitely recommend.
5,I bought this for taking videos (if that isn't obvious) and once I get a full year of videos of my friends and I I plan on making one big montage thing. See if that works out lolI love the zooming in and out feature (it zooms very close which is helpful for . . . when I need to zoom into things far away lol. XDidk if this review is helpful or not but it's just my experience with this camera and my opnion! :)Very easy and efficient to use but just remember that a memory card is not included.
4,This is good but the HD is not as clear . It work best outdoor with natural  light.
5,Tiny and effective.  When I saw the box I almost kicked myself for not checking out the specs when I bought it.  But once I started playing with it  I realized its the perfect size for my hands.  So far its been very easy to use and figure out (it's my first non-phone video camera). Takes real clear video while i'm working even picks up pencil marks on my canvas and  does go fuzzy when  zoom.  Only issues I've had so far is getting the SD card in and out the location makes it hard for me to manage with my nails (not long but still a problem).
4,This is great for beginners or for people who don’t use cameras that often. I used this for my daughters talent show and it was fine. When you record and playback on the camera the sound may come off bad but once I uploaded it to my computer the sound was clear and the picture quality was good. It did the job just fine. I was able to record my daughters talent show with no problems and I’m not the most tech savvy person but it was easy to figure out.
5,I haven’t fiddled with it as much as I’d like to write a really robust review but I found it really easy to use out of the box and the price is very reasonable - you get what you pay for it’s an entry-level camera that allows you to easily shoot video. I’d say it’s especially useful for someone looking to shoot video without having to learn all the bells and whistles - it’s a video version of point-and-shoot. The camera comes with a spare battery and a carrier case and the camera itself comes with a strap. To me it seems well-made and thoughtfully packaged. Make sure that you have an SD card - it won’t work without it! I’d also recommend a tripod - if you get a mini tripod make sure that it allows you to maneuver the legs of the tripod in terms of shape not just angle - the Amazon Basics mini tripod was quite useless because the camera angle was limited by the tripod’s lack of flexibility.
4,This is my first time trying this product and I love it. The camera was packaged in a beautiful white box keeping the contents stabilized. The camera is very easy to use. All the features are excellent for making family videos YouTube or blogs. Once you read the instructions tinker with it you will be in love with this camcorder. I will recommend this product to all my family and friends.Edit: the microphone is horrible so I purchased an attachable mic - there is no plug-in for a mic I gave it to my 10 yr old nephew.
5,While preparing for an international holiday I discovered that my video camera had died.  After several internet searches I found myself considering this little guy.  After asking a question regarding overseas voltage I found out it would operate the charger with the 220 volt system.  (It only took overnight for the seller to answer this :0) I have found it to work very well I am satisfied  with all the features and operations.  I was most impressed with the battery life almost an hour and a half of continuous recording and two batteries are supplied.  For my trip to the Philippines this should be great!  Very compact takes 24M(6000x4500) JPEGs 1080P(15FPS) AVI Video Resolution and even has a hand strap and a steady cam function which helps make crisp pictures and smooth video.  Since I will be traveling in Jeepneys and tricycles and pretty much guaranteed rain I wasn't comfortable getting a 300.00 unit.  This camcorder will do everything I need at very little risk.
5,I GOT THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE I AM STARTING A BLOG FOR MY CRAFT I HAVE RECORDED 2 VIDEOS AND I WAS PLEASENTLY SURPRISE OF THE IMAGE QUALITY AND THE ZOOM FEATURE. WHEN I BOUGHT IT I WASN'T SO SURE THAT IT WILL DO THE JOB BUT LIKE I SAID WOW VERY NICE. THE ONLY THINK I MISS IS THE CARD BUT I USED ONE OF THE ONE I HAD. I WILL NEED MORE ANYWAY. THANK YOU SHIPMENT WAS FAST AND IN PERFECT CONDITION AT RECEIVING. I WILL REFER THIS PRODUCT TO OHTERS FOR SURE.THANK YOU THAT MAKES ME BE ABLE TO PRODUCE SOME EXTRA CASH WITHIN MY BUDGET.
5,For around $60 this camera is actually pretty dope. It came with two charged batteries which were kinda tricky to put in but that probably makes it more secured. It came with a cable to charge and to input in your computer and such. I really like the aesthetic of the camera and the quality of the pictures it makes it look vintage which i really like. Honestly for the price it’s a really good camera and I would easily recommend this for beginners or teens playing around with making vlogs and making some cute memories
5,I brought this product for my 9 year old daughter for the 2020 Christmas holiday. She been asking me for a camcorder for a while now and I finally gave in. I took it out the box to set it up and make sure it was working properly. I was really impressed with how simple it was to set up the picture quality the video quality the zoom in option image stabilization and the play back quality as well.I recommend this product to any and all who are looking to obtain a quality and inexpensive camcorder for family events capturing images of nature YouTube blogging etc...You can’t go wrong!!!
5,This camera is a great and an affordable option if you are just getting into the whole video creating. It’s even a great gift for a family member/friend who have been at it for a while. It has all of the things you need to make great videos. The zoom is awesome. It fits easily and comfortably in my hand. Stamps are included to decrease risk of it falling and it has two batteries. I love that it was easy to setup and didn't require a ton of reading of instructions. There are a lot of features you can use. It is really lightweight and has cushioned case too. Be sure you have an sd card to get started. Definitely recommend!!!
5,This camcorder is fantastic!!! Super lightweight and compact comes with not one but TWO batteries (love that!) and the ease of use as well as the clarity are outstanding! I have a couple of Kindles and I've been using those for photos and videos but the cameras in them are only 2 megapixels. That is not conducive to taking clear iconic videos or pictures of my cat Gabbigail being beautiful. This camcorder is 24 megapixels! So many features! Like the "smile" mode which will only take a photo when it detects a smile. (You can turn it on or off it isn't always on or anything.) I can't say enough good things about it. And the price for this camcorder is just unbelievable. If they doubled the price I would still purchase this camera. It's that great. Wonderful customer service as well. I recommend getting this 1000%!!!!
4,Fast shipping. So this cam is actually pretty sweet im mainly going to use it as opposed to always taking video with my cell. Cell is always saying low storage and im always having to delete pictures videos and apps from my phone which is frustrating. So ill be using the camcorder to save me from all that. Picture and sound are decent its small and light weight which i like. Came with 2 batteries as well.
5,The video camera camcorder is an Great beginning vlogging camera it shoots Great 1080p film and and photos it’s real easy to use and and extremely Portable and comes with two rechargeable batteries and I got over two hours of recording time on batteries which is great and if you connect it to the computer it also have an webcam feature which also works great and you get all this for an great price in my opinion you can’t go wrong with this video camcorder especially at this price point definitely the best bang for your buck...
5,I have only had it for a few days and I already love it. I did my research to make sure that I was getting a good camcorder that was worth the price and this one was one of the top camcorders sold on Amazon! I absolutely love the small size so easy to carry. And the video is super clear. The sound is a little fuzzy but I read other reviews that say it gets better once you download the video onto a computer. Besides that absolutely love it - highly recommended!
5,I do cooking videos on Youtube.  My old camera was no longer compatible with a Windows 10 upgrade on my computer.  I bought this camera to do my videos.  I basically mount the camera on a tripod and cook in front of it.  I don't need many of the features like zoom and I don't need 1080 p quality.  This camera is just fine for my purposes.  It is lightweight small and easy to use.  My favorite feature is that it does not need extra software to get videos from the camera to my computer:  video clips go directly into my editing program.  I also love that there is a backup battery included and the nice carrying case is a plus.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Love this new camera it gives a 90s feel. I bought this because of TikTok and I love it. The camera quality is surprisingly better than I thought it was going to be. The zoom is decent but I feel like for the money you pay this is a great camera to take with you on summer trips or just with a day out with friends to just make meaningful memories. One thing to remember is to buy your own SD memory card as well or you’ll only be able to take one picture.
5,I was very happy to see that this product comes up with a second battery. The charging was also very quick. It was easy to assemble. The pouch to carry the cam is also very beautiful and very handy. There is also a cable that connects both to USB and RCA so that you can display videos on your computer or TV.  I also bought an storage 32gb and started using the camera. The camcorder is nice and compact. It functions as expected. It has both a video recording and picture mode. The image quality is good for an amateur and proportional to the price point. My mother was asking for a video recorder for a long time. She was very happy to receive this. This is perfect for her to capture her tours and visits to religious places.
4,Great and the size is perfect the for travel!!
4,I really like this camera and for the price it's really good but unfortunately my camera doesn't pick up sound very well. I can deal with this minor mistake but mine could just be defective but if you don't mind that then this is still a good camera.
5,I was surprised by the quality of this camera. I bought this as a gift for my son. It’s  pretty decent for the price.The image quality is great. The camera feels great in your hand. It has physical buttons for all the important functions. The camera is lightweight and sturdy.It was great to see that the camera comes full of accessories: USB cable video cables charger 2 batteries and neat little case.I recommend this camera for people who are starting to learn more about video shooting beyond using a cellphone. It’s great as a gift for kids.
5,Bought this camcorder for my daughter and she absolutely loves it! Definitely a great gift a beginner at filming and editing! I tested out the product and became familiar with all of the functions before handing it off to her. The picture quality and image stability in the light is above my expectations for the price if this camcorder! Night time is a little weak but a light behind the camera or extra light in the shot suffices. The zoom in and out is easy and smooth while controlling.  The packaging was neatly done and and the accessories were packed well organized!
4,It was nice
3,I bought this for my 6 and 9 year old aspiring "YouTubers" It works for their purposes such as taking 90 minute videos of the floor while traveling around the dining roo m in a hover board.. Oh yes and about 120 pictures of the cats butt a soda can the tv and oh  3 of their little sister.  It's cheap enough for them to.run around with and durable enough that it actually survived the first use... As far as quality it's very light the picture is kinda grainy and gets worse the more focused on you get the biggest problem is that it has like no lighting so all videos with normal indoor lighting appear to have a high contrast likea magenta tone to them .. And any rooms with dim or low lighting conditions seem even darker on camera resulting in poor visibility and grainy resolution.
4,I disliked that I had to buy the memory chip.
4,The only drawback is the size otherwise great cam
4,Great product for the price
4,I think the quality is just what I was looking for
4,Very light weight and compact and easy to use. Wish the video quality was a bit better but it's a good deal for what you're getting.
5,First I would like to say that the customer service and concern for my satisfaction are over the top. In today's world customer service has gone to the wayside after most companies get your money that is all they care about. Not with this company at all. I received a prompt email to ensure I was satisfied with my purchase.5 STAR CUSTOMER SERVICE!Second this is a great compact little camera and for the price it can't be beat!  This camera gives the expensive "sports cameras" a run for their money at a fraction of the price. I like that it is small enough to fit in the palm of my hand. It shoots awesome videos with the 32g memory card I installed. I have a trip out of the country next month so excited to start shooting some videos with it.
5,I purchased this camcorder for my 8 year old thinking it was in a good price range for him to learn to use and not worry too much about damaging it. I am actually really surprised at the quality. I started using it too and I have no complaints. It's a great camera for the price and it's easy to use (for a child and a tech challenged adult)The quality of the images/recordings is surprisingly good. It's easy to upload not too cumbersome with too many buttons and features. Perfect for what we need it for.
5,Giving this camera five stars! It looks sleek and has no strange stickers or writing on it...and feels better (heftier) than the first camera I purchased. It doesn’t look or feel cheap. Camera buttons are clear and camera comes with instruction booklet. If you still have trouble getting started Amazon troubleshoot is a great help! Camera comes with TWO batteries which is just awesome. I need to play around more with the zoom but so far so good. Can’t wait for my kiddo to open it on Christmas morning! Will update review once we have a chance to do more.
5,I bought this video camera as a gift for my son for his birthday. It arrived super fast and was well packaged. The camera is small (about the size of my hand) and lightweight. I loved how it came with TWO fully charged batteries. The picture quality is great overall the only thing I would recommend making this camera better is to make the sound louder when you are recording things. Other than that it is an excellent beginner camera and I am very happy with my purchase. :)
5,The display is a little bit off. Have to turn down the brightness while recording. But the person doing the recording has light sensitivity.
5,I purchased this camcorder after one I had received for Christmas broke. I have been very happy with this camcorder. It was much easier to use compared to the other one I had and the video quality so far has been good. I've made two videos so far and uploaded them to youtube. I've been very happy with this purchase so far and hope to keep using it for several years. It's a basic camcorder not too many special options but that is perfectly fine for me. The only thing is that when I walk the video stabilization is a little shaky but again this is a basic camcorder and something I would expect.
5,I was in a hurry to get a video camera as the person who was going to tape my wife doing a presentation on the Equal Rights Amendment cancelled out. I went to Amazon and found this low cost camera I had less than a day to learn how to use it. I already had a micro SD card. We went to the venue and lo and behold there was a camera man there from the local community broadcaster. He was quite interested in my little camera that I carried in my hand along with the tripod.  I had it all setup before the pro got his equipment out of the trunk. All told his commercial camera turned out a video that was almost as good as mine.
4,Bought this camcorder  as an alternate option to a voice recorder for my father to record his diary and it does a good job for what I bought it for and for the price.
5,in order to avoid loss caused by improper use please keep your manual that's first thing I'll start with next going over the book would be helpful as well too. while you're doing that your camcorder can be charging and the manual will tell you how long it takes now it comes with two batteries so when one charges.  the charge will last for a good while so after your finish recharge the battery. now get to know your camcorder /camera and have fun I sure have and I learning how to to do more things with every day and having fun.  pictures and videos come out great only thing you need to get is a memory card cause it doesn't come with it but there not expensive I had an extra one in my camera bag. this would also so  make a great gift for for someone who is getting into photography or videography.
5,I used the video camera for the first time at my daughter's graduation and it was fantastic.  The picture quality was great it was easy to use and because we were sitting in the away from the graduation the zoom feature worked very well.  The camera is small and fits into the palm of your hands comfortably.  My wife likes using her cell phone to record but it was hard for her to hold it steady but with this video camera in the palm of my hand far surpassed the pictures taken by my wife's IPhone ll.  I would highly recommend this product for high and efficient quality.  Very satisfied with the service.
5,This is my first camcorder and it is pretty easy to use. It is good to have as a starter one to see if I will actually use a camcorder regularly before deciding to purchase a more professional one. For the cheap price it is great for home videos and/or to start your YouTube career. I changed the Video Resolution from FHD to HD since the HD option is 30 FPS instead of 15 FPS. After changing to 30 FPS the video was less blurry when there was movement. The camcorder is also very light and small so your hand won't get tired from holding it.
5,For the money you can't go wrong.  I purchased the item in order to document all my household possessions in the case of an insurance loss.  This has  been a project I wanted to complete for several years since moving into a new property and this little recorder gave me that opportunity at a more than fair price.Like anything new the on screen menu display is somewhat confusing but after working with it for a bit  you get used to it.Battery life is about 1.0 hours per battery in continuous record mode.Bottom line its a great little unit for the price and for my basic needs.
5,I am a content creator on YT and I wanted to get a camera that was good enough to record vlogs and reviews while being inexpensive enough to fit within my budget. This camera is perfect! I especially love how the screen can flip all the way around so I can see myself clearly while I am taping. I also am grateful for how easy it is to transfer files directly from the camera.The picture is good enough for what I want to use it for as well. And the weight of it (it is truly lightweight) makes it where I can record my videos and my hand not get tired.Overall I am happy with my purchase and I plan on getting another one when my son starts his content creation project as well.
5,I bought this camera for my 10 year old daughter for Christmas. Her biggest ask from Santa this year was for a “tape” camera. She was able to figure this one out all on her own and uses it all the time. She switches from the video to photo settings all the time. I also purchased a large SD card and she’s yet to fill it up. Great purchase have no regrets and would buy another if the need arises I have a 7 year old who has been eyeing his sister’s camera.
5,This is the 1st camcorder I purchased compared the reviews and ended it this one glad that it fits my need just right!Have been using the camera for a while now the camcorder itself is light weighed and very easy to carry and use. It came with a cover bag to store your camcorder two batteries and some cable wire. **It didn't come with SD card.I used it for a tour of house seeing as I am gathering designing ideas of renovation of my house to video whatever I saw is really important as you can not remember everything after seeing 3 houses or more....My only concern is that the voice is kind of breaking up when trying to play the videos through the camcorder itself...But I guess same rule apply to similar product?For a beginner who wants to try out a camcorder I will recommend this one as it's really easy and simple.
5,I really like the size and ease of using this camera. It's perfect to capture videos for vlogging and small enough to transport and is lightweight. Worked perfect on Christmas morning to capture the moments when my children opened gifts even they used it and asked to get one for themselves. It was with great ease of viewing the video on my laptop with simply using a memory card and no worries about a tape! I would definitely recommend purchasing this camcorder especially if going on vacation day trips or capturing special moments. Awesome camcorder!!
5,I got this camcorder because my 5 year old is interested in vlogging and his videos are taking up too much space on my phone.  The camera is a perfect size- small for one handed use with a good sized screen that can flip around if you want to video yourself and see the screen at the same time.  It came with two batteries and a great little case.  We're excited to use it on our vacation this week-- we'll test out the battery life then.  The only thing I can't figure out is how to zoom while recording but that's not an important feature to me right now.
5,I cannot day enough about this camera/camcorder. For the price it far exceeded my expectations. I purchased this to get started filming videos for some of my music. I’m just getting started filming and posting videos on YouTube and this camera made it easy to do. Just get yourself a memory card and it’s ready to go out off the box. Very user friendly. Plus it comes with a carrying case and extra battery! I was just going to use this to learn but now I will be using it full time. The price point is amazing. You get more that what you pay for it.
5,Even though I prefer a chroma key feature lacking in this model that I can see I really like this camera. It was very affordable for my purpose. It will help me have some zoom options for my simple production to replace my laptop camera for small productions. I want to get a second one for another camera angle. It is easy to set up and easy to use. The picture is clear and I can use a separate lapel mic for direct sound feed. It comes with a spare battery and the life is 90 minutes on both which works well.
5,This camera is perfect for someone who is just starting to vlog take pictures or learn more about editing.This package came with the digital video camera carrying case 2 interchangeable batteries and the charging USB and auxiliary wires to transfer the images/videos you have taken.I love that it has a view finder that can be adjusted so you can see yourself while you're filming yourself.While it doesn't come with a memory card it wasnt a deal breaker for me as memory cards are usually $10 or less and can be purchased from most stores I purchased a 4 pack from Costco for $24.I also added the 3 year insurance/warrant to this camera for an additional $7.99.This was a great purchase for the value and would purchase again!!
4,It's a pretty decent camera for the price (I'm planning to use it to film youtube videos). The picture quality is good the image stability works well and setting the settings is pretty easy. The zoom is a little weak but even at it's highest zoom it keeps pretty good image stability. I'm actually really pleased with it!
3,I would of loved to know before buying this camera required SD card to work. My son was so excited to receive this for his birthday than disappointed when he was not able to use it even for a few quick minutes.
4,I made a video and it got erased. Took some time to figure everything out. I lock the pictures now so they won't erase too! Overall good I messed with settings and found some cool things. Worth the money! JUST A REMINDER: does not come with SD card.
5,With Christmas just around the corner I thought what better gift to get for my husband? We have a growing family and now we will be able to capture incredible moments that we can cherish forever. The camera arrived in perfect condition with all the accessories mentioned. I like how small it is so it will be easy to carry around in my purse or the diaper bag. Everything seems to work perfectly and you can’t beat the price. Overall I am happy with my purchase and hope to get many uses out of it.
3,Edit: spoke withCustomer service and they provided troubleshooting. When product was found to be defective they refunded purchase price.Original Review: Avoid buying unless you want to explain to your children how Sometimes Santa’s elves cross wires while building toys.We received a defective product. The camera completely fails to function.  The only thing it does is turn on.  If you try to start recording or take a picture the screen goes to a green static or solid green.  Manual provides very little instruction and no troubleshooting tips. To further increase the disappointment the advertised product support was just as worthless. The product support specialist only wasted my time and the only helpful thing they did was supply an email address for the vendor.  The vendor has failed to respond to my emails as well. So it seems like a much better product than it is.  100% disappointed.
5,This camera is being used in recording church services. The functionality of this is easy and directions are straight forward.  I may be able to add more when we use it longer but so far it is working great for our use. That use is running directly into a dvd recorder. I have sound coming from our PA system so I cannot speak for the sound quality. We keep it plugged in during recording so I cannot speak to battery life either. Again for our purposes it is great!
4,Was really surprised at this camera bought this for my 12 yr old to do some beginner vlogging. The camera was exactly what we needed for him easy to use and dis not break the bank. This is a beginner camera and will do nicely until one is ready to move up to more advanced model.
5,This camera is dummy proof! I have a podcast that I can now finally launch on YouTube because of this great little camera! Sotally Tober Podcast for anyone interested. I am new to videography and being able to navigate around it effortlessly saves so much time and stress! Growing up Mom and Dad used to film my brother and I lot making home-made videos. I don't know if it is easier to record everything on phones nowadays but the quality and size of the camcorder allows for easy portability. I will be grabbing mom one of these so they can make more home-videos to laugh at in a few years!
5,This little camera was everything my family needed. I first said it would be a trial camera but I've changed my mind. It comes with everything you need in a nice dust case and what's not to love about it being hand sized. Meaning it's not huge and heavy. We love it. The picture quality is sharp as well as well as the volume quality but not as sharp on my tv. May be different for yours. It was a great purchase and all 5 of my family members are happy!
5,Review: my new camcorderI love it! Best camera ever! It arrived so fast I thought it was a dream Lol. It took coffee 4 hours and a green light beam and recording all day till it sank in as real!  I used it at the gym and the office today.  Picture came out great! Then I tried both batteries and 2 different sd cards and the tv plugin with no issues. Recording sound picture quality all passed with flying colors. Great customer service. Can't beat the price!  My recommendation:  I just ordered another one!  ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ -Best Deal Ever!!!-Dr. John Strong
5,I bought this movie to take home videos. As I find it easier to put an SD card into my pc to upload the videos than use my phone. At under $50 the price was just right. The camcorder has worked to my expectations up to this point. The only negative I have found is the zoom is a little bit slow. But I am only shooting home movies so that’s not a big negative for me. The camera is compact and fits in the palm of my hand. It is very easy to use. Just take it out of the box put an SD card in format the card point and shoot! Overall I give this product five stars and would recommend to anyone looking for a simple camcorder for home videos.
2,I like the camera however as it dies too quick only used it 3 times since I bought it waste of money
3,This camera has poor picture quality and even worse sound quality.It also records in a format that seems impossible to convert into something useful.Half the video I take with this thing are just awful and the other half are hard to convert to .mov.The zoom is particularly bad - makes things really grainy.Use an old cell phone.You can get better results.Seriously.Even from a flip phone.
5,This product was very easy to work and definitely worth its price! The picture quality was exactly really good and it did not fail my expectations. The zoom option was very easy to use and is introduced to you in the user Manuel as well as all the other features and how to use them. Image arabization is great. This product is definitely worth the buy and is a great way to reconnect with an old school style of media.
4,Its great does exactly what it says it will do
5,I bought this to take fun home videos of my vacation with friends and it was exactly wjat I expected from this product. Camera is fairly good quality for the price. Sound quality is not great through the speakers on the camera itself but sounds much better after the video is uploaded to a computer. Overall it was exactly what I was looking for and expected out of this camera.
5,For the price this is a great camcorder for beginners. I have a go-pro but that is much more expensive than this. As an amateur camera this has some good features. The image quality is good even if I took pictures for night views. The sound of videos is adequate enough for home videos. The camcorder is easy to hold. The price is perfect for beginners who want to try to take videos without using cellphones.However I need to buy my own SD card and it is hard to remove so I have to use a tweezer. And the anti-shake function  doesn’t work as well as I expected.Overall for people who don't want to spend hundreds of dollars and just want to start to take videos when they are traveling without using cellphones it worths the consideration.
5,This camera is amazing for the price! It has great quality good zoom and it does its job.The only con for the camera is that the audio isn’t super clear. The mic doesn’t pic up sounds very well so when you play it back (on the camcorder) it’s super quiet it’s slightly better when playing back on the computer. Although this is true I bought it to make some home videos so I actually enjoy the bad audio and the blurry zooms. I wanted to have more of an older camcorder feel to my videos rather than some fancy camera that gets every shot in super clear HD.
5,I only owned this camcorder for a day but I love it already! It comes in great packaging with a nice reusable box. I love the fact that it also includes a carrying case that fits perfectly and has auxiliary cords to hook up to a different device as well. There are different modes & settings and the device fits perfectly in your hand. I am looking forward to using this camcorder for family events and vlogging! I have been a reviewer & blogger for some time as well as a Tarot Reader & was looking for the perfect device to expand those services I offer so I am very excited to find the ideal device for all my video necessities!I highly recommend this camcorder to anyone looking for a great value and effective device! 5 stars!😊
5,In terms of quickly picking it up and operating the device I could not beat it. I needed to device for recording athletic events and my team manager was able to throw a battery in and get to work with it without diving through needless instructions simply because of the basic operating system. Picture quality is a little low on large-scale video recording but alongside a mount or good hand the stability is good. Zooming does not add a blur to the image like other cam recorders we have used.
4,It came
5,I needed a camera for my soccer team. I wanted to provide game film for myself and my athletes to break down things we needed to do. This camera allows me to do that and more. It's an easy out of box set up charging is easy the filming is easy and the picture quality for my athletes is great. The uploading is even easier. I was hesitant to buy something like this at the great price point but it has exceeded my expectations and would recommend this product to anybody that wants to do game film for their team or for any one with kids. I currently am recording the life of my brand new twin girls. All in all a great product at a great price. Can't beat that. Thank you!
3,My wife couldn't even hold it in her hand she couldn't see the screen I want to return a Cam coder and case
5,This product came packaged well. One thing I was grateful for was the second battery. Another thing is it comes with the cables to hook it up.  The carrying case is also a nice to have. All in all the package deal was a great price. I was looking for something to start vlogging with and this is definitely doing the trick.  I have mine on a tripod most of the time and haven't noticed any shaking. The hour or two I have recorded outside came up pretty stable. I was running around a bit too. I'd recommend to someone looking for a good starter camera for vlogging.
5,This is a wonderful beginner’s video camera.  It comes exactly as advertised – with two batteries all the cords one needs and a case.  If you follow the instructions and are patient examining the features you will find that it works very well.  I am more than satisfied with the features.  It is very compact lightweight takes 24M jpeg’s at 1080p resolution.  There is a hand strap and a steady cam function that help a lot to make a crisp and steady output.  And talking about output the image quality is very good.  Overall I would recommend this product to beginners and amateurs.  Once they figure out the features they will find out it is really easy to use.  For the price this is an extremely great value.
4,Everything about this camera is great except the sound quality if your looking for a nice portable camera to take pictures though this would be the camera for you. I loved this camera but when I took my fist video I realized how terrible the sound is and I wanted this camera for YouTube videos so I decided to get a different one. but like I said if you just want to take pictures this is a great camera. The picture quality is AMAZING.
5,I bought this video camera mainly for the price and wasn't sure what to expect.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  I like that it has two batteries although the battery life is quite good.  I am impressed with the quality of the picture and the sound and it comes with carrying case cables and the extra battery.  All you need to add is an SD card.  I particularly like the size of the camera fits nicely in the hand.  The controls are easy to use and after only a couple minutes my wife was using it quite skillfully taking movies of our granddaughter.  If you're looking for something to get into instead of taking all your videos on your phone....try this one I don't think you'll be disappointed.
5,I am simply blown away at the quality of this inexpensive video camera.  For the person that wants to explore video creating this is the price point to get into it. It is not a professional broadcast camera but comes with a lot of bells and whistles that you will find amazing. For starters this is a small hand held powerhouse. Very easy to understand and easier to use. The picture and video quality is what they said it would be and I am very happy I selected this product. Give it s shot...you won't be sorry!
5,I got this camera for my granddaughter as a Christmas gift. It is a handsome looking handheld camera which will work perfectly for her smaller hands (she's 7) but also felt comfortable for me. Set up (battery charging-and note you get two batteries so you can always have a backup charged and ready to go and formatting the sd card which I bought separately) was easy. I haven't used the camera much as it's a gift but it appears to have all the functionality you could want and is great value for the price.
5,so I decided to start a Youtube channel during quarantine and I wanted to make it as least complicated as possible. I read the reviews PLUS it was a lightning deal so I purchased this camera. It's SUPER lightweight and cute. It has a lot of settings and the menus are easy to get to and user friendly. I only gave it 4 stars because I haven't actually recorded anything yet and can't comment on video quality but I can already tell this camera is gonna be a blast. I plan to use it to record some moments and when I go visit my nephews.
5,We love that this camcorder had two batteries so one will always stay trite the battery life is actually pretty good you do get good use out of it as it stays charged for a quite a while. I bought this to have something to record videos on that wouldn’t take up too much space in my phone and also for the my daughters to play with as they want to become YouTube stars LOL. We love that the screen flips around so my girls can see themselves and audio is great too!Overall I would definitely recommend to family and friends this camcorder as the price point is spot on and the functionality and performance are great for the price!
5,I am so impressed with this camcorder! My 9 year old had been asking for one to make YouTube videos for a year (I may be the worst parent on earth but it’s set to private he has no clue the 145 views are from him watching himself 😬). I did a ton of reaearch and decided on this one and it’s so easy to operate but at the same time the clearest picture ever. The night light works amazing well and again my 9 year old can operate it with ease. Fantastic starter for any age.
3,I got this for a cheap resort before the holidays so we can start to save our memories of our kids and family. We for sure will be getting a better camera. If there are too many voices going on at once then it will just sound mushed and muffled.  It loses focus often. You can hear when you click the zoom button. But it has done it's job for us so far and we can't complain about that! We will just give this to our kids to play with once we buy a more expensive camera.
5,We purchased this camera for our middle school daughter who wanted to make videos just for fun. We wanted something nicer than kids cameras that are usually pretty low quality and this is definitely better and was even less expensive than what most kids cameras cost. The picture quality is good but if you zoom in and out while filming the picture does jerk a bit. Sound is fine (we have only used indoors) but not amazing. Overall we were looking for a low cost option to use for fun with and this fit the bill. If you are looking for a quality professional camera this is not it but you would need to spend probably at least 4 times this amount.
5,I am absolutely in love with this camera!!! I was super excited when I got it in the mail because I am an aspiring filmmaker and bought this to film my first project. I spent the entire day getting so many different types of shots and putting this thing to the test and I was pleasantly surprised by how well the shots looked! It has many different effects that let you film a multitude of various professional-looking content! I wasn't expecting much of the microphone initially but once again I was pleasantly surprised! The sound quality was beyond anything I could have asked for and my voice was heard very clearly. Once again I love this product and would surely recommend to anyone wanting to film ANYTHING at all!
5,Note:  this camera will be used for home and not professional purposes.Remember when people used to sit around the living room watch home videos and reminisce about the "good ol' days?"  I want to bring that back especially because my family has a sick loved one.  This camera is great at cataloging memories in 1080p and it's able to zoom which is a major plus.  The batteries seem to last a great deal of time and this has really become a terrific purchase!
5,This was a present for my son for Christmas. He loves it and it’s a great starter camcorder. Was very happy with my purchase.The zoom quality is nice and battery life is great. It came with two batteries which I thought was awesome.The quality of the picture is good too.You do need to purchase an SD card to use the camera to store videos on. But with the prices of the camera I didn’t mind doing.Super satisfied with my purchase.
4,Camera looks great. Haven’t used it yet. Lost a star because it got lost in the mail only to come a couple days later
5,I bought this camcorder just to fun around and things you know family videos amateur movie clips and such. Video quality is good  the thing isn't heavy at all and battery life is pretty good also. Charges quickly and I love that two batteries were included. A thing I dislike is the negative effect mode. It's way too bright. I like the B&W mode and Sepia but don't the point in Red Green or Blue modes. Other than all of this it's a good quality inexpensive camorder.Oh wait you'll need a SD card and SD card adapter. 32 Gigs guys and I would recommend a fresh one because you'll have to format a used one.
5,Last year my church had a fashion show for casual and formal wear which my husband and I were in. This year I didnt want to be in the fashion show but was asked to be a photographer and I said yes. I didn't want to use my cell phone so I went on Amazon to look for a camera. I only had little over a week before the fashion show. The last time I bought a camera was years ago and it was huge and bulky. I found this cute sleek and compact camera which was perfect!! After it arrived I learned how to operate it within a matter of minutes that's how easy it was! I am very very happy with my new camera thank you very much!
5,I bought this camera as I have very little experience in recording. After looking at several tutorial videos on how to properly blog and create your own YouTube channel I could not be happier with my purchase. The camera is lightweight very intuitive and very simple to operate. It let me get familiar with key camera terms and functionality that a more expensive camera would have been too difficult to learn. I continue using this camera on a daily basis for Vlogs and quick family snippets. If you're looking for a great low cost and productive camcorder to get started this is the one.
5,I was skeptical but the camera is a really good quality product for the price. Comes with a nice case and is easy to use. just got it and just started to test it out. Nice big screen and the picture is pretty good. I think the sound quality is ok but i have not yet loaded a video to my computer to see if it came out ok.I got this to take video of the kids as they grow up realizing my :30 phone videos wont cut it this item is perfect for that and just general fooling around with.
5,Great Quality in such a little camcorder!  I initially purchased this camcorder for my almost 8 year old son but I am having a great time using it as well!  The price alone is worth buying this camera but the quality and ease of use for myself and my 8 year old makes this camera a steal.  The size is perfect for little hands as well as grown up hands.  I can not say it enough THIS IS A GREAT BUY!!!!!
5,I missed this detail when I ordered so pointing out you will need to have a storage card to use it in case anyone else needs reading glasses but refuses to use them like me.The battery comes charged; that was a nice surprise. Being able to turn the screen around is a fantastic feature. Small enough to fit lightly and easily into all of our hands.If your intention is to do very basic videography to look back on in years to come this will probably suit. As others state this is not for serious hobbyists or professionals. It's helpful to have a separate device for video so that the whole group doesn't have to have their phones out when traveling and get distracted. It's also useful if you don't want to bring an expensive phone on a trip but still want to capture memories.
4,I ordered this to shoot behind the scenes of creative projects as well as just fun home videos and it works great for these uses. The video quality is not anything close to a more expensive camera but I like that it has a more grainy homemade look. The quality looks good in sunlight and I love that it includes the little yellow date stamp in the corner. Very lightweight haven't had any battery issues only took off a star because the zoom is a little delayed
5,Out the box everything listed was inside. Was a lot smaller than I thought but perfect for hand so no complaints just surprised it was so small. Not the best in tech for myself but 1st time camcorder buying im happy with this purchase. Takes photos n video well in well lit n dark areas. Sound could be a bit louder but its good for what the price is. Would recommend.
5,I brought this camera to film some of the things I was doing with my students in the classroom like skits and role playing. The image was pretty great. I was able to zoom in nice and close from clear across the classroom. Even with my shaky hands the image came out beautiful. I didn’t expect a lot because of the price but you get a lot of bang for your dollar.I updated my original review. As I been playing with the different features it has increased my opinion of this camera. I like how you can film in black and white or even in blue. The photo option is a real plus!
5,We bought this for our son for Christmas and have tested the product out first.  The image quality is amazing and the sound quality is great.  It came with 2 batteries and one was already fully charged and ready to use.  (Major plus for a Christmas gift!). It even came with a small case to keep it safe.  I'm overall very happy with this product and we are already considering purchasing another one if this one gets used as much as we think it will.
5,Took this on a cruise to film my family and it worked perfectly! The quality was perfect!  I could not believe how light the camera was! It's so lightweight!  It comes with two batteries and a carrying case.  Its really small but the screen is big enough so you can see your subjects perfectly.It was also super easy to use. It comes with an instruction manual but I didn't really need it because the camera is really intuitive.  It turns on quick and starts filming quickly so you don't have to worry about missing any awesome moments.My family loved sitting down to watch our adventures from the cruise. The quality was perfect and the sound was great!  I'm really impressed with this little puppy.  A great deal for a great camera.  It's so good I'm thinking of starting a YoutTube channel with this!
5,I JUST WANT TO SAY THIS WAS A GREAT PURCHASE. I TOTALLY RECOMEND IT! I wanted something for my son that was not to expensive yet great qualify and that's what I found in this product. Its very easy to set up and use and those 2 batteries are so handy and use full. This is one of his Christmas gifts so I am so happy everything came in on time and I cant wait for him to open it up on Christmas :) thank you again!
5,I like this little camera. I need it for class this semester.I like the fact that you can change the white balance ISO and exposure. It zooms well. It’s nice that it comes with two batteries that way you can change on the go. It’s nice and lightweight and comes with a bag that can attach to your belt.The batteries are partially charged so you can go out as soon as you get it.Additionally the company ships quick. I got it on time and packed nicely and in good condition.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             So when I first bought this camera I didn't know I had to mount the SD card first before using it and the picture you see is what happens when you do not mount the SD card first. DO NOT be alarmed. After I mounted it this camera worked just as the description mentioned. It's cute and little! I take it on every family outing because I want to be able to catch every moment! The picture quality is alright from the camera itself  but when you plug it into the laptop or TV it looks amazing! Do I recommend this camcorder/camera? Absolutely! It is worth it! It does come with it's own little pouch and charger! Not to mention it doesn't take long to charge and the battery life is quite decent.
5,My husband and I purchased this camcorder to have for the birth of our first daughter in a few weeks and to capture many moments in her life (phones are great but there is something wonderful and nostalgic about having the camcorder).It is extremely lightweight and it works perfectly. We have taken photos on it already and a few videos. The quality is great and it is very easy to use!If you are looking for a camcorder to get the job done for a great price this one is for you!
5,I love my new camcorder.  I had been doing videos on my phone and uploading them to facebook etc.  But it was not coming out the way I wanted.  But now that I have camcorder things are going great.  It is small and compact but is a mighty with what it can do.  It has two batteries which really helps.  Love My New Video Camcorder
5,I like that it's compact light weight and the price was affordable when your on a budget. It's a great video cam recorded. I don't like that you must have a memory card for it to record any video. The zoom quality is really good and so it the video stabilizer and good picture quality but it should include a memory card and tripod as a bundle. I bought for my niece as a Christmas gift. I  think I'll buy another one for my daughter
4,Good camera the battery goes dead really fast. I can charge it up at night go try to use the camera the next day and the battery is dead.
5,While I am giving the individual aspects a 4 star over all I rate this a 5 star product for its value. Yes there are products that zoom and have better quality video out there for the price paid they exceeded my expectations. The image stabilization is pretty good as well and on a tripod is as anticipated great. I got this as a gift for my 7 year old. It seemed a little "cheap" during my unboxing so I played around with it to ensure it would stand up and produce good quality videos and I am more than pleasantly surprised at the quality. He will be over the moon and a very happy kiddo come Christmas morning.
5,My wife bought this camcorder to capture our upcoming great-granddaughter's (2 born in June) birthday party in our patio and back yard. She bought it to replace our 10 yr old tape video camera since it no longer works. It was very difficult to transfer videos from the old tape camera into electronic format to burn onto DVD. We love that this camera uses a memory card that is easily removed and transferred to a computer for saving and sharing. She likes the small size of this new camcorder making it easy to hold and use. Overall a nice little camcorder.
5,This is a nice camera I bought it for home movies. I was surprised how compact it was and also happy to see that it came with two batteries. The charging situation is a little odd in that it seems you have to charge the camera itself with battery in it you can't just charge the spare battery while using the camera...but not a major issue.Other than that I like this. The sound isn't the best but it works for home movies the picture is nice and it's simple to use. Can't beat it for the price!
5,I bought this camcorder for my daughter to use to create her YouTube channel. She was so excited to get it. Although I haven’t used it myself to make a judgement call I was happy to see that it came with 2 batteries and the option to recharge with a cord. It’s also very compact and has a nice carrying case. My daughter brings her camcorder everywhere. From viewing the videos she’s recorded the picture quality seems pretty nice. It’s a winner in my book 👍🏾.
5,Great quality packed into a super easy to take with you everywhere size! The camera fits in my hand and is super light. Great picture quality better than expected! Zoom feature works with more clarity than expected as well! Bought for daughter to carry with her to capture on the go vlogging material and is perfect! Shipping was quick as well! Came with 2 rechargeable battery packs wall adapter charging/ audio visual cord instruction manual and case! Great value for the price! Definitely recommend!
5,We LOVE this camcorder! The size is very convenient as it is small enough to fit in my purse to take places. The picture quality is great. It also comes with a backup battery so you jabe one to use and a second to charge for when the first dies. The best part is you can hook the camcorder up to the TV and watch your videos with the family or friends where everyone can see at the same time! Awesome little camera!
4,Product works great in terms of picture quality and battery life (especially for a camera of this price) and is easy to operate
5,I really like this camcorder! It's small lightweight and sleek! Great for little hands it comes with a case that you can put on your belt PERFECT for not losing! I bought it as a Christmas gift for my daughter who wants to be a youtuber. Before purchasing I did tons of research on which ones would be better for a beginner and this was it! I have turned it on and played around a bit it comes with a light attached already but you may need another for filming at night. The picture didn't seem that sharp but I haven't inserted an SD card yet. Overall it's a really nice camcorder I know she's going to LOVE IT!
4,Just got it for bday gift and so far kid loves it!
5,I bought this camcorder for my son and his rise to fame on YouTube. He wants to become a YouTube star and this little video camera does the trick! Its the perfect size for traveling the picture quality is outstanding all the functions work perfectly and the battery life last forever! Plus it comes with an extra battery pack and carry case. I would recommend this camera for someone who wants the most bang for a little bit of buck. You won't be disappointed.
5,The camera is small and light easily fits in the hand .I bought this for sporting events and for training young athletes.I coach track athletes in the throwing events and it is perfect for recording a throw and then showing the athlete on the flip out screen for instant feedback.It will also work on a tripod.  I especially like the small size. A lot of power without a big bulky camera to lugaround.All that for under $70. Amazing !
5,I love how simple this video camcorder is to use! I’ve never owned a camcorder and this one is perfect for learning to operate and put into use quickly. The picture quality is AMAZING! I don’t even want to use my iPhone to take pics anymore so I carry my video camcorder with me all of the time. It’s compact and super convenient for storing in my purse. And the videos look way better too! You cannot beat the price either. Don’t hesitate... BUY IT!!!
4,Zoom and image stabilization very good quality compared to my $500.00 Sony camcorder I had before
5,I bought this camcorder for my brother as a graduation gift and he loves it. He has an interest in movie making so I thought this would be a perfect gift for a 14 year old boy. It was ready to go straight out of the box and very easy to read instructions. It needs an SD card bit comes with everything else like battery charger and connection to watch on tv and even a case for it. It's compact and lightweight which is perfect to carry everywhere. I would highly recommend this for any age. Great quality and great price.
5,Absolutely amazing camera for the price!! If you are looking for an affordable camcorder with a vintage picture quality feel this is the camera for you! I especially liked the zoom feature as it has a very smooth zoom and the long lasting recording to record time lapses! It transfers over to a computer super smoothly and is a great camera to have fun with and carry around in a pocket especially for younger kids!
4,This was purchased for a a gift. It was easy enough to use direction booklet is not clear on somethings. But all and all for the price it is a great deal.
3,This video camera was a good buy for my 5 yr old for christmas but if it's for an adult I wouldnt recommend. Kind of cheap which is what I was looking for so it surved its purpose! If my 5 yr old broke it it wo UK ldnt be a big deal. I did like that it came with 2 batteries and the little case it has. It's all in all decent for a child who wants to pretend they are making YouTube videos!
2,THE CAMERA OVERALL IS OK BUT WE USE THIS IN A WORK SETTING AND NOTED THAT EVERY 34 MINUTES OF CONSTANT RECORDING THE CAMERA STOPS RECORDING AND STARTS BACK OVER STILL RECORDING. IT DOESN'T CONTINUOUSLY RECORD EVEN THOUGH 4+ HOURS IS SHOWING AVAILABLE ON SD CARD. HIGHLY ANNOYING.... OTHERWISE IT'S A DECENT CAMERA - BATTERY LIFE IS NOT GREAT AND HAS TO STAY PLUGGED IN TO OUTLET. THANKS
3,The initial camera I purchased was defective. The zoom wouldn’t work the screen would blank out and turn green or static and the battery would have to be removed to shut it off. It is really light weight- makes me worried it will easily break (feels like it’s made of plastic).  The photo quality is poor but I didn’t buy it for that. The video quality is ok. Better than what I had but not as clear as I had hoped reading the reviews. I mostly got it for my kids to make YouTube videos so for the time being it will function for it’s purpose. I will purchase something better down the road. Amazon did let me send this back and issued a replacement.
3,For the price I guess it's ok
4,USB cable connection should on the back or other place not next to the screen. The mic should be isolated with soft rubber or a jack for remote mic.
5,So I ordered this to keep in the summer mood and I gotta say I love this camera so much. It was complicated to fit the SD card in but once I watched some videos and read the instructions I got it working. The audio at times isn’t the best but it captures everything amazingly. As someone who loves documenting and photography this was a great addition to my camera family.
3,I like the size of it. I was surprised that it came in a small carrying case. Nice touch.But frankly it's just a toy. The picture is not very good the zoom is jumpy and clunky and the unit is designed to interface ONLY with Windows operating systems. But of course that tidbit of information was not in the description. I will return immediately.
4,I originally thought I had received a defective camera because I kept seeing a "green screen" every time I clicked 'record.' However I looked through other reviews to see if anybody else had similar problems. I saw that the seller replied and I followed the advice to go to the 'menu' click right scroll down to function then click 'yes.' Camera worked fine after! Only other problem I found was that the "zoom" isn't very smooth! But I love the LED night lighting and how you can change the video 'frame'! Perfect for small little videos 4 fun or if you're into the 2000's video look.
5,This camera was purchased due to it's various functions sleek design and extra battery. Little did I know that it would take such pristine video on the first day we tried out we were going a bit fast in the turning so the camera adjusted and slowed the turning motions down to make it easier on the visuals of the video what a nice feature the colors captured are a broad scheme of colors and being that it is all digital make it even that more great I am in awe by this cam corder and you will be too.
5,We ordered this camera for our 9 yr old daughter who has started making videos during the quarantine.  I was a little worried that it might be too complicated to figure out seeing as how my tech knowledge doesn't extend beyond use of my iphone however I was pleasantly surprised!  The directions are easy to follow and all buttons are marked nicely.  Our daughter has not needed help at all and the quality is great!  Another bonus I wasn't expecting? The batteries come charged so you can start enjoying the camera as soon as you get it!
5,I bought this camera to take pictures of my cat when we play "Hide and Seek."  She is a stray I adopted and a lot of fun. I have been wanting a camcorder for a long time. I asked Alexa to recommend one and she said this one. She is right. This one fits my hand well and is easy to operate as I have arthritis in my hands and do have problems holding things. This one has more features than I was looking for or expected so I know I got a good buy. In turn I highly recommend this camcorder...and the price is right. Thank you for a great buy and quality product.
4,The first one I received the zoom was broken and didn’t work. Unfortunately due to this we missed capturing our daughters first Christmas on video as we returned it. The replacement we did receive and everything works as it should. We just want to set this in a corner in the house and capture some of those precious moments. Lighting is very important as video will be dark majority of the time even with the light turned on.
4,Such a great camera for us who are new to the world of digital recording. It's so easy to get going and the quality is great.  I am not good at taking pictures and even worse with making movies but I think that this camera is so easy that you can make great movies withn a few minutes of taking it out of the box
5,I think this camcorder was overall very good! It is a good size and easy to carry around with a secure pouch that comes with the purchase. The camera function is also really good the image quality is clear for a camcorder but still gives a camcorder vibe! It was what I was looking for! It came quickly and with batteries - make sure to separately order a SD card!
4,The unit does a decent job recording videos. The sound quality is o.k.I realize this is not an expensive video camera but it really feels cheap.I don't think it's very durable but time will tell.
5,I have been looking for a decent and really handy Camcorder for a long time. Found it at last on Amazon and was using it within a week of order placement. I live very near a golf course almost on it and we are lucky to be visited by many South Florida birds both for feeding and nesting. Took the camcorder camera out twice to video charming activities of migratory as well as local birds feeding in the lakes and on the open grasses. It was wonderful to watch the birds and even more satisfying to view the excellent quality of pictures on my laptop. Zoom and stability were very good as described by the seller. Very happy with the great little camcorder.
5,Oh my goodness! This thing is so tiny and fabulous! We got it for our boys so they would stop asking for our phones to film all of their little videos and they have been using it nonstop! Thankfully it comes with two batteries! LOL LOVE this little video camera! Even my 6 year old operates it like a pro! We’ve been watching a lot of the Goldbergs with them and they wanted to by like Adam and I’m glad it gets them off the screen/video games  and creating some awesome family videos!
5,I was worried that I would not know how to use this camcorder been a long time since I had used one. Its really compact easy to carry and very easy to use. I like how small it is I can even carry it in my purse. I didn't like that it does not come with an SD card but I had one lying around  I think a lot of people have SD cards anymore so that really wasn't a huge deal. My son was there when I received the camcorder and he basically took it over lol He liked it a lot too. I have been showing my 8 year old granddaughter how to use it and she enjoys it as well. Glad that I have it :)
5,Bought this as a gift for my younger brother because he loves to make videos. So far he has loved using it and hasn't had any issues at all. Its perfect for him making him sketches and using it to upload them to youtube.
5,This camcorder is an awesome product at an awesome price!  It is easy to use very light and compact.  Takes amazing video and still photos!  It's like two great cameras in one!  It even comes with an extra rechargeable battery so you never have to worry about running out of battery life.  It is so compact that it fits in my pocket yet it has the same quality has a much larger more expensive camcorder.  I am definitely pleased with this camcorder and will recommend it to family and friends!
5,I really like this camcorder. It is very easy to use and I especially love that you can take photos as well. I do a lot of fishing and this camcorder comes in very handy. It allow me to take videos when fish are near the boat because I can turn turn the screen 90 degrees and record the action via video or by photo. I also love the fact it compact light and I am able to catch all the action. It also easy to post everything to your Facebook account. Thanks for making a great product.
5,This is an incredibly great camera.  The size is small enough to carry wherever you go.  The quality of the video is excellent.  It comes with 2 batteries that charge pretty fast so you will have plenty of video time.  I was truly surprised at how many good features could be packed into a small camera at such a great value.  I would definitely recommend this camera for everyone who has a budget and does recreational video.
5,I ordered this video camera to tape my daughter's basketball games so I wouldn't waste the battery on my phone. I wasn't expecting much since the price was so cheap. I am very impressed with the quality of the camera. It is very lightweight and comes with a carrying case and 2 batteries. The picture quality is also great and it updates the photos to your computer very easily. I am super happy with this purchase.
5,Ok so I give this an overall 5 star. Why it's cheap. It records it also takes pictures that was a surprise I missed that one lol. The picture quality on the screen isn't HD. The zoom isn't all that great. The flash/light is very small mostly for looks. But it works and its cheap. A great first time camera to learn and use. If you have high expectations then just spend the cash to get the high end one
5,I bought this camera for my 5th grader.  Menu options are intuitive and easy to understand image stabilization and zoom work well for his level of skill and video quality is good as well.  The additional backup battery really comes in handy and they arrived fully charged so he could get started right away.  The only thing that took some getting used to was using the physical buttons for the menu (not a touchscreen).  Overall we're happy.
5,Our daughter constantly been borrowing our phones to create various videos so we thought "why not get her a camcorder for Christmas?". I have never heard of this brand so I was a little unsure. But we are very satisfied with our purchase. The image quality is very good the battery keeps charge for an acceptable amount of time and my daughter is enjoying the camera! Only thing I wish is that it had a remote control.
4,nice little camera very pleased...The only really complaint I had is the mic it works well but does not pick up more than 10 ft clear wish the mike was a little better...but over all I like the camera easy to use great picture and I think you will be happy with the purchase. Would have given it 5 stars on everything except for the mic...i am going to buy a better mic for it but for 100 bucks you can't beat it...I recomend getting a tri-pod stand though.
5,I was honestly so surprised with how well this camera works. Like the description says it's not professional by any means but overall it's great! It feels nice in hand and is smaller than traditional camcorders. The size is great because it's light to carry around and could fit easily into a purse or backpack without requiring you to leave the rest of your belongings behind. It's also easier to handle than smartphone cameras because you only need one hand to film. What's also nice is that it's not so expensive that you'd cry if you lost it and it's not so cheap that you cry at the picture quality. The picture quality though not professional by any means definitely gets the job done. Overall I give this camera a 5 star rating!!!!
3,Picture quality poor
5,It was a little hard to maneuver at first but I got the hang of it . Can’t wait to use it!! Also it does NOT come with a memory card so pls get one before purchasing I got the SanDisk 32GB ultra SDHC card
3,Love the utility of this camera but the batteries it comes with do not hold a decent charge and the interfacing involved in uploading media from it is clunky. Getting photos from the sd card to my hard drive is simple and easy enough but the video exporting only in .AVI has difficult collateral (high disk usage difficult to work with and edit etc.) Definitely fine for obtaining raw footage but it gets frustrating when you try to edit anything you record with it.
5,This camera is super easy to use. It's perfect for when you're hanging out with your friends and want to record the moment. It's fun having videos on something other than your phone! I just throw it in my bag and go. The sound is a little fuzzy from the camera speaker but once you upload the footage to a computer it sounds fine :)
5,This camcorder really surprised me! When I ordered it i ment to use it as a smaller more manageable camera when filming in rough terrain but it ended up being my go to camera for a long time. Picture quality is solid and it's truly user friendly. The image stabilization was a god send when I'd find myself on unstable terrain. The zoom produced a way better picture then I expected from a camera this price. I'd recommend this camera for anyone who needs an affordable vlogging camera. It's pretty tough too I've dropped it a few times and it's still holding up great. For the price you can't beat it!
4,Pic quality ok and video clear enough. Overall nice little camcorder to film kids just havin fun or events! Hooks up to TV fast to watch your videos.
4,I love the Camcorder however it’s not charging and i have to keep ejecting and inserting the memory card but other than that it’s okay.
5,This digital camcorder as advertised is a perfectly suitable camera for children who are learning photography vlogging doing movies or just fooling around on a family picnic.  Its five stars are largely for the value to price ratio.  I found the quality of the video (especially in the bright sunlight of daytime) very good.  The zoom feature is great and easy to use with just a push of a lever.  It is also easy to pause and resume.  The audio quality is not comparable to that of the video.  Basically this is a good starter video camera and a fun piece of equipment that does what it needs to do without being a costly investment.
5,Love LOVE this camera! It’s super simple which is ideal for me. Very easy to switch from photo to video. Playback is very easy and hooking up to tv or computer or charging battery takes me 15 seconds. It’s small and is not clunky or heavy in my hand. It is a size kids or adults can use. The HD clarity is as good as I’ve ever seen. If you want a compact light good quality camera that is relatively inexpensive to definitely VLOG or take on vacation to a party or doing projects for work or school this is in my opinion the perfect camera. Everyone in my fam wants to use it now instead of their phones hah!
5,I was really impressed with the size of the camera. Fits right in my hand. The quality of the pictures and videos is impressive for my liking. If I could make two suggestions: (1) the product contents should contain a memory card. I didn’t like the fact that I had to go and buy separately. I couldn’t use it right away. (2) The product handbook should have a larger print. I had to use a manifying glass to read the instructions as well as learn the parts of the camera.
5,I figured for the price I could not go wrong.  All the reviews said it was a very good buy for the money and the quality is exceeded my expectations.  It is easy to operate.  The picture quality is very good and the image stabilization feature does a nice job of keeping the video steady.  It even comes with 2 batteries which hold a charge for a long time.I would highly recommend this video camera to anyone.  The only drawback is the sound isn't the best though it is not bad.
5,I got this camera as a Mother’s Day gift from my husband and OMG it is all I wanted and more. Arrived really quickly and came with everything to get started just had to grab an SD card. Perfect size and the case and batteries work great! There is nothing like taking home videos from a camcorder rather than a cellphone. This product is perfect for home videos easy enough to use that my children have been recording each other. The memories that I will get from this great camera are more than worth the price.
5,Camera came fast and without any damage. I turned it on just to see how it work and so far it seems decent. Certainly not high end by any means but it’s a fun camera for the kids to make little videos with. Zoom seems to be a digital zoom so things can get a little grainy if used to much.
5,I think this little camera is a great little purchase!! I got this camera to see what it could do... I mean it’s only a $60 camera so I didn’t have my hopes up too high. But I was pleasantly surprised by how well it did on full light conditions.I was also very happy to see the accessories that the camera came with. Two fully charged ready to go batteries. A charging cord. An awesome little carrying case!! What a great little camera.To get started today buy this guy and also buy a memory card! That’s it! Shoot like a pro on a mini-budget until that YouTube money starts rolling in!
4,The specs tell you what you need to know about it’s capabilities. It’s an entry level camera that performs in 1080 resolution. The package contains everything you need except the memory card to store data. The camera fits nicely in my hand and is lightweight. Controls are pretty easy to use and audio recording is acceptable. It is not an upscale camera obviously but nor do they market it as such. So for a basic camcorder it performs its job nicely. My only wish is that it came with a memory card included.
5,We bought this little camcorder after watching some home movies from our childhood and wanted to replicate the experience for our future kids. Great little starter camcorder zooms in picture quality is great for the price you pay and it fits right in my purse so it's not clunky like the old school ones. Takes up to a 32 GN SD card make sure you get one since it doesn't come included. Would buy again!
5,Made this purchase for my teenage daughter she loves capturing memories wherever she goes. The quality of the film is nice and clear the size fits perfectly in her hand she loves that the frame flips around and has a convenient carrying case. Customer service was great when we needed to replace the camera due to a factory defect. I would highly recommend this purchase.
3,I wrote a review it's OK I tried the webcam hook up with windows 7 and windows 10 neither work as a webcam just a basic one that you have to import with the cable or the card forget about using it as a webcam I got 4 that are older just buy a better one with better full features this one I through on the pile of old webcams
1,Took a while for me to unbox I was a little skeptical because I had that "Too good to be true feeling" ..turns out I was right!This product (which felt like a toy even the batteries felt like i could BITE and crack open like sunflower seeds) was supposed to be used for my FIRST family vacation EVER. I was so excited to record all the pre planning road trip and activities (reality tv style!  lol) confessions bounus footage..etcThe directions seem to be TRANSLATED  to english there is button combo's you need to know in order to get the proper function/feature you looking for.I'm a mom not a gamer!Even AFTER looking up video's on youtube to see if it would help I still wasn't any closer to recording.Thinking I might have made some headway (just the basic record) no other funtion The wide and tight button just stopped working I had enough I put it back in box and that's where it still is!I wouldn't even suggest for a kid that would be cruel and unkind.Save your money.Btw..I bought a Gopro learned how to use and started recording in the nick of time!
4,The only dislike would be it doesn’t work without having a me with card
3,We were looking for an inexpensive option to stream through a laptop rather than an ancient iPhone that is prone to crash midstream.This has the feel of a basic webcam that can also write to an SD card. If that is the level you need then this is a good option.I was able to get it to work fine with Windows 10 but not an old Windows 7 laptop.Update:After using it in webcam mode to stream a presentation a few more thoughts:This sucker has a very noisy CCD chip.Zoom does not work in webcam mode.Any control over the image is gone in webcam mode.
5,I just got my new Vlogging camera and I'm looking forward to making some great videos to help my students. The camera is small and intuitive fit my new tripod perfectly and started right up when I put the battery in place. It is so small and light-weight that I will be easily able to take it with me on hikes into the woods so that I can share nature with my science students. I'm looking forward to downloading my videos and making some dynamic lessons this fall.
4,The product was surprisingly well built for the price. The additional protection plan offered was very affordable and gave some nice peace of mind as well. Daughter loves it.
5,I wanted this camera so I can have my own family home videos just intentional special little videos that I'll cherish someday. It's perfect! My iPhone has more crisp quality for it's videos and I actually wanted something that was a little more grainy looking and I nailed it! It's light and easy to hold. I also really like the little light on it!
5,It is very  small fit in your pocket. shoots well even in low light. Only dislike is where the charging port is . you have to open the screen and it plugs in next screen a little tight. best location would have been on the bottom or near or on battery. came with 2 batteries and carrying case. but you have to provide your own sd card. for some reason amazon is not allowing me to upload video. You will need an SD card for it but I got a cheap 64GB one for $11. It comes with two batteries so you can have good on-the-go battery life. To charge the batteries they have to be in the camera while you charge. It comes with the charging cord and usb plug converter. Great Little camera
4,Great item for the price. Easy to use.
5,Bought this for my 9 year old daughter for an early Christmas present.  She absolutely loves this and has found it very easy to operate.The video quality is better than I expected and is perfect for beginners. She mainly uses during the day and picture quality is exceptional. When it comes to nighttime I would suggest more lighting to record.Overall very well pleased with the product and wonderful customer service.
5,I was surprised by the quality of this camera. I bought this as a gift for my soon . My son love this  camera However it is pretty decent for the price.The image quality is great. The camera feels great in your hand. It has physical buttons for all the important functions. The camera is lightweight and sturdy.It was great to see that the camera comes full of accessories: USB cable video cables charger 2 batteries and neat little case.I recommend this camera for people who are starting to learn more about video shooting beyond using a cellphone. It is also great as a gift for kids.
5,I bought this video camera to start vlogging and I did not want to spend a lot of money not knowing how successful I will be with my new found hobby.  The camera is easy to hold in the palm of my hand to keep steady while I record.  The video is decent quality.  Although the sound quality is not bad I will purchase a bigger microphone.  The camera also its looks sharp. Well worth the purchase!
5,I loved the camera quality when I took it outside. Although it doesn't do too well in low-light scenarios it is so easy to handle and the zooming capabilities really come in handy. I could keep it anywhere because of the tripod mount on the back. My only issue was that it was a little hard to put the sd card in and take it out. Other than that a amazing product.
5,I ordered this product for my husband as a hunting camera. We are too tech savvy and this product was really easy to use. I am impressed with the picture quality and the extremely fast shipping. The batteries included as well as not only 1 but 2 batteries was a major plus for me as well as the previous reviews. The reviews were the main reason I bought the product. I would definitely recommend this product.
5,I used the camera over the weekend to record a day trip. Not only did the camera exceed my expectations but it made the trip even more memorable. The battery lasted all day and the camera was very easy to use and is user-friendly. The picture is also great quality and makes recording a breeze. One note: you have to provide an SD card so make sure to purchase one before use. If you are looking for a small handheld camera that is high in performance for the money this is definitely the way to go. Great to carry around all day and not too heavy. I would also recommend a camera bag to carry the charger and extra battery in as well when not in use.
5,When I first started up the camera I had doubts about the image quality. It's been a long time since I've used a video camera. Once I opened the SD card (which you will have to buy separately) and watch my recorded videos on my laptop I was really happy with the image quality. My boyfriend was also impressed especially considering how light-weight compact and affordable the camera is. It's definitely worth every penny and very easy to use. I'm having a lot of fun with it and learning a lot as I go.
4,Le agrado a mi hijo
5,I wanted something that I could just record memories on! wasn't looking for anything fancy or flashy but this is perfect. Easy to use easy to upload to my computer and the image is good enough for me. It is clear gives me 90's camcorder feels. It is really easy to setup and probably would be great if you're just looking for another way to make and save your memories.
5,Bought this for my daughter and she loves it! The only thing was that it was a little difficult to format the SD card we tried first. It was used in another camera then we tried a different one and it worked.  Also the directions were unclear about how to charge it but it wasn’t too hard to figure out.She’s only had it for a month but so far we’re satisfied.
5,I actually like the video camera it’s a great start for beginners! It’s easy to use have a great lighting flash light can take videos and pictures also can learn the camera real fast but you  just have to also get you a Memory card so you can save your pictures !Thank you guys for the extra spare battery the video camera is awesome I like it a lot..
5,I wanted a small camera for not too much money  I just use it to make short videos from my products to post them on my own shopping page -- in just a few days since I have the camera I was able to create all the videos I needed -- and have good success with it. I like that it is possible to copy the recordings direct from the sd card (without to remove it from the camera) to my computer which is very convenient
5,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas because she wants to start her own YouTube channel. I took it out of the box upon arrival and turned it on. The picture quality is really good and there’s even a beauty option to enhance the quality of the video. I bought this not with high hopes but I am pleasantly surprised. Great deal ! I know she’s going to love it just as much as I do.
5,I bought this camera for a family event and moments and Let me tell you... it was an huge success. The quality was more than what I expected for the price. The features like Zooming in and out and the swivel viewing screen makes record from a tripod amazing. The menu properties are clear and easy to navigate . This camera is so small and dainty in its case I can carry it on my next vacation.  Truly a great buy would recommend this product to anyone look for a decently priced video camera.
5,Love this product ! First and foremost I order this product with intention or having it by the following week. To my surprise I got it exactly at 8am the following day!! The camera is sleek user friendly and has almost all the options I need to record videos. My mother passed away and would record videos all the time I wanted to follow her tradition which is why I ordered this product. It is cost effective and worth every penny !!
4,I liked it the quality is average and the sound is low but when I opened it on the computer it was normal.
5,Very reliable easy to charge and use nice little case comes with it.
5,PERFECT for our tween who was begging for a camera. She is THRILLED. It’s lightweight it’s easy to hold in her hand easy to use she understands the user guide without a lot of help she takes care of it and it gives the impression that it’s a lot pricer than it actually was which I believe will help her remember to be careful with it. Easy to pop a memory card in there and go. I’m sure we will end up with some pretty memorable footage out of this camera.
5,I am a clinician and was looking for something to utilize for educational purposes within the program I work for. This device works perfectly and picks up great sound. I can set it up far from the speaker and it will capture clear video and voices. Videos upload quickly to my computer and retain good quality. I have only had it for a brief time and have not experienced any problems.
5,This camera is a perfect starter camera for my 10 year old. It has been great for videos during the day or night as well as "action" videos (my son likes to use it while riding on his skateboard).  It has darkness/brightness adjustment as well as a built-in LED light. My son also enjoys the color effects - B/W red blue. It has been fun & easy to use; excellent camera for the price!
5,It is indeed a nice camcorder for the price. It's light-weighted and supports HD video. It came in nice and high quality white case. The video and photo resolution is great for the price. Easy to carry to travel. It comes with two fully-charged batteries. As the product describes it doesn't come with a SD card but it is very easy to get one.  Overall it is a great product for personal use. I am very happy I got this camcorder.
5,Absolutely the best! This product is easy to use and very self explanatory! I got this a week ago and I am very satisfied! I would like to say I had a slight problem with the directions of which way to put the storage card in but other that amazing product I would totally recommend you to buy! The battery lasts quite a long time and charges pretty darn fast! The camcorder fits perfectly into my hands and is very comfortable to hold! This 100% a review you can trust!
5,I received my camcorder today. It came in very high quality packaging and came with a very nice case as well. It also came with two batteries and the adapter cable to plug into a TV. I used it quite a bit in both 720p and 1080p modes and even took some pictures. For the price you pay for this camcorder your getting quite a package. The audio is a little rough but I can still hear everything and comes in clear with a little bit of static. The image is great for the price you pay for this camcorder and is overall a great product. It feels very sturdy and has pretty good stabilization as well. Great product for the price.
5,Camcorder was more than expected. Pleasantly surprised with quality of this camcorder for the price. Comes with all the gear needed to get started including charger usb cable extra batteries and carrying case. Super easy to use. Seems to be the perfect size with physical buttons in convenient places. Can connect to computer or TV for videos still pics or streaming. Able to connect to tripod for those times when you need a steady shot. No issues with video quality or sound. Perfect for everyday use.
5,I don’t usually write reviews but I can definitely say I am satisfied with buying this camcorder! It’s the first one that I’ve ever owned and right when I got it I loved it!! It’s simple easy to use and i don’t have to worry about losing anything because I accidentally go and delete it off my phone.This is such a blessing to have this and something so reliable especially to record the special moments that my family and I will have I the future.Thank you so much for this!
4,It's okay. Got it for Christmas for my son. He loved it. You get what you pay for. I wish the voice volume was better. Overall satisfied!
5,This camcorder was purchased as a gift for my daughters 10th birthday. She has recorded so much we had to purchase a bigger SD card. The video quality is great very east to use. We had a very expensive $200+ camcorder about 5 years ago that was not as good as this camera. Would recommend for other buyers interested in a good quality lower cost camcorder.
5,I purchased this camcorder after a coworker of mine told me about it and I am so glad I did! For the price you pay you can’t beat the quality or the accessories it includes. Just buy a memory card and you’re good to go! I am so excited to capture my daughter’s life and be able to hold onto these memories without breaking the bank. I highly recommend this product and will likely be buying one for my sister for Christmas!

5,Esta fue una compra de la cual no me arrepiento. Buscaba algo liviano y práctico que estuviera al alcance de mis manos con facilidad para documentar los momentos especiales junto a mi familia y para mí esto es todo lo que estaba buscando. Recomiendo la compra a las familias que desean al igual que yo un equipo a muy buen precio y que pueda cumplir con la función de grabar fácilmente el día a día.
5,Estoy muy contenta con la compra. Es muy facil y practica de usar solo la abres la prendes y le pones el modo que usted gusta video o camara.Yo la compre para hacer grabaciones familiares. Por que todo momento es especial y digno de ser recordado una sonrisa un buen acto ocurrencia o alguna travesura.No se necesita ser profecional en la tecnologia con esta video digital esta echa para cualquier alcanse posible hasta un niño puede usarla y grabar.Estoy muy contenta con mi camarita :) y lo mejor estuvo al alcanse de mi presupuesto $$
5,this camera is lightweight brings all the cables needed and will be good for me to start filming little instances and occurrences in my life.  my hand fits nicely and the strap is adjustable it is also compact and comes with a case so it fits nicely in even a small purse. i would recommend this camera i bought it as a start off for filming just nice things in daily life and to make videos with. i think it is good for this.
5,You could probably count the very few times that I left a product review. This camcorder is a life saver! I purchased it because the camcorder we have been using for awhile had suddenly stopped working. Since its the holidays buying a new camcorder was not on the budget so I looked and checked amazon for new camcorders and this item showed up. I was skeptical at first because it was so affordable but when I was very satisfied as to the quality of the video and audio of this camcorder. It was also very user friendly as well. I highly recommend this!
3,The camera looked good and worked right out of the box. I inserted the battery and Card and formatted the card. The directions were clear and easy to follow. The video of the camera was clear but the sound quality was very poor. The sound was all muffled at a distance of less than a foot and you could hear sound from a distance of 20 ft or more but you could not make out what was said.I needed  to use this  camera for  cooking demonstration videos and the  sound quality was so bad that using this camera for anything other than a toy for a ten year old would surely be a big disappointment.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This video camera is perfect for a beginner video editor or YouTuber.  It is straight forward to operate.  Which is a good thing because the instruction booklet that comes with it is pretty minimal.  Fortunately there is instruction that can be found online.  The picture quality is very good as long as you hold pretty still.  There might be an anti shake control but I haven't found it yet.  After only a few days of using this camera I am really happy with it.
5,Awesome camera! Went to the hairdresser Thursday and she showed me hers. When I got home immediately ordered. Received it that next morning about 7:30. Fits in the palm of your hand and so easy to use!The zoom works at the click of the button on the top of the camera so it's easy to manipulate. Great picture quality and my hand isn't the steadiest but the picture quality is excellent!
5,Bought for an 8 year old. She is happy happy happy! Easy to control. Has playback features and is perfect for her little hands.
5,I bought this for my daughter so she can be a blog beginner. I think it's the perfect gift for her so use for a first time camcorder owner. It fits in the hands nicely the buttons are all intact. I especially love that it came with two batteries and a case!  Also the little swivel can turns the whole 360° ... Definitely recommend for the price! Pretty cool cam!
5,I bought this for a gift for my daughter so wasn't planning on messing with it a whole lot.  I did open it up to make sure everything was working.  Comes with 2 batteries which is awesome and a case.  Zoom feature is easy to use display spins around so you can see the screen from both sides and there aren't a ton of buttons to have to figure out.  Overall it looks great.
4,I bought the camera for my 8 year old granddaughter and she liked it.  What I was not too happy with was the User's Manual as it did not help in the set up or use of the camera.
5,This has been a perfect addition to my equipment for my radio show/podcast. It is compact...which is great. I can fit a very powerful camera in to my backpack. The set up was really easy. I pulled it out of the box and was up and running in minutes. I also liked that it came with 2 batteries. 1 goes dead..you can change it out and keep moving. I think it is perfect for people that do YouTube. You can shoot HD quality video in a matter of moments.
5,The camera was purchased as an inexpensive replacement to my previous unit. It came well packaged with 2 batteries. One of the batteries will not charge but not too much of a concern for me as I only need it fro about 20 minutes to record a wedding. It seems to be an effective camera and fairly simple to use although the instructions could be a little more inclusive.
4,Great little inexpensive camera and worked great with my Mac.  Direction are awful just muddled my way through.  So far so good.
5,I was so happy with the camcorder.  I was asked to make a video of myself to be used in an upcoming event.  They said I could try and use my phone but since this was to be public I wanted it to be better than my phone.  The camera worked so well... I was very happy with the results.  and the small size is perfect for me to bring with me.
4,Bought this because my 11 year old daughter loves to make videos and vlog however she as about as responsible as an 11 year old girl. In other words this is good beginner HD video camera. It has put up with her abuse for the many months now and is still working and I don’t cringe if she drops it.
5,Great camera however this camera does not come with an sd card so if u olan to unwrap it and start vlogging or videoing you want be able to do that because it will constantly say memory full however you cans still take pictures. The onky thing i dont like is it doesnt say it did not come with sd card or have to have one until you open ip the camera otherwise everything else is good to do what you need to do
5,This camera is small enough to carry it anywhere. The batteries last a long time and it is easy to use with the camera's easy functions. I would recommend this product to anyone. My wife loves it as she misses the good ole days when her parents use the video camera on holidays birthdays family gatherings etc... She carries it in her purse and never misses a nice moment.
5,I’m very pleasantly surprised with this camcorder and it’s overall quality. I got this product to take dental pictures for cases we have to send to labs and for orthodontic patient’s before and after pictures. It overall captures good quality pictures and is very comfortable to handle. The one thing you have to buy separately is the SD card which was $11 or so. I’m pretty content with the camera overall and like the case and the extra battery it comes with to protect the product and quickly switch batteries if needed in between patients. I look forward to even putting together videos of the office for our Christmas party!
5,I really have loved using this camera. It is perfect to fit in my purse and easy to use. My boys are growing so fast so I am trying to capture all these little moments before they are gone so I can watch these moments later. This video recorder is great. It has a spot for my memory card and I like that it is rechargeable instead of having to buy batteries. Cannot wait to use it this weekend for recording Santa Claus! With all the bags I will be carrying I am so glad this is so light weight. It is perfect for travel.
5,Hello.  I used the camera on a tripod to start and the quality of the video was perfect.  Then I walked around the house to get a record of all the work done this year.  A little issue with stabilization however it was my fault and is a learning curve.  Bottom line - so far it is excellent at a great price also!C.

5,If you are looking for an affordable option for a good quality camcorder this is the one! For under $70 this is SUCH an amazing deal. It comes with everything you need minus an SD card which you can EASILY get on Amazon for super cheap. The warranty/protection plans are very affordable ($6 for 2 years $8 for 3 years) and the coverage is great so if you have an accident they've COMPLETELY got your back! This is my first camcorder and I am VERY happy with my purchase. Would definitely buy again! :)
5,I ordered this camera for my granddaughter who is very interested in learning about video recording. I had some reservations because of the low price but I decided it would be a fine entry level purchase. What a wonderful surprise! The camera is more than we expected and exactly what she needed and wanted. Easy to operate fits perfectly in her hands came with extra battery and all she needs to make her videos. She's thrilled and so are we. The playback is excellent and she loved seeing her very first efforts be successful. Very happy with our purchase.
5,I bought this for my 10 year old son for his bday. His thoughts-The setup of the controls is convenient. It’s a good size and fits great in my hand. It works great. It came with the video audio plug nice. It came with batteries and only takes one at a time. It has great film quality.  I think this is a great camera for a starting filmer. I recommend it.
5,I'm so happy that I bought this camera. We hired a professional cameraman to cover an event and the video quality of this is far better. Beyond my expectation in a positive way.  I waited until I actually used the camera before writing a review. I'm impressed.5 stars all the way.
4,Good Great For The Price
5,This would make a great gift idea for a starter video making. Would work for Vlogs or any amateur videography (starter YouTubers unite?!). Has a great case 2 batteries etc. You do need a memory card (SD) to use it but those are fairly cheap as well. The battery life is great and overall its an excellent purchase!It was easy enough for my son to take straight from my hands and use without instruction. Simple and straightforward. I would have loved to get this as a gift when I started doing videos and my son is ultra pleased to take it off of my hands while I'm busy.Honestly you can't beat this price. Great value and product!
5,I bought this camcorder for my husband for our Anniversary and I must say we truly do love it. Picture quality is well worth it. We get to capture precious moments of our love our children family friends & special events with a very clear and vivid eye. I recommend this camcorder to those who love to capture heartfelt moments.
5,I bought this camera because i really like the looks of it but it turned out to be so much more! I bought it mainly for my kids to take videos of themselves because they like to pretend they’re YouTube influencers. I have to say that I’m impressed by the durability of the camera. The picture quality is super decent as well. Overall i love the camera for the price.
4,I like how it’s so small and I can take anywhere
5,I teach college classes on-line and wanted to transmit better images for my students. Therefore my primary purpose in purchasing this camera was to use as a USB web camera. However the image quality is so good that I am using it around the house and yard to record daily activities. The picture quality is outstanding and the features such as the zoom fill light and hot shoe for my microphone are an unexpected plus. A great value at this price point.
5,This camera is very light weight and easy to manage. My wife and I purchased this camera to capture special moments in our child's life. It does the job well. We really like that it comes with two batteries and can take still photos. You can also record while charging. It is super easy to hook to your T.V. and record to an SD card. It is very user friendly and you will not break the bank. Overall we are very happy with this purchase.
5,I love this camcorder! It came completely assembled all you had to do was put the battery and SD card in. It has great picture zoom in quality great. Even my husband was able to function it right away! This will be so great to document life's adventures. It also comes with a black soft case to store it in. 10/10 reccomend.
5,I ordered this camera to document some of my hunts and times with my family.  It has far exceeded my expectations and I only wish I'd purchased it earlier.  I already have priceless videos far exceeding the cost and I look forward to making many more.  Its small size also allows for easy carry under almost any condition which allows for those surprise videos normally only wished for being recorded.
5,Hello! Just wanted to write a quick review for the camcorder. We wanted something to capture moments of our future child and this is the perfect camcorder. I love how small it is so it will not be a problem carrying around. We did a few videos and the quality is great! This is a perfect small camcorder especially for the price that can be used daily to capture those special moments!
5,I purchases 2 of these as gifts for my daughter's xmas presents and they love them They are easy to use and the picture quality is great. It was an awesome value for the price and i get amazing videos of my grandchildren I definitely urge you to purchase one i think this would make a wonderful gift as well
5,This camera came in really quickly which I was happy about since it was a gift for my sister and she LOVED IT. It was so easy to use and get the hang of and is especially great for someone who is interested in starting to play around with cameras. The picture quality is great and it has great image stability which is great for kids! Definitely recommend !!
4,Great little camera for the price but video quality on playback leaves a little to be desired.What do you expect for $50 though?Again great little camera for the price.
5,This is a great camera for the money. Excellent for amateurs. I bought this for my mom and she loves it. I do wish it would accept an sd card larger than 32 gb though. The battery life is great. Long lasting battery and it comes with two batteries. I would absolutely recommend this camera to anyone amateur or not. The zoom feature works great. 16x zoom is great. It takes 24mp still photos which are very high definition. The camera shoots video in 1080p HD. I am very happy with this camera. Buy one now. You will not regret it.
5,I got this camera to livestream events for some of the organizations I help with and it seems to work great! The ability to use this as a live USB camera with a computer makes it incredibly easy to interface with recording software and livestream to Zoom YouTube or any other streaming platform. I can't speak to audio quality as we use another device for sound input but the video aspects of the camera are quite good especially for the price.
4,It’s soo good I’m in love you should get it!!
4,I purchased this product for my 8 year old son.  He loves filming and this is easy to use and great way for him to learn.
5,I got this video camera to capture those little moments.  It was so easy to get the sd card in (purchase separately). The menu and buttons are easy to navigate and switch between video and camera and the pictures are great quality! You do need to hold the camera still to make sure no blurriness but it's a great budget option!
4,It gets the job done but the quality leaves something to be desired not the best picture and the SIM card is a bit difficult to get in and out
1,Oh my...  This is the worst camera I have every seen in my life.  IF I could give picture quality a negative rating I would.  This has nothing to do with shipping or people.....IT is just a very bad product.  I tried to film a youth football game from the stands and the resolution had to be about 100.
5,I bought this camera for the birth of my grandson because my husband  is not very tech savvy and I wanted something quick and easy that he could pull out whenever the phone wouldn't do the job. This camera is very compact and depending in the size of the purse or bag will take up very little room.The controls were very easy to use and short of providing your own SD card this camera is ready to use out of the box.We have used this maybe 3 times since purchase with zero issues and the videos come out crisp and flawless. Great bang for the buck.
2,Video is good quality for price however the sound during playback on the camera is terrible. It’s super low even when i play it back and hold the camera to my ear I can barely hear it. My iPhone’s sound is louder than this camera during video playback.
4,It's amazing great quality and easy to use.
5,This camcorder is really simple and small I use it to make memories with my children and many movies with my kids it's very simple to use and I recommend this camera to those who are looking to start getting comfortable blogging and or making mini scripts. Me and my daughter have so much fun taking turns recording each other I highly recommend this camera very simple very praiseworthy and it's a good start to a good bloggers life.
5,This a great camera for the price! Very happy with my purchase. It has a good zoom and picture quality. I bought a cheap one to use while snowboarding and this is perfect. Lightweight and affordable. I really like that it came with two battery packs too so if I can just slip the next one on super easy if the first battery dies. It's picture quality is grest outside.
5,The camera came in at a decent time from order and is in very good shape. Well packaged and comes with two batteries all ready charged so if you have an sd card on hand you can start filming immediately. The functions are simple enough to learn and there's some handy features such as a built in light and the screen can be turned 360 to view at any recording angle. The video quality is decent and the sound could be a little better but all in all a great starter camera at a decent price. Definitely worth the amount it's for and will continue to be using
5,I was very satisfied with the product especially for the price. The camera quality was much better than any of the more expensive but older cameras I I currently own. Some things I would add if you ever revised the product or the next in line to add the ability to save this settings you change so you don't have to do it every single time and make the zoom a little smoother.
5,I bought this hand held video camera for my daughter to video/take pictures while visiting her great grandparents out of state. She captured a ton of memories that she can cherish for years to come. The video and picture setting on one device is very helpful. So glad I purchased it for her!
4,This camera is fine for a starter but I was expecting a little more bells and whistles after reading all the reviews. Overall I am still am happy with the purchase based on the price and overall quality.
5,I purchased this for my grandson as a Christmas gift - he absolutely loves it!  He kept wanting to make videos but we didn't want to hand over the family video camera so we decided to buy him one of his own - this was the perfect price and size for his use.  He's already been filming in his backyard - the world is now his "studio"  - he is filming everything!  This was a great gift and I know he will get a lot of use from it - I recommend it!
5,This camera is so convenient! I don't always like using my phone to record and this is small enough to carry around. Trying to start a YouTube channel and i already take a lot of space on my phone. Haven't explored all the features yet but 2 batteries is an added bonus so you always have a back up! I have no regrets so far!! Will be vlogging my next trip to get the full effect.
5,We are so excited to take this camcorder on vacation with us this summer. It is easy to use compact and works great. The zoom is amazing and the picture quality is great. We love that it has a video and photo mode. Also black and white sepia and a few other effects. It was the perfect gift for my teenage son.
5,Camera very compact with lots of settings to "tweak" how you take video.  Capable of Full HD HD and VGA quality video with higher quality taking more space to less space as you downgrade picture quality.  Comes with 2 batteries  enable to take video for a good while  charging cables and nice little case to carry and protect camera.Recommend use of tripod when possible  which it is set up to handle.
3,The camera works fine. It's a good little beginner camera. Takes MicroSD cards for easy uploading onto things. Only thing I wasn't happy with was the picture quality. It's pretty fuzzy. At least compared to cameras I've seen. Or even cell phone cameras. Also unless you have hella good lighting in your home this is better as an outside camera. Picture is super dark. Flashlight doesn't help at all. Definitely wouldn't buy again OR recommend to anyone. Having that said my son is 9 and as stated above it's a good started camera for him. Not totally unhappy with the buy.
4,Easy to use can’t complain
5,We got this camcorder for my son who loves to make Youtube videos.  He was previously making it with his ipad or phone.  It was very difficult to load the content into his computer.  It's also not easy for him to film.  He loves his new gadget.  It's small light and durable. Super easy to upload.  He was mostly impressed with the quality.  He can't wait to make lots of videos.Excellent product at a very reasonable price.  We highly recommend it.
4,Zoom button was broken since I got it.The seller later contacted me and explained the difficult situation they are in. I changed my rating to 4-star
5,I bought this camcorder for my Husband's birthday for him to do his videos. I must say that he loves his camera. the built is sleek and easy to hold and carry around. The video quality is pretty decent and he is enjoying video himself and watching himself while he videos.The only problem he has is with the sound its sounds a little distant and low. But overall he loves it. For the price I would recommend this camcorder.
5,Product arrived on time. Camera has a feature that most cameras don't offer. That feature is no auto shutoff. This means that while viewing a movie clip the camera automatically plays the next movie clip. There is no need to hit play on the camera to view the next movie clip. This is a huge bonus besides the clear vibrant picture you get from this camera.
2,Was very disappointed I. This product. I bought due to good reviews and it being labeled as "Amazon's Choice" but when I recieved it and played around with it I realized its not the best quality. They claim it has auto focus but auto focus does not work AT ALL and I'm left with a very blurry image. I searched around the menu for a focus tool but found nothing.  The zoom is terrible it is not a smooth zoom in/out but a very "glitchy" zoom. When holding the zoom button it zooms in by notching forward each second of zoom. Really cant explain it but its not a smooth cohesive zoom in/out. I dont mind the feel of the camera as it feels light weight and kind of cheap plastic. If it did a better job with the actual video picture I'd totally keep it. I find it hard to believe that this product is HD or 1080p and very confused about how it has such good ratings. Super bummed and will be returning. Was hoping to find a half way decent camera for my son without breaking the bank.
5,I was very surprised to the quality of this camcorder.For the pricei thought it maybe not good. Instead I got a great camcorder with  some accessories. Is a nice gift for my son.In factwe need to get the right expectations. This is not a professional camcorder product. This is only a camcorder value for $60.It is nice quality for the price.The pics quality is great in the daytime the pics is colorful and clear.The pakage comes with  a neat little case for camcordera USB cable and video cables the charger of camcorder 2 batteries. The only extra thing that you will need to buy by yourself is sd card.
5,I bought this camcorder for my son for Christmas so we haven't been able to test it out yet. I also need to get an SD card which it does not come with. So far it is in excellent condition. Not too many controls to overwhelm someone. It is very compact perfect for his hands. Next I would like to get a tripod. One thing at a time 😊
1,omg what a piece of garbage this camera is .. first its plastic like a child's toy second I had so many issues trying to load the videos onto my computer and  I have never had any problems with my other cameras  or other devises .. then when I finally get the file loaded you cant here me at all ! at first I thought maybe I was standing too far away like 5 ft but then I tried again with my mouth right next to the mic and you can barely here me speaking with my computer volume all the way up... The video quality is poor and the camera has no sound adjustment on it at all .. DO not waste your time ..I'm sending this back I'm so upset I'm tired of fake reviews too such a scam if anyone says this was a good camera and worth the money its not true !  I doubt this will even make the reviews ..but if it does trust me its garbage I wouldn't even give this to my 7 year old grandson its that bad ..
5,I currently have a Sony Handicam that was around $300.00. My mother really liked it so we decided to buy her this one off of Amazon. Both batteries were fully charged right out of the box. It does take very good videos. The only thing that makes the Sony better is the image is less shaky. You need to have a very steady hand whenever using this camera. I would recommend this camera however. Don't forget an SD card. Have fun filming memories!
5,I think this is a perfect starter camcorder especially for the summer! The instructions make it fairly easy to use and the quality definitely gives me vintage vibes. I am obsessed with the early Y2K era so this the perfect camcorder for me. I just wish it had an input so I could attach an external microphone.
5,For the price you get nothing but every cent plus in this camera.  I've had no issues with its functionality.  The camera is easy to operate and navigate through its menu's.  The different options it gives you make it a very versatile camera for a beginner.  This camera was by far a great investment for my son who is 8 years old wanting to make videos for his YouTube channel!
5,My husband and I wanted to get a camcorder so our daughter's first Christmas could be captured and we're so glad we chose this camera. Not only is it lightweight and easy to use and the picture quality is awesome but it's such a great price for what you get! We can't wait to have all our family memories for our daughter to watch one day. Highly recommended!
5,This camcorder is great for the price. I  originally  bought it for myself but m nieces and nephews soon claimed it.  It was really easy to set up.  I hadn't originally seen that I needed to get my own SD card so make sure you do!  You  basically load up the batteries and it's good to go.  It's lightweight and very portable.  My nieces and nephews can navigate it easily.  Picture quality is solid as is sound!  It's easy to navigate. Buttons are easily labeled and battery comes precharged.  And there’s an extra! Key cables are included. Definitely recommend !
4,This video camera is okay pretty good for the price I guess. However the screen stopped working almost immediately after using. I was able to get a replacement within two days after sending message. I’m very impressed with their customer service. I haven’t had any problems with the new camera.
5,This little camera is great for something to carry around and hold memories on. Not the best for wanting to start youtube or other types of blogs. However I wanted something to carry around this summer to record memories that isn’t on my phone and this camera is it!Keep in mind you get what you pay for.
5,I was looking for a moderately priced quality camcorder which I could use as a webcam and is supported on my MacBook. This little camera is a masterpiece! It had exactly what I wanted and more in terms of video quality support on Mac connectivity etc! The fact that it has all the cables to enable connection to PC and TV was also great! I would definitely recommend this camcorder you will love it!!
5,This is such a great little video camera. The high quality of photos/videos definitely exceeded my expectations! I like that you can spin the viewer around so you can see yourself on camera. It also comes with a convenient traveling case which is a plus. I bought this for my 9 year old and he has been having so much fun with it!
5,This camera is pretty user friendly. The battery was already charged when I opened the package so it was ready to use. SD card not included. I wasn't looking for a camera with too good of a quality because i want to make VHS 90's looking edits. So the recording quality is just fine for that.
1,Everything is bull crap about this phone This Camara is crap please take it off the market asap there is nothing you can do to fix it I sent it back first day I got it. it's more like a $5 gum machine Camara definitely not worth the value 😡😡😡❌❌❌❌🚫🚫🚫
5,I was very impressed when I opened the package and saw the quality of the camera not only how sturdy it is for the price but the quality of the video. It is easy to use and has other settings to that will help you adjust as needed when in different lighting. Overall great purchase and I am happy!
5,Bought this for my son who is 11. Wanted something inexpensive but usable. It's a great little hand held camera for a novice gamer. Comes with a carrying case (but nowhere to store the extra battery). We bought a trippd to go with it works with no issues at all. Great little camera for the price if you're not looking for something overly fancy.
5,I got this little camera for our family road trip this year and it's been great! Nice image and comes with accessories besides memory card but those are considered pretty inexpensive. I even forgot to charge it overnight but it lasted me another whole day on half battery. It's small and compact so it fits well in a purse or backpack and it also has a handy strap that allows the device to be carried with ease.
5,This product is great quality we are going through the process of getting pregnant and this camera is recording every step and I’m talking about IUI I am able to hook the usb cord up to my tv and look at videos I have took great picture and sound also. I recommend this HD camera for anyone trying to capture the most important and precious moments like I am!
5,I purchased this for my 8 year old son. We are very pleased of this Camcorder! I like that it is very user friendly so I just had to show my son how to use it once and he was ready to go. The build quality great. The videos and pictures quality is great during the day with enough sunlight. At night it’s perfect more than I would expect at this price range. The audio quality is good. The best thing is It comes with 2 batteries good carry case etc. Overall I am very happy with the purchase and so is my son.
5,I purchased this camera for home video use because of its reasonable price and good reviews. I am NOT disappointed! It is small and lightweight and the carrying case that it comes with is an added bonus. It came with TWO batteries (awesome)!I haven't been able to determine the true clarity of the images because I have yet to transfer the files to my computer. The zoom is clear but it isn't very smooth.Overall I'm satisfied with this purchase and I'd recommend it to others searching for a simple home camera.
5,Fits perfectly in small hand like mine. Not bulky.
5,So i purchased this camera to start making even more memories with my kids. I love how simple it is to operate! i do wish it had a better grip the strap is very low. I would recomend this to anyone who just wants to create moments for their family and is not looking to spend a lot of money.
5,Arrived quickly. Packaged nicely.  Out tech savy teen will be putting it together when I gift it to her. She will be excited as she has kept our video camera we bought 19 years ago to use. She will be so excited to put this to use & nice little padded storage case & re-chargable battieries.Remember to buy a SD card 32 or higher that is not included.I will update my review as my kiddo gives me her feedback.UPDATE: Daughter to back to college and know one can get it to work with out static.
5,There are two caveats if you keep those in mind this can be a great little camera. 1st you will get a quality HD image only if you have adequate lighting. If your lighting is lacking the image can be a little grainy. Comparable with other cameras in this class. 2nd (and sightly related) the auto-focus does not seem to work as well in low light conditions. Adequate lighting and it is very sharp. However as with most cameras in this class (and even in more expensive ones) the focus is fixed.Keep those two items in mind -- adequate lighting and fixed focus and you'll be happy with this camera for the price.
5,I am impressed with the size and quality of the video camera camcorder. The image quality is great. The device comes with two batteries a carrying case and a video input port cables/power supply. You will need an SD card for it. The HD 1080 quality makes it a great addition in recording/taking amazing pictures.  To charge the batteries they have to be in the camera while you charge. This is a great all around camera at an excellent price point.
5,This camcorder comes with a travel case a second battery and a cable that connects both to USB and RCA so that you can display videos on your computer or TV. I really like that the camcorder comes with these accessories especially the 2nd battery. The battery was a little tricky to insert since it needs to be lined up with the different slits and doesn't just slide in. The manufacture told me this was to make the battery more secure. The camcorder is nice and compact. It functions as expected. It has both a video recording and picture mode.
5,I recently bought the camcorder for my son and it was received in good shape precisely when promised. We went through all of the cameras features and found it really user friendly and easy to use. We also purchased the protection plan which was really affordable. We hope to get years of great use out of this camera
5,I got this camcorder as a Christmas gift for my 11 year old. She has been interested in trying to do blogging videos and pictures. The camcorder has really good picture quality. She is learning how to zoom in and out and this product is just perfect for it. She is also trying claymation to things and the image stabilization is amazing.
4,This camera had worked very well for me so far. I've been using it to document my wife's pregnancy. My only complaint would be the Velcro on the little carrying case seems poorly stitched. So it is coming off on one side. Very easy to use.
5,I got this camera to use for taking fun videos and it’s quality and camera function for the price is amazing. It works so well and is so fun to use. Really happy about this purchase and I recommend everyone to buy one even if it’s just to take videos or pictures for fun!!
5,We got this for our daughter because she is interested in videography. She has used it everyday since and loves all of the features. The zoom is great and she likes that she can flip the camera to selfie with ease. It charges very quickly and the battery lasts a long time.  We couldn't be more pleased with this camera.
5,I wanted to review this great camera because it’s good it works and did a good job for my self tapes jobs. I am in the start of taping myself for advertising and the job required a certain resolution. Its super cheap so I was worried but I can assure you the resolution is good enough and for the price it’s fantastic I would suggest everyone to get this one
5,I bought this for my 10 year old and so far she is very happy with it. The picture quality is excellent. Most importantly it is very easy to use no complicated set up or anything like that. My 10 year old was able to set it up and start using it right away. The zoom is perfect for the pictures and videos she needs.
5,I was surprised how small this camera was.  It comes with two batteries I installed one and it had power put in an SD card and was ready to start recording.  it small enough that I can put it in my pocket when not in use. Haven't used it yet to see the quality of video it takes given the amount of light there is but based on the reviews I would expect great video except in very low light conditions.
5,This camcorder was a birthday great gift for my son!!! He has special needs and his dream is to become a videographer the picture quality and the image stabilizer has excellent quality. I was not sure about this camcorder because of the price and now looking at the quality of the videos I'm thoroughly pleased.  I recommend it as a starter camcorder for youths.
5,My husband I love our camcorder! We bought it to have a more stable place to record and house our videos vs our phone where we'd likely lose them with time. We literally film EVERYTHING and it is so much fun. We hope one day when we have kids get old or just want a good laugh we can go back and watch all of our random videos. We are so happy we chose this camcorder for both cost and basic recording.
5,I bought this camera to film my boys' lacrosse games. Came with the tripod and the card. Unbelievable price for all three. It works great for what I got it for. The two batteries lasted through the entire game. Quality of video is exactly what I needed it for. Great product for the price.
5,This is my honest review ( I also read reviews before purchasing).I purchased this for my 9 year old daughter to carry wherever she goes because this is what she enjoys doing. The camera is lightweight and fits perfectly in her hands. (Our previous camera broke and looking back now it was bulky and heavy.) Audio seems good and she is definitely enjoying that she can also take pictures.  I had a question about setting up the clock and customer service did a fantastic job at replying quickly and with detail directions.
5,This camera is a good deal for the price!  So far have had no problems.  Easy to use and maneuver plug 'n' play with a memory card.  Love that is comes with a second battery!  Did not realize that is would default videos into AVI format but it is easy enough to convert to MP4 for social media and storage space.
5,We purchased this camera to film a promotional video for our school. We didn't think it would be this good for the price. We was able to film our video and use it on our Sunday walks. The kids had no challenges filming for their Youtube channel. I recommend this camera to any videographer youtuber or just someone who wants to film. Light weight and easy to use. This camera is awesome.
4,This is a great product works very good
5,It was a Birthday gift for my son who turned 9 this year. He and his sister who is 6 loves to make video for fun. This camera was perfect for little kids of that age. Its inexpensive perfectly fitting for their hands and picture quality and other features are good for the price.  They loves it over all.
4,Can’t wait to use for summer
5,This was super easy to setup just attaching it by USB to my PC and select the PC cam menu option.  It integrated with Skype and Zoom with no issues  and was easy to choose as a webcam.  I did have to pull the USB a couple times to get windows to initially see it but it has been rock solid since then.  i have been using this for business meetings and the picture is even better than some of my customers cameras.
4,We use this for quick family videos instead of always using our phone. Connects real easy to the tv and computer so we can all enjoy an instant memory. A little dashy occasionally on zooms... but all in all we liked the price and the quality. Not making motion pictures... just recording some family moments to watch later... easy to use and set up.
5,We needed a camcorder to record kid sports and other daily activities since the iphone storage gets clogged way to easily.  This was a good find with a really decent price.  You get two batteries for the camcorder and that's definitely a plus if you're planning on recording long sporting events.  Overall very satisfied.
5,I bought this camera for my 11 year old granddaughter. It's small size and weight is perfect for her.  It's easy to use and takes great pictures.  It's a good start-up camera for amateurs at a good price.  She's having fun with it and being very creative in how she uses it.  I would definitely purchase it again and recommend it to others.
5,This a great small video camera. It’s totally ready to go straight from the box the batteries are even fully charged you just need to add your own SD card. We tried it outside and indoors and it performs really well. It’s very easy to use and the handle makes it easier to get stable one-handed footage than with a cellphone camera. It also works with our tripod and the view screen turns a full 360 so you can record yourself easily. I would definitely recommend this camera just remember that you need a memory card since it doesn’t come with one.
5,I am working in the Marshall Islands and wanted a way to deliver videos of my experience to friends and family but the files were to large to email. I bought this having never used a camcorder before and had never uploaded a video to YouTube.  The user manual was a little difficult to follow so I emailed the seller asking for a pdf and within 30 minutes it was in my inbox. Impressed. This camcorder is easy to operate and the picture quality is outstanding. Most important it has a pause feature that you wont find on cameras costing twice as much.  A great little product for beginners and exceptional customer service.
5,After researching multiple similar products I finally decided on this one and I am NOT disappointed. The picture quality is great. The audio is not professional but still good quality for a product this price. One thing I liked specifically was the batteries last longer than other products. I hope to use this product for family videos for a long time.
5,This camcorder is excellent. I'm not the most tech savvy chic so I needed a camcorder that would be easy for me and my 10yr old son to use and so far we love it. It's so easy to use and it was ready to go right out the box. If you looking for a camcorder that's easy to use with good qualities and easy manageable features this is the right product for you. Start creating and recording memories that'll last a lifetime!
3,Not bad
5,Needs a MicroSD -- but those you can buy anywhere (Walmart etc) Once I got it I used it right away and it's fun! I have a cheap phone so the camera takes way better videos and pictures! I can use this on all my trips and audition clips!It even screws into my light tripods!
5,This was purchased for my daughter who wants to be a movie producer when she grows up. I thought it would be fun to let her make her own home movies and stuff. I honestly am super surprised at how nice this camera is for the price. Zoom works. It’s light and compact for her cause she has small hands. Image quality is nice. Definitely would recommend.
4,No comment
5,This is one of the best tools I have. I use it to video myself playing songs I've written rather than using an audio only device so I can also see the chord progression I use for the melody line. If you dabble with song writing or if you are a professional this is a great way to record. I highly recommend it !!!!
5,This camera is AWESOME!! It literally fits in the palm of my hand with easy push button recording with your thumb. I can easily transport it in the included case it also comes with an extra battery. I am a package car driver fro UPS and never get to see my childrens games. My wife can toss this in her purse and record everything I can connect it to my TV and watch when I get home. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a small compact video czmera
5,We got this camera for our daughter who wants to start VLogging. It has such a great clear image on Pictures. The zoom on this is fantastic! So glad out of all the ones we looked at we chose to buy this one. The price is great for a great quality camcorder. We will definitely tell others to purchase this !!
2,There basically is not sound because u have to strain to hear it even when you yell at the camera. The quality is low quality. My childs kidzoom camera has better quality and sound than this recorder.
5,The camera is working great so far and the video quality is good too. This is a perfect camera for my summer school projects and making presentations. I’m very happy with my camera. It super easy to use and both batteries came charged out of the box.
4,For the price it works nice. Just gotta buy several sd cards for it. It runs out of space quick
5,I bought this cause of my son took my other one  he does video on internet and my wife does makeup on it this little cam does great job smooth running and easy to use and perfect run time  i might get in trouble using it  cause its easy to hide and i can prank my family and film it  very nice for price  buy one now Yall .
5,This camcorder is absolutely amazing for the price.Super compact and lightweight!I got this camcorder for a friend who was going on a trip. They were not really tech savy so didn't want to get them something too expensive that they would break.This camcorder ended up working perfect. The LCD screen can tilt so you can see what you are recording. It also takes still photos. Best part about this one is it comes with an extra battery.Oh ya don't forget it comes with a cool neat CARRYING case!!!!A+++++++ would buy again!
5,I used this camcorder for an anniversary party and I’m going to use it for Christmas videos. I’m very pleased with my purchase and I would definitely buy from this company again. My item came well packaged. I couldn’t believe you get an extra battery which is great. The quality is excellent and the zoom image is very clear. Seller gives satisfying service
5,I wanted just a simple easy to use video camcorder. For the price you can’t really beat this one. I did have to buy a separate SD card but found one here on Amazon for pretty cheap. It comes with 2 batteries a carrying case charger & usb cables. Very pleased with this purchase just starting out taking videos!
5,When this video camera camcorder arrived I was impressed with the size of the device. The device comes with two (2) batteries a carrying case and a video input port cables/power supply. The HD 1080 quality makes it a great addition in recording/taking amazing pictures. Its a great camera/camcorder for those YouTube stars in your family. The sound quality is outstanding and the quality of the picture is fantastic. This camera/camcorder is great for new beginners because its truly user friendly. If your looking for a great video camera for a great price I'm sure your future YouTube star will appreciate it.
4,Works very well is very well made compact size and very good battery life.  Picture quality nearly what I expected but decent enough for quick photo's!  Love case and extra battery.  Compact size fits nicely in my hand.  Overall a great video/picture camera for the price.  I would recommend it!
5,I bought this camcorder for my son to do a filming project for school. He really liked the image quality which is HD 1080 easy to use buttons are clearly labeled. It is surprisingly light weight but study you can get a good grip with one hand and hold it still to capture good picture and image without shaking around better than taking pictures or video using smart phone. It comes with 2 rechargeable batteries and cables. And I like that it has a pouch for easy storage and it can fit in any bag or backpack. I recommend to take this for vacation to capture pictures and videos.
4,Nothing yet requires a reading to register
3,Seems like it would work great for video if someone was recording from a distance but it absolutely will not clear up if you try to bring something close to the camera.I'd say for some this camera might work fine but I will be returning it and getting a better camera.  Just is not good enough for my purposes.
3,OK for th e moneybut  do buy a better one ( usually  more expensive) if posible. Picture is not the best in the dark as in a house setting is worst  too grainy. But for tou pay is fine.
5,Needed to get a video camera for a construction job we have going on to video site activities. I was surprised at how compact the video camera was when I received it. When opening it up I discovered that both batteries were fully charged. While testing it out I learn that it can also take still photos which is a big plus. The side screen lets you preview what you have photo or video files. The price and lightweight of the camera makes it perfect for the cheap price.
5,What surprised me about this Video Camera is how light it its.  Haven't bought one in the last few years and those had some weight to them  this is like holding a feather while shooting.  Also gives very sharpe video's this camera is great for someone starting new and its great for young people to learn on  I bought this for my grandson's birthday as he was making animal video's on his cell phone  you can't go wrong with this purchase.
5,I bought this for my 9 year old daughter as a gift.  I think it will be perfect for her.  I tried it out before wrapping it up and it works as advertised which is amazing considering the price.  Comes with two batteries all you need is a memory card.  Also comes well packaged with a case and charger.
5,I have used this camera-camcorder and have been very impressed with its value. The pictures are very crisp and clean without any distortion in terms of lighting or color. The video contact was equally as good. I am planning on posting videos on my YouTube channel in the future. I also like the fact that it comes with two long lasting batteries. I have a much more expensive video camera that used regular batteries that do not have near the life. I really feel that this is a great value-especially for the price.
5,This is a sweet little camera. I bought it for my 2 young grandsons to use to make " Movies". They love it. It is easy to use and a compact solid well made camera that fits perfectly in the palm of their hands with the adjustable strap. We look forward to watching their production on our smart TV. A great investment towards their growing imaginations
5,This product provides great value for its price. It has a great quality image and very durable. It is easy to use and well programmed. I bought this for my daughter to document her life on video and she loves it. I will recommend this product to anyone who is looking to get one.
5,I really like this Video camera. It honestly works really well and has a fantastic button layout. The camera is easy to use and has many great features. It has a replaceable battery. Which is amazing especially with the fact it comes with two. It comes with all the necessary accessories and cables. The LCD is really handy it works well and its awesome because it can turn around backwards making this great for Vlogging and other recording. I'm very impressed for the quality at this price range. Overall amazing camera!
5,I got this for my daughter who is really into vlogging right now and she absolutely loves it. It’s a great size for a kid and is super easy for her to use. I love that it comes with two rechargeable batteries and video quality is impressive. I think this is a great beginner camcorder and you can’t beat the price!
5,I love this camcorder video. It is very light weight for my daughter's little hands to hold. She told me it really feels comfortable to hold it. I bought it for her YouTube project. It is very clear when she's using it.  It works good! For this price I cannot ask more. It is good enough for me. I don’t want to spend thousands dollars on the famous brands. So far this product is great! I love it. It is under my budget. The price is reasonable!
3,My Grandaughter loved the camera except for the fact that when she played back the video  you could not hear the sound.  It was very low and she could not turn it up.  We had it replaced with a new one but it had the same problem.
5,This camera is amazing! My daughter and I have used it so much already and we've only had it a week!!! It has lots of settings to enhance the picture for whatever setting your in it even has a light on it! I love how you can flip the screen around to see when recording yourself. It comes with a case for it which is handy when you take it places. Overall absolutely love the camera especially for the price! Would recommend to anyone looking for a quality camera at an affordable price.
5,Great product! Worth the purchase my girlfriend loved it. It helps us capture all of our memories we never want to forget!
5,I've had this camera for over a week now and I give it an A!  I took it to the zoo and got great shots of my nephews with the animals.  It's lightweight which is very important.  You don't want to be lugging around anything heavy all day.  The picture quality is terrific.  It comes with two batteries which is very handy. After heaviness and picture quality the only other thing that was important to me is how easy it is to use.  Thankfully even someone like me who isn't tech savvy can understand the directions.  Just a reminder though buy an SD card!
5,Excellent video camera for beginners and experienced users alike. Intuitive features and light weight extra batteries that arrive charged and ready to go as well as all necessary cable for attachment to a computer or TV make this camera video ready with your supplied SD card. For anyone wanting an affordable alternative to a cell phone camera.
5,I was blown away with this package for the price! My purpose was to simply record little bits of our Family vacations Holiday gatherings kids opening up the gifts and a small enough camera that will fit in the backpack on hikes and adventures. Sure you can record video on your smartphone but my older model doesn't offer 1080HD and I like the convenience of an 32GB SD card dedicated to video only. The quality is suprisingly great and everything I wanted for a very small investment. Happy Camper!
2,I bought this for a Christmas present. We were finally able to purchase a SD card. I bought 2 and none of them worked. It’s sad. My daughter was excited about using her camera I tried two different SD cards and they letSaying Error. Please help me !
5,My 10 year old bought this - perfect for him as a beginner camera. Easy for him to use and he enjoys it.
5,I love how it can fit in my purse. I can take it everywhere and it holds a charge for a while. While the camcorder is great I wrote and stated I didn't receive my gift card the seller did not like the fact that I mentioned I did not receive my gift card and wrote me and said I will not receive my gift card until I take it down I said no because I didn't receive it. Very disappointed....
4,I know most of us use our cell phones cameras but we can really tell a much higher quality using this video camera.  We are restoring a boat and we film all of the different stages and helpful hints from others. Very happy with our purchase.
4,It’s pretty cool
5,This video camera was PERFECT for my daughter. She dreams of being a vlogger and this camera does everything she Wants! The extra perk is that it comes with two battery's which makes it easier to make sure that when you are needing to record you can without delay. After she started playing with hers I realized I want me own. Overall it is a great camera!!
5,This camera is great for what we purchased it for my daughter is 7 and loves to make her own videos. It’s a great started camera for her that doesn’t break the bank. The video camera also takes photos both video and photo picture quality is actually really good. The camera it’s self is very light she loves it!
4,only reason I didn't rate a 5 was in the description it should be more clear that you need a sd card for the video camera to work which is not a problem and ordered it but nephew had to wait till he could use it
4,***Update. Received my replacement wirhin a day which was great! Was able to give it to my mom as a bday present. So far so good. My mom is happy using it. Will give it some time to see how happy we are with picture and sound quality. It’s easy to use lightweight looks really nice. Charging port is in kind of in an awkward spot. Love that it comes with 2 batteries.
5,I got this as a gift for my 8 year old and she loved it! It is the perfect size for her hands and easy for her to carry and record. After showing her the basics on how to operate it she can pretty much run it on her own. This product came fast and was a great price!
5,Excellent product. Wife getting ready to give birth so we found it to be necessary to get a good quality video camera to record the experience.
5,I love this camera so much!! I haven't even had it for a week and I already know it was worth purchasing. First off it is one of the cheapest cameras you can find on Amazon that actually works. I love how it can take photos videos and audio recordings. The only complaint I have is that the sound is kind of quiet but it still works well if you speak up. All of it's functions work correctly and it is simple and easy for anyone to quickly learn how to use. I would buy this again in a heartbeat. I love this camera.
5,This camcorder is amazing for the price point. I bought it for my almost 7 year old’s birthday since he seems to really be into taking videos and photos and was ready for an upgrade from the toddler camera he had. The quality of the camcorder itself is excellent and so is the picture quality. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
5,I wanted to purchase a little camera for my kids...they are into the youtubers. I thought it would be fun for the to emulate them and at least get good footage for me and the wife that we can relive in the future. I just decided to pick a random camera and try it this was the first one that popped up...honestly and it's a great little camera. I wish the FPS was a little better for the 1080p but for the kids and what they need to just goof around with it's perfect.
5,This camera exceeded all expectations. I am so glad I took the leap of faith and purchased this for my YouTube channel! I can't wait to take this along on my adventures. This camera is high quality and super durable. The extra battery is a bonus. I would recommend this to anyone looking to start a vlog or just for fun!
1,I dont usually write reviews but i feel like i had to for thisWorst camera i ever bought. For the price you should be getting so much better. The combined camera life of both batteries was 15 MINUTES. And it had issues connecting to 2 diff sd cards so i doubt it was the sd card faultsDo yourself a favor and do not buy this.
4,yeah
5,This was purchased for a 10 year old to do videos. He loves it. Has fun with it. Well worth the price and the features are good. He can zoom in and out and honestly has shot some cool video. Very happy that we got this. I even like using it to video the kids playing outside.
5,I like the size and it is user friendly. Zoom is nice but not extremely clear. It does look a little pixelated.  When not zoomed in the image is clear. The picture quality is also good and best when zoomed all the way out. Overall nice camera and would recommend if you want some nice home videos.
5,For the price the camera is ok. I would not buy it for some professional work but maybe for kids or children to get them introduced to video recording and taking images. Its more like a toy for kids rather than a camera for beginners. I don't think a beginner would also apprecitate the quality of the videos or the actual quality of the product itself. As I said it is ok for kids to get used to photo/videography but not a good option for an adult and that is the reason for rating it 5 stars. It serves the purpose I purchased it for.
5,What I look for in a product is quality and this meet my expectations. The product was brand new i didn't like the fact it didn't come with a memory card but it was still a nice durable product. It took great quality pictures and videos. I was able to use it in my photography class and it helped out a lot.
5,Very impressed with this video camera I purchase this product for YouTube videos and the image and sound is great. The camera it self is very light weight and easy to use made with good quality material. When received it did not have to do much just put the memory card in and the battery very simple. It comes with a lot of things too you get two batteries protector bag for the camera also you get the cable to charge the battery and to connect to your TV or laptop and the instructions manual. Overall very impressed with this camera. Will recommend to buy.
5,At first I had a little problem getting the sd card in the slot but I figured it out . It has great picture quality even after you zoom in . I also bought a tri pod with it and it was very easy to set up . Great product
5,I bought for my 11 year old grandson. He loves this camcorder. He found it very easy to use. He has made his movies and taken photos of the animals around the farm area. He loves this camera. I am glad for it has great quality pictures
5,I bought this as a gift for my husband who is a photograper/videographer so that he can get footage of our new baby in "dad mode" with an actual camcorder. He likes that this camcorder is simple and compact. It definitely gets the job done and had a decent quality while still giving off a slightly retro feel
5,I have been starting my own YouTube channel and haven't had much experience with camcorders but I loved this one! It was easy to use -- power on zoom record etc was self-explanatory. Most of all I LOVE the fact that you can twist around the viewing screen so you can see what you look like while you're recording! (I get self-conscious about making sure I get the right angle of myself!). Very pleased with the product; it delivers what you're paying for.
5,When I ordered this it came with no batteries or cord I reached out and they replaced it immediately and I am so impressed with the quality of this camcorder! I bought this for my 9 year old son to use at Disney and he now wants to use it everywhere we go.
5,I chose this camera due to the price and features
5,I am now using this for iracing and Youtube videos as well as photos of my products for my online stores. It has great photo & video quality. Many features. It also came with 2 batteries. I recorded a video for 2 1/2 hours on battery power only. I love the screen which rotates 270 degrees as well.I recommend this product to everyone. You cant beat the quality & price.
5,The video was clear and the battery was long lasting. It came with a nice case so I can store it on the go. simple to use and not hard on the pockets. Be sure that you only use the correct size memory card  good work =)
5,The camcorder arrived working perfectly with no issues. For the price this camcorder is able to take pictures and videos with ease. I use it to take videos and pictures around the house and they're easily transferrable to my laptop. I look forward to capturing more memories with this camcorder!
5,This compact digital video camcorder delivers great quality for a great price. It’s small so it fits comfortably in your hand.  The video quality sound quality and picture quality is excellent. Easy to use and comes with a little case for it and a spare battery.  All you need is a SD card and you’re ready to go.  It’s great for beginners and for recording family functions for those not wanting to use their phone. You get a nice HD video you can then upload to your computer. I’m very surprised with it and my nephew loves it.
5,This is a great camcorder. I bought it for my 9 year old who wants to make videos. The two of us have been using it all over. She took a video of a bird using the zoom feature and I was impressed with the quality of the video.It is also very easy to use. My daughter has been experimenting with different settings and doing very well.Fun camera.
5,This was a gift for my 7 year old who of course wants to be the next YouTube sensation! I had originally bought a different camcorder which was a total disappointment. This camcorder came with two batteries a case and the cord to hook it up to the tv. An extra battery means non stop recording and fun! I’m so happy we decided to get this one the quality is great and he loves it. Definitely earned all 5 stars!
5,I like that this camera is light weight and fits comfortably in your hand.  The instructions on how to use the camera are easy to understand and the functions while using the camera are easily accessible to the user.  The camera is small enough you can carry it in a jacket pocket.  It is easy to transfer any photos or videos from the sd card .  I have enjoyed using this camera and look forward to enjoying many more hours of filming and photos.
5,My 8 year old daughter loves this camcorder. It is easy to use the picture quality and sound are great. It easily zooms in and out and the image stabilization works nicely. This gift now allows her to make videos which she loves to do. I would recommend this camera. I have one extremely happy future film maker!
3,My daughter opened this on Christmas and we charged both batteries but they only last for about 3 minutes before the camera shuts off. The video image is gone but the audio is muffled. For the price of the camera I would have expected a lot more. Will be returning for something else
5,I ordered this looking for a small and easily packable video camera and this product lived up to my expectations. It comes with two batteries and the case is the perfect size to pack in a bag. Image quality is good and you can hear sound through the camera (though it's not the loudest) and it's louder when you plug it into a computer/TV.
5,We have been very satisfied with this video camera. I bought it for my grandson to use to make YouTube videos. The camera is a good quality camera for the price. We are so happy with it that we have been using it to take videos of our  6 week old grandson as well. I would recommend this product to anyone wanting a good quality camera for a reasonable price.
5,This camcorder was bought as a gift for my 14 year old son. He loves it the picture quality is very good 24 MP it does not come with an SD card but those are very cheap. This camera features a zoom option. The display screen is very nice quality and the camera itself is very light and easily hand held. This comes with a case charger two batteries and an instruction manual. It was shipped with 2 day shipping and arrived on time. We could not be happier with this product
5,This camera was really easy to use especially for a beginner like me. I'm from the age of the huge video cameras with VHS or smaller tapes but videos and images just aren't in my tech skillset. So for me this was perfect because it was so simple to use. The image quality is great and unlike some cameras you can use this one right away without having to read a book or understand a new language. You do need to buy your own SD card to use with it though. (Not complaining just mentioning so other buyers don't forget to grab one.)
5,I am a grandma and got this camcorder to film my grandchildren and just have fun.  The camera is a great value considering the cost and quality.  It was easy to use mostly intuitive. The camera comes full of accessories like the USB cable video cables charger two batteries and a case.  It’s handy lightweight and compact.  It has zooming in and out and wide-angle lens flash and photo modes and an hour and a half continuous filming battery life.  As an amateur this camcorder is perfect for me. I can’t believe the low price for so much recording fun.
5,Never had a video camera before and this is the first one I've gotten. It works awesome! Have used it to record my son and I catching fish to show everyone. Great picture quality.Zoom works great and even has a light and color filter options. Comes with 2 batteries charge cable/tv connection cable and carrying case. It's easy to use and fun to use. Highly recommend this product! Great item at a great price!
4,Camera works perfect.
5,After searching and reading through numerous reviews I bought this video camcorder to record the precious moments of my two little ones. As a first time owner I find it very simple and easy to use. (I've had it for the past six months now) It has all the specs and and features that I need. It's also very light weight and portable to take with you. For the vloggers moms and anyone who is interested in purchasing a video camcorder this is the perfect one! I highly recommend it!
5,I’m shocked. At this price I was looking for something to record my son’s soccer tournament and a little of family during birthday. I was shocked at the features. video pics add light darken light. Wow I thought cheap recorder but it does everything. Even the led screen is great on playback. Much better quality than I thought.Good purchase.
5,This is a must buy item whether for a gift or for personal use. If I have to say one thing bad or rather give a suggestion it would be to mention (stress) the memory card is not included but is needed for the camera to work effectively. Other than that small detail this camera is amazing.
4,It's fantastic all though I received it very late
2,Well it's definitely not as big as I thought it was going to be and the pictures and videos don't seem as clear as I had hoped they would be which is what  I needed it for.I don't know I haven't been able to really use all the features yet it's hard to get around and try to find the feature that I need and the menu the setup or whatever I'm having trouble understanding how to use it. And this is more frustrating trying to rate this product cuz I'm supposed to put in 100 characters blah blah blah blah blah I don't know what........
4,This is a fine first time camera for my 9 1/2 year old grandson. His only complaint was the sound which he thought was too low. But this was an okay 'starter-kit' for making YouTube vids. We are still interfacing with then laptop to see how vids can be utilized. I will try to keep you posted on this.
5,I love the quality of the camera and the fact it is a very compact and light device. The camcorder provides high quality video and pictures with a flip out screen that can twist all the way around for when you want to take a video of yourself.Considering the quality of this product it's listed at a very affordable price and it well worth the cost. In addition to the camcorder we received two battery packs and a sleek case perfect for when we travel. We are going on an international trip in July and are very excited to bring this awesome camcorder!
5,i will say that i have not yet used it for any length of time but have been "testing" and playing around.  i was surprised by the result and it is definitely better than i expected as well as much better than my iPhone (my phone is already a few years old).  the camera weighs close to nothing--super light and very easy to hold.  i recommend this for a fun "new toy"  which is easy to take along wherever you go.  just be sure you buy the card along with it--it's only another $6.
5,This camera is of significantly better quality than the price-point suggests.I needed it to use as a webcam and that works just fine...better than my other webcam apples-to-apples at the same settings.Then I tried it as a video camera and it worked far better than expected. I'm a videographer by profession and I'm saying for the record that for a point-&-shoot pocket camcorder it's pretty great!If you're hesitating don't. Buy one...you'll like it!
3,As I I said in my initial review  .digital zoom feature did  not work ..  jumpy and  functions in  only one directionSo requested a replacement .. one day delivery  .. Just LOVE  Amazon for serviceWe will see if this was a one off problem ...  a ton of mixed reviewsLike the unitI will keep in car glove box  for use as a second recording device. ..  available  ..  all the time .  Great price on Lightning Deal .... A Steal
1,9000 reviews and 4.1 stars?? If you have ever owned an iPhone in the last 15 years the video quality of that will be far superior to this. As far as using this as a camera it's unusable.I won't go into detail other than every bad point brought up in all of these reviews are dead on. And every positive review I just don't understand at all.You will buy this camcorder realize the picture quality is horrendous return it and post a review just like this!!!
5,They have came a long way from the camcorder I bought in the early 80s. This is a Great little camcorder . Everything is at your fingertips. The picture is very good and it mounts up to my 80s tripod with no problem. Building a outside BBQ kitchen and videoing it. You cant lose on this buy.
5,This is a great purchase for me to be able to video my family when they come over and it is worth the money also great product with picture stabilization to make it easier to be able to use it and the zoom is good for the close ups and the video qualityOutstanding product with a price that Amazing have been known for.Thanks HAOHUNT  AND AMAZON
5,I bought this camera due to the high amount of positive reviews. I was not expecting this to be such a little camera. Not that that is a bad thing. The quality is great for the camera. The ease of operating it pretty straight forward. I also like how well it fits in your hand.  I'm very pleased with my purchase.
5,Came in nice packaging with two batteries and an adapter to hook up right to the TV. It is nice and compact so you don’t have to worry about bring a huge bulky camera around. I liked that it also came with a case since there isn’t anything to protect the lens otherwise. Pretty easy to use so it’s great for beginners plus you can’t beat the price. Brings me back to my old home video days.
5,I got this video recorder for my son as a early Christmas present & he absolutely loved it! It’s very self explanatory and kid friendly! He’s 7 years old & works it like a pro. It also comes with a case to put it in very happy about that! Will buy again & very likely to recommend!
5,I used the camcorder for the first time to video my grandson playing tennis in a school match.  It fit my hand easily and I was impressed with the quality of the view screen that swung out from the camcorder body.  It came with two lithium batteries.  Everything was ready to go right from the box.  Playback is easy and the audio sound quality is good.  Connection to the TV proved easy even for a non-tech guy like .  It gives me everything I need at a great price.
5,I bought this camera for my son’s birthday. It is a great quality camera. The picture comes out good has ability to zoom and easy enough to use. The camera is not hard to figure out and my son already enjoys making videos. Also like that you can easily delete videos from camcorder.
5,The camera is amazing. The price was awesome too! The clear picture you get while recording is pristine as well as the pictures you take. The zoom is 10 times better then any other camera I've ever owned before. The best part is the LED light you can use while recording in low light. Definitely one of the best!
5,Ok so I was looking for a camcorder that was a decent price and also had great quality and I found it! My family wanted a camcorder because we're bored a d decided it would be fun to write and make our own little movies! This camcorder is small lightweight and easy to use which is great for when my young ones are operating it!
4,I’ve not used the item much yet but I will during the Winter holidays with an update then.
5,It’s a great camera for the price. That’s all you need to know. It does it’s job of capturing memories and is very easy to handle even for a child. I do recommend purchasing a stand if you decide to do some vlogging. We used this cameraMainly outdoors. Mainly by kids. And mainly for the delight of showing the parents what adventures we had. The image stabilization only does so much. With a kid handling it there’s nothing you can do to fix but it’s what we wanted.
5,My kid wanted to start making youtube videos so I decided to pick up what I thought would be a cheap little camera.  It's actually a very nice camera!  It doesn't feel or look cheap and works great. You can't go wrong for the price!  Shipped on time and in perfect condition.
5,I bought this for my son for Christmas so he can start doing videos for his Youtube channel. We love it!! It's the perfect size it fits in the palm of your hand! Its easy to use and the picture quality is great! He hasn't put the thing down since he opened it! :-)
5,This is the first video recorder I have owned so I am still learning. It is easy to hold and focus and the zoom seems to work well. The instructions are informative even though the font size could be much larger for old eyes. I am very satisfactory so far and hope to improve my skills with the recorder.
5,My daughter loves her new camera she starting a new YouTube channel and she needed a camera to get started and you can go check her out @ Sonaja Brice she also wanted to thank you guys she said it has the best quality HD picture thank you so much I’m buying another one today.
5,I bought this as a father's day present for my husband! It has everything a person needs and wants! It is the perfect price too! I bought this in hopes to use it for our kids special moments such as school plays and Christmas mornings! It will be perfect! It also has a lot of different overlays to use while recording causing really cool effects! What more could you ask for?
5,I wanted a gift for my granddaughter as an end of school year present. Knowing that she aspires to start her own YouTube channel I went looking for an inexpensive video recorder and found this one. Its price was perfect. I wanted to give it a try to see if it was as simple to use as I hoped but I decided not to do that and watch my granddaughter unpack it. My granddaughter had no problem at all. My only wish was that the description stated more clearly that you need an SD card to make it work.
5,Works great and exactly what I expected
5,I love the early 2000s feel of the camera. The quality is especially great for the price and Has a zoom option and multiple color options such a black and white and sepia and it is also abled dim the brightness which really helps when you’re over exposed
5,This camera is lightweight and so cute. I didn't realize it worked as a video camera as well as a regular camera so that's a plus.While I was trying to figure out all it could do I accidentally took pictures of my wall an bed.. I was moving but they came out perfect. 😁😁Great deal and a great price !!!!!
5,Upon unboxing this camera it felt as if it should have been more expensive than it was. I was also happy that it came with two RECHARGEABLE batteries! That's a necessity for me as my old camera took disposable batteries. I'm excited to start vlogging with it and recording memories to last a lifetime. Customer service is also very responsive and easy to reach!
5,This is the perfect modern video camera it reminds me of the old school cameras. I love these so much better than just video taping on your phones because you can get longer videos. It has really good quality and the battery does last a long time! Also the price is great!!
5,I bought this camera for a family trip and I was surprised at how good the quality of the picture and videos are as well as the ease-of-use it is a good build quality and still looks brand new even after 10 days of getting picked up and handled and dropped by kids ect  it’s a very nice camera I would have to say that it is on par if not better than my Sony cyber cam I would recommend this to anybody who’s looking for a good digital camera for shooting video
5,i was looking for a cheap camcorder to record digital videos on the go and be able to give them a nostalgic feel without editing. choosing this camcorder was the perfect decision--it gives me everything i need in terms of color quality zoom capacities stabilization and playback. it's the perfect size to be portable and it's lightweight. super satisfied with my purchase.
5,Such a great camcorder. For the price you can't find a better one. The battery life is awesome and they give you two. Plus it comes with a charger and carrying case. If you need quality video it also gives that. Buy it! Trust me. A+ seller and product.
5,I bought this camera to record videos for a YouTube channel I'm building. This camera is quite easy to use an the video is very clear. One tip I would give is that if you remove the battery for storage (as is recommended in the manual) you will need to check the date and time settings as they will reset.
5,I liked how easy this was to use. I also enjoyed how compact and simple it felt in my hand. It comes with its case and 2 batteries which is nice as well as all the usual cables can corders supply.I think it’s a good camera for everyday videos. The zoom is not smooth. Pretty choppy as it zooms in and out of things but it does zoom in a good distance.I gave it as a gift to my nephews who have been wanting to film some hummingbirds in their yard. I think they will really enjoy it.
5,This video camera is great for beginners it’s self explanatory and easy to use. I use it to record my sons basketball games. The focus is good when I zoom in and out. I only had one problem when my charger it’s. It charging the battery.  Overall I am satisfied with my purchase.
5,I bought this camcorder for my kids to use and record videos with.  The product is sturdy and easy to use.  Comes with batteries already charged so it was ready to go right out of the box which was great since the kids wanted it right away.  For the price point you can't beat this product if you or someone you know wants to a nice camcorder to record videos.
4,This camera has great picture quality and is easy to use and very portable. The sound comes off a little muffled and staticky when viewing on my laptop. I think the use of an external mic would fix that issue. For the price and it’s intended use this camera does just fine.
4,Very decent camera for the price. Will eventually upgrade but it does the trick for now.
5,An absolutely great starter camera for an aspiring blogger or for starting your own YouTube channel which is exactly what I bought this camera for. For the price the excellent picture quality and how easy it is to operate it is absolutely everything I could have hoped for. If you are new to making and editing videos this is a perfect choice for an initial camera setup. Very impressive and wallet-friendly overall.
5,I received my camcorder January 21st 2021 and I absolutely love it. I have recorded lots of memorable videos and taken lots of pictures the quality is great and I highly recommend this for someone who is looking for a nice not to expensive camcorder.
5,We really don’t care about quality. I kinda like the look. It brings back memories. I don’t have much to complain about so far so good.
5,Show about this camera is an awesome little camera for beginning photographers it works well it's football as well all the features are awesome it comes with two batteries which was an added bonus I love that feature about this it comes with all the cords to charge it it does not come with a 32GB SD card to put in there so that you'll have to purchase by yourself but this is a great starter camera great for teenagers or School functions great for anybody who's just starting to get into the photography and videography world
5,This camera is perfect for kids who want to get into film making.  It can definitely be used as a tool for learning all the features that go with video.  This video camera is user friendly easy to handle and easy to understand.  I highly recommend it the best value!
5,Great little camera! I usually use my phone camera for recording and taking pictures but I wanted an option that didn’t use up all my phones battery or storage. This camera works perfectly and has good quality recordings! I really like the zoom quality as well. I’m pretty sure it’s digital zoom so you do get the blockyness that you get when zooming on a smartphone but with this camera you can zoom much further before it gets blocky. Battery life is solid as well. Solid pickup that I’d definitely recommend to a friend!
1,This camera is not good at all. Wish I would not of got it. Have used it one time and the sound on it was very poor. Can not put mic on it to improve that. So it is just a paper weight to me now. Still in the box it came it. Wish I could send it back. DO not buy this camera.
5,I got this device for my 8 yrs old daughter who dreams of being a youtube star.  It works well so far.It does not give good picture in low light but that is to be expected. I will need to look into getting a tripod to stabilize the picture.So far my daughter enjoys taking random videos and viewing them on the tv. The second battery comes in handy for continued use.Definitely a good starter camcorder for my little girl.
4,This product is user friendly and good quality.
5,I am a teacher mentor.  I purchased this camcorder to record the teachers' annual observations. I've never used a camcorder before.  It is simple to use.  I didn't want to $pend a ton of $. It's VERY rea$onably priced. The video and audio quality were beyond my expectations. I'm glad I purchased the suggested tripod. Holding the camera during a 30-60 minute observation would be a challenge. I would have liked to share a video but I have to protect the identity of the students in the classes.
5,This a great camera and will be perfect for why we bought it. Using it for filming our sons 🥍  games to build his highlight reel. The size is perfect and easy to use. The zooming is perfect and still has perfect picture quality. Thanks and keep up the great work.
5,It's easy to change from video mode to picture mode.  The picture and video quality is outstanding.  The size of the camera fits my hand well.  The camera turns on with ease.  I like everything about the camera and would highly recommend it.
5,This camcorder is so cute and tiny and so worth the price!! I took it on a trip and it took the cutest vintage looking videos. For the price the quality is surprisingly good and the design is also very sleek and easy to hold!
5,I got this camera as a gift and mostly wanted it because I wanted a camera that I can film videos and take pictures with that was separate from my phone. It does exactly what I wanted it to do plus more with its zooming features different effects etc. I had so much fun using and playing around with this phone. Yes this is not the most high-tech camera but if all you want is to film simple videos/ pictures this is perfect.
5,We bought this as a Christmas present for our 8yr old so they could began making memories and having them line we did as kids.  This was her first camera and already she is loving it it’s easy to use and for an 8yr old to use with easy access to battery and memory card.  This is definitely worth the price and easily the best starter camera I have seen for many years.  Dont hesitate to buy for any use.
5,I bought this for my son for his 8th birthday. Of course he was ecstatic because he wants to be a youtuber like every other child his age. This is the perfect camera for someone his age. I know nothing about video cameras but I do know we haven’t had any problems with this since we purchased back in April. I see the other reviews talk about it’s not a good buy but I guess they were expecting something more for $60. This is a good little video camera and works fine for the price.
5,I love this camcorder so much! It is very high quality with great features. I can't wait to take it out in the spring and take photos and videos of nature with it. I've enjoyed taking videos of my mom with it already. I give my highest recommendation for this camcorder.
5,Easy to use price is great for the quality
5,This is an amazing camcorder. I was really surprised with how good the quality is. I was kind of skeptical at first but as soon as I got it I went out to test. All I can say is wow! For less than $70 I will guarantee you will never see any of this quality for the cheaper price.
5,The picture quality on this camcorder is excellent. You cannot find a better camcorder out there for the money. I bought it for my teenage daughter and she loves it. It also comes with a little camera bag and an extra battery pack. My teenager takes his camera everywhere and does high-quality video shoots
5,We were needing a camera and the price was right on this one. It's very easy to use and the picture quality is what I expected. I did some test clips both indoors and outdoors and the outdoor videos looked best though it also did well inside while using some photography lights. The more lighting you have the better your video quality will be.
5,This camcorder is a good product at this price point. It is easy to use and very compact. It comes with two batteries which is a nice touch. An SD card is not included so one needs to be purchased. I am very pleased with this. It works as expected and as advertised. I really like how compact it is. It fits into my camera bag easily.
4,Good Product good for a kids camera which is who it was for.  Does not zoom and microphone could be better but still excellent for this price range
5,I bought this camera for my son's video production class. I didn't want to spend too much money but I also wanted a decent camera for him. This camera is perfect for what I wanted. Came with 2 fully charged batteries a camera case and the plugs that it needs. It is light weight and very easy to use. It zooms in and out real good. Takes nice pictures and great video. You get an awesome camera at a great price.
5,Great product quality of video and picture is excellent very easy to use will not be disappointed can't be beat for the price wish I found it sooner and you receive two batteries need I say more 🌝. Yes is so light weight and even has light zoom feature just awesome 😎
5,This a great little camcorder to start recording your home videos. My kids kept asking me to borrow my iPhone to record home videos to start a YouTube channel. Instead I bought them a camcorder to kickstart their YouTube empire. The picture quality is not as great as the latest smartphone or other high end video recorders but for the price it’s an outstanding purchase. Couldn’t be happier.
5,I was surprised by the quality of this camera. Given its small price I was expecting a poor quality product. Instead I got a pretty decent  camera. Image quality is great.  Easy to use and extremely convenient size. I recommend this camera for anyone traveling light.  Great purchaseextremely satisfied.  Great quality.
5,This is a great camera for it’s price. I bought it to use for beginner youtube videos/streaming and I think it’s going to work great as a starter camera. Very easy to use and comes with simple instructions! Again for what you pay the picture quality isn’t bad at all.
5,Product was more than expected for the price.  He wanted to  Record our son's soccer game and it works perfectly. I would recommend getting this for any experience you may want to get on video. It just takes a quick memory card and you are set.
5,Works with no problems.  Zoom was sufficient for young pre teens. Easy to use. Good image stabilization and good picture quality
5,Easy to use if you read the manual carefully. The image is superb  if you set it to automatic white balance. Very sleek design and very light weight  perfect for vlogging. Packaging was very neat and concise and was delivered fast. Love it. Only you may need extra lighting if you are recording in the bedroom.
5,I didn’t know what to think when I purchased this camera at such a good price but I’m so pleased I did it has brought so many good memories in such a short time owning it the ease of use and battery life is good too.
5,I bought this camera for my 15-year old who has found her heart in capturing photos of all forms of nature.  She was overjoyed.  The camera does not come with an SD card so make sure you buy one for it  but luckily we had one from another camera so she could use it her first day.  The picture quality is good and the options are good for a first time camera.  Very happy with my purchase.
5,When I ordered this video camera it wasn't Amazon's Choice but has since become Amazon's Choice.  And I can see why.  It is my choice too and it was the best one.  The quality is the best you'll find for the price.  It even comes with two batteries and a case.  Also the included instruction manual is easy to follow.  I haven't used all of the camera's features yet but the ones that I have used work perfectly.  I also like the one year warranty from a company that stands behind it's products.
2,I purchased this as a 2020 xmas gift for my mother in law. She loved it…however she brought it to me a couple months after xmas and explained it has just frozen and stopped working. Unfortunately I was outside of the return window:( so I just purchased a 2nd one ONLY bc it is on flash sale for like $54.00 and I guess I will be forced to throw the other one in the trash so frustrating. Hopefully this second purchase doesn’t prove the be as big of a waste as the first.
5,My son loves to take pics and videos but I didn’t want him to play with a smartphone because he gets tempted to do something else like play games on the phone. To limit this issue I wanted to get this camcorder for his birthday. He loved it! Although the quality if the pics and videos are not as good as my iPhone it’s good for his use. Plus he doesn’t really care about it. Considering the price difference of like 1k it is understandable =]
5,I ordered a lot of camera from Amazon and this is the best one it has ever thing you can think of and more I just love it
5,I bought the for my special needs son for Christmas. It is simple enough that he can use it. He enjoys taping and rewatching things we do though out the day. It is a great value. Came with two batteries already charged. Loved that there were some instructions on the seller post that helped me get it set up for him. For some reason it would not let me click five stars for picture quality. Picture quality it just fine!
5,This camcorder was bought for my daughter who is interested in making movies as  Christmas gift. The package arrived on time and the package contained all the items listed. The camcorder works well zoom is on point and having two batteries is going to work out perfectly fine. Great buy!!! ✌
5,This was a gift for my wife's birthday and she absolutely loved it! It is very basic and easy to use. It is also easy to upload videos to your computer. I do recommend this to anyone needing an inexpensive video camera that takes quality videos. One thing I will say is that when you replay a video on the camera screen the sound isn't very good but once you upload  it to your computer the sound quality is very good.
5,My favorite part about the camera is how lightweight and compact is. It also comes with a carrying case which is helpful when trying to prevent damage when transporting the camera. I bought this video for my son and I first YouTube channel. The functions are easy to figure out but if you are unable to the users manual is also broken down very easily for you to navigate.
5,Great camera for the price! I purchased as our family is about to become larger and I wanted to be able to capture moments with our new little one.  I think this will definitely do the trick. I also love that we can take photos with it as well.  Sellers service was also fantastic. Quick and responsive to questions.  Thank you!!
5,I bought these cameras for my ex husband and I so we can record the lives of our kids over the years and it has been great for what we need it for! Picture is clear easy to use and I have no complaints so far! We’ve had them for a month!
5,My husband and I bought this camcorder as a gift for my mother-in-law for Christmas. She loves it! The picture quality is amazing and so easy to transfer videos to your computer! The perfect gift that’s great quality for the price! You can’t beat it.
1,I purchased four of these cameras for our office. All four proved to be defective. They would record sessions in 15 minute increments (which was fine) however when trying to playback a 15 minute video it ALWAYS stopped between 6 and 7 minutes. I tried all 4 cameras I used different SD cards of different sizes I used different playback devices. Same problem every time. Very frustrating. Also the cameras seem to pick up a humming sound no matter where we position the camera. We do not have this problem with any of our other cameras. Very disappointed.
5,I had a flipvid previously but it disappeared. I don't mind that because the video camera i replaced it with makes it easier to make the short videos I create for my business. The camera is pretty much self explanatory. I figured out just about everything without reading the manual. Now I have great picture quality and a better zoom. Absolutely worth every penny they charge.
5,This is for my teenage son and I’m really happy and  impressed with the size of this camera.  It also comes  with two batteries video input port cables/power supply and a carrying case. The HD it has 1080 quality which is great! It’s a perfect camera/camcorder for any IG or youbtuber starting out. The  sound quality is really superior  and the quality of the picture is awesome! It’s super  user friendly. If your looking for a great video camera for a great price this is it!
5,I was looking for a nice camera to record some home videos of the family. Nothing fancy and this camera is perfect for that. Good quality and light weight.
5,I was pleasantly surprised by the portability of this camcorder - extremely lightweight & compact fits easily in my bag & even my husband's pocket. Downloads easily to PC & we found free software online to edit the video clips. It is so use-friendly that my husband fell in love with it & he is using it to video his own golf shots so he can review them for training purposes. Would be a great training tool for taking videos for baseball tennis & other sports too!
5,I got this for my daughter who is very into tiktok and YouTube and she absolutely loves it! It has amazing quality when you zoom in it still looks good instead of blurring out and it also takes great pictures as well! My daughter is definitely SO SATISFIED with hers! Thank you!
5,This camera is super easy to use! I'm impressed at the quality of this camera. Besides the zoom quality it does its job smoothly. As camcorders tend to be expensive nowadays this is a great camera to save your coins and gain decent videography skills!!
5,I like the Size it is only a beginner camera. The button on top is too loose you have to be very careful with it.I was going to use this camera for video of my massage business but i need something with sharper pictures.This video camera will go to my grand daughter.Also it comes with a case.
2,I have to say that I’m really disappointed with this product. It Has such good reviews I was so excited for it. But upon opening it I found that the physical product quality was very poor. The plastic is really cheap and not all of the buttons work because of it. The zoom control wasn’t working so I checked the manual just to make sure I was using it correctly. The manual doesn’t tell you how to use it but says that the 16x zoom that’s so heavily advertised is only for the playback feature. I was pissed but tried it on playback anyway. It doesn’t work at all though. I tried recording with the camera light lit and there’s zero difference from when it’s not lit. The photo video and audio quality are all very poor. I’m only giving it 2 stars because it technically works (mostly anyway).
5,Super cute lightweight easy to use compact video camera. Great picture quality. I like that the screen rotates around so you can see an image of yourself while you are shooting. Love the acessories I like how it comes with two batteries a backup included and a carrying case  and tv input cord. Super easy to use great for beginners. Great value!
5,I like this little camera. It literally fits in the palm of my hand. I am not very tech savvy and this camera is easy for me to use. I just received it so not a lot of experience but the few recordings I have made came out well and were easy to download. Also it cam with a case with belt strap 2 charged batteries charger and multi purpose cable. Looking forward to use it more.
3,I would only recommend this to do short little videos. I bought it for the sole purpose of recording my son's Christmas I had the battery fully charged set it up and when u went to watch the video IT RECORDED IN 13 MIN INTERVALS!!!!!!!
5,I purchased this for my nephew to use to make YouTube videos. He absolutely loves it so I absolutely love it. I can not think of a better company to order from and i will absolutely be back because my nephew needs accessories now.ThanksKevin Day
5,I bought this as a gift for my mom - I did a test run before giving it to her and it’s awesome! I love how easy it is to use the awesome clear picture and how comfortable it is handling/holding it!! I will be purchasing again for a Christmas gift for my nephew!
5,Very nice camera! I purchased for my 13 year old son because he enjoys making movies and wanted him to have Some thing nice and also so he didn’t need to use his phone any more. It’s the perfect hand held size and easy to set up and use. Would definitely recommend!
5,This camcorder is a great purchase. The quality of the picture is outstanding very much crystal clear! The product also came with a light weight storage case which was a bonus for me! I enjoy the chrome finish on the lens gives it a nice finish aesthetically.
5,Got this camera for my son to use for his YouTube channel so he’d stop using my phone and storage. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and features! The extra battery has been a lifesaver. Very user friendly lightweight and very compact. Highly recommended for vloggers as well as any other purpose!!
2,Very difficult to use the video feature. I still don’t know how to pause video. Also I had to record an event that was over 4 hours long and the video would not record continuously. It kept cutting off and restarting after 10-15 minutes of recording. So my event is now recorded in separate 10-15 minutes segments of over 4 hours of recording. Very annoying inconvenient and so frustrating!
5,A nice little camcorder for the money. Nice picture decent quality considering it's only 16 FPS and the image stabilization works very well.Comes with 2 batteries HDMI cable and little traveling pouch.Have to buy your own SD card but Amazon has a 32G for like $8 so it's a win win.
5,Bought this video camera to do mixed reality VR videos and am very happy with it. It's small enough not to take up a lot of space and powerful enough to do the job well. Love the zoom feature that's as easy as pushing a button. We'll be using for more than VR recording as it is a great size to pop in a pocket and carry it on hikes and camping trips.
1,I bought this video camera based off of someone else recording something and posting it on Amazon I read the reviews and decided to purchase but upon receiving this camera I see it is nothing like what I’ve read nor seen online first of all when you start to record the color of the picture goes from black-and-white to colored it keeps changing and then it sucks that the area where you would be able to have someone be heard is easily muffled by where your hand is holding the camera so you can not hear a thingI even moved my hand and the volume was still very low that I couldn’t even hear anything from the camera I think if they updated it as far as putting more areas where sound can be heard easily as well as tuning the quality of the picture then this camera has potential but till then it’s a no for me
3,While the camcorder is satisfactory in terms of videos and pictures there are a few unsatisfactory aspects.  For one the owner's manual is incomplete.  I am still trying to figure out how to adjust the volume and to recharge the batteries.  Plus there is no name or contact information given with the product for the manufacturer.
5,As soon as I opened the box I knew it was going to be a good quality camera. It comes with its own case two batteries a manual a charger and a cable to connect to a TV if you want to watch your videos/photos on a bigger screen. I would definitely recommend this camera! 5 stars!
5,I am using this for my students to record the video for their projects and they work great and my students are really happy with it.  Very easy to use small and lightweight.  It creates a better image stabilization in comparison to using mobile phones to take videos.  The bonus is also the two batteries where we can swap and use the other one without long interruption.  Highly recommended for starters especially young adults.The seller ships very fast and is friendly in communication.  I am very happy with this purchase.
5,Bought this for a trip and it was defective  would read the video card and the zoom button would not work.  Now with that said. They replaced it and got it to me before my trip.  It worked with no issues and has been working since and actually produces a nice quality.  Even with the first one not working (things happen) they made it right on time and surpassed expectations.  So I give 5 stars all around.
5,This product says so little for the actual price! I’ve been playing with my camera for the last three days and it’s been meeting  all of my expectations. I love the fact that it’s lightweight great HD quality and so easy to use! I highly recommend this camera for people who are just starting out with videography as well as taking photos.
4,This is a pretty reasonable camera for the price.  Not a lot of bells and whistles bu I'd have killed for this camera 20 years ago.  My son uses it for recording youtube videos and so far so good.  Beats his old tablet's camera.
4,Needs remote
4,Sorry I cannot respond re the features since it was a gift for my son for Christmas.  ll I know is it was returned because he was not pleased with the picture quality.
5,My family and I absolutely love this camera!!! I love to go hiking and video my experiences and have a camera that is very light weight is a must it feels as if you are not carrying anything and is small and compact to even store in my bottle holder. I would highly recommend this product!!
5,I got this for my mother. She loves it! She's been making videos since she got it.  It's easy for her to work lightweight and easy to change settings. The quality is fine for her needs given the price point. She just wanted to record quality time and moments with friends. She didn't want anything too "fancy"
5,I got this camera for a school project and i was surprised that the camera quality was very good. It is very easy to use and really light to hold. Overall it is a very good product for the price you pay.
5,Video camera was lightweight and easy to use (I used it to vlog a family vacation.)
5,Got camera few days ago charged it up and went out to test it.Simple to use takes good pictures video is actually really good for a off brand camcorder.The 2 batteries hold a good charge and power the camera for a descent amount of time.I would recommend this for a good quality for the price
5,Great little camera for the price! Got this as a gift for the family and it seems to be working and doing what it should. I was surprised by how small it was they seem to make them smaller but with the same quality.
5,picture quality is great for the price. pleased so far.
5,This product is nice it’s just the sd card was a bit difficult to figure out such as to put in inside the camera . Even though it was the right sd card  it was still hard.
5,I was looking for an easy to use camera that’s lightweight as well. I came across this one on amazon and bought it because it was in my budget. I had to buy a 32 GB SD card for $7 along with the camera because it’s not included. I’ve used it a few times so far- the picture and sound quality surpassed my expectations. I’m not using this camera for any professional purposes but I’ll be lending it to my niece for her YouTube channel. Hopefully she likes it as much as I do!
5,The camcorder was delivered quickly and in perfect condition. The setup instructions are easy to follow and complete. The video/ sound quality coupled with the resolution options are great! The camcorder is lightweight compact the screen is large relative to the size of the camcorder. The buttons and controls are all clearly marked so even a novice can understand their functions. This is a lot of camera for the price.
5,This was the perfect starter camcorder! I wanted something to take on vacation to capture special moments with my two boys and I. I am loving it so far and is super easy to use. I am very satisfied with this purchase and is def a bargain for the price.
4,La cámara está bonita muy practica y fácil de cargar. Pero lo que no me gusto es que no es compatible con MacBook Air y tampoco tiene para poner micrófono externo.
5,My wife and I recently had our first child and we ordered this camera in hopes to capture our little boy growing up. So far we are very impressed. The video camera takes great quality videos and definitely deserves 5 stars. We can’t wait to capture memories of our son for years to come.
5,This camera is the perfect size to fit in your hand. Light weight and easy to use. Perfect for live web cams home use vacations and more. The zoom is good for a small camera but your not going to see anything too far away. It is perfect for the home videos we make. It will get lots of use in my house.
5,This camera is the perfect size for travel. I bought it to use on my upcoming vacation and then on out. Easy to use and it came with its own case and instructions. I’ve been wanted to capture life’s moments like my dad did when I was growing up  and this will be perfect for it. It’s nice to have those memories years down the road to look back on. It would be nice if a SD card came with it but all in all great camcorder.
5,This camera is very impressive when considering aspects like price performance and available features.  It was shipped promptly and arrived in perfect condition.  The batteries were even charged!!  During my testing everything worked perfectly.  Camera controls and functions are easily laid out and accessible.  I was taking my first video within 5 minutes of opening the packaging.  Couldn't be happier with this purchase.  Should I need another I'll be back here getting this one.
4,Worked for a looong time but eventually it stopped turning on and the busy light was illuminated. I'm still happy with the duration of service considering how inexpensive the unit was.
5,I have a newborn and I wanted to get a camcorder to really capture all of the moments. I’m tired of seeing everybody on their iPhones and I really wanted it to be like the 90’s/early 2000’s so this camcorder is very fitting. I can’t believe the price because the quality is phenomenal. Definitely one of the best purchases I’ve made on amazon!
1,I bought this camera for my daughter. She is young so I didn’t want to buy a very expensive camera but I don’t consider $65 cheap either.  I hoped to get a middle of the road camera and unfortunately I got one that doesn’t work. The zoom was broken on the firs camera I bought for her so I exchanged it for a new one. When I received the new one the zoom didn’t work on this camera either. Although I was frustrated I decided to keep the camera. My daughter has only had the chance to use it twice since we got the replacement and now we can’t get the camera to record. I am extremely disappointed with this purchase. My return window has closed so my daughter is stuck with a video camera that she has only been able to use a handful of times since Christmas. I wish I would have went with my gut and returned this camera when I had a chance instead of exchanging it for another camera that works worse than the first.
3,Honestly over time they have cheapened this product. It’s very light and I’m scared I may drop it and if I do it definitely won’t survive the drop.
5,Bought this for my graduating senior to take on his trip. I liked the price since I didn't want him to lose something more expensive. It worked great for him. He was able to film all that he wanted so he can relive those memories whenever he'd like! Which is frequent not what everything is still basically shut down. Thanks!
5,Got it for my husband to video sons games so they can review afterwards. They hook it up to the computer screen and works great. Pretty simple unit and great for someone that doesn't want something ultra professional/expensive.Very small compared to what they used to be. Makes it easy to grab and go.
2,I read through most of the reviews and felt this would be a great camera for a new youtube channel I'm creating called "Cool Military History". Unfortunately even running at HD the video quality wasn't great and the audio both on video recording and audio only recording came out really with a ton of static. I couldn't barely hear my own voice over the amount of static it was producing. I thought perhaps it was just the camera so hooked it up to the computer. While my voice was louder the static didn't dissipate.No matter how close I brought it or how far I placed the camera it didn't resolve any of the problems. I took a few pics on it and all I can say is that my Nexus 5 does a lot better with video and photography than it does. So while most people may like it I just didn't think it was good enough for what I needed.
5,Awesome camcorder and at a great price. Its handheld so it doesn't get in the way and you can use the hand holding it to operate it. Easy. It has a sleek modern design and looks great. Comes with 2 rechargeable batteries so you have plenty of time to capture your ideal footage. Picture is 1080p and beautiful.  Great purchase
5,I received the camera exactly as described by seller. Product was packaged well and arrived quickly. It is the perfect size for me . I needed a camera to travel with. I also use this camera as a web cam for online classes that I teach. I am very happy with it's quality and versatility. Looking forward to all the projects I plan to use this for.
5,Great value for the price. Arrived quickly. Easy to function.You get what you pay for here. Lots of functions but the video quality isn't great.Also i'm assuming most of the 5 star reviews came from people like me who received an email from the company saying if you gave them 5 stars they would refund your money or give you another camera free which I did and they did.So like I said... great value for the PRICE...
3,My nephew is 7 and wants to learn how to shoot videos he absolutely loves him new camera.Update he opened it and it didn’t come with batteries or a charger I can’t figure out how to contact the company
5,Got this video camera yesterday and I am so excited to use it! It is so simple to use and fits perfectly in your hand and has great image stabilization. It came with a cute case and can easily fit in my backpack so I won’t miss precious moments of my kids!
5,This was much better than I was expecting it to be for so little honestly. Its easy to set up and understand so its very beginner friendly its stable sound quality and video quality is great and then once you add a tripod its like having a indie movie studio. Would definitely reccomend. However do be careful with some pieces as it is a bit fragile.
3,Camera arrived and my daughters and I immediately put the battery in to test it out.....and glitch! It would not record at all and if I used the zoom button the screen started jumping and would not stop unless I took the battery out. I was hopeful this camera would work ok because of the many 5 star verified purchase reviews. Sadly this was not the case so back to Amazon it goes...I am updating my review to 3 start just based on the customer service.  The company has contacted me multiple times to make things right.
5,Absolutely love this. My 12 year old wanted this to document family trips. It’s clear and the zoom is great. You can even flip the screen outward to show another person. Easy to install memory card. Nice size. Very lightweight.
5,With the right equipment along with this camera it was really wonderful to use for overhead artwork videos! The only downside I had at first was the white balance and lighting but I solved that with a small light (right behind the camera) facing down onto the paper.
1,Don’t waste your time with these kind product after u purchase nobody will be responsible for it this junk I would love to return them but there is no one will respond to u
5,My daughter and I bought this camcorder to start up our very first YouTube cooking channel at first I was a bit skeptical about it because of the price but let me just say that the quality of the camera is GREAT for its price  ! I am very happy with my purchase :)
5,This product was just the right size.  I Puchased it for my grandson.  He was so excited to have his own camcorder.  Great quality. I will purchase another one for my granddaughter when she is older.. He runs track and she does gymnastics.  Great for training
5,Nice camera! I’m using it to record seeing my fiancé for the first time in over a year! I’m confident this will capture a beautiful moment beautifully!! I’m also traveling with my 4 month old daughter so the compact size is perfect!
5,I bought a camera cheaper and it didn't work as a matter of fact two cheap cameras.  I didn't want to spend a lot of money but many of the cameras came in at a much higher price.  For the money you get the features and quality of cameras costing a lot more money.  We like the fact that it comes with two batteries.  We were pleased so we bought on for our friend Amy.
5,For the price I was hoping for a camcorder that would provide a HD video with adequate sound quality and that is just what I got. It is exactly what I expected at this price point and I am very happy with my purchase. I have videoed a few events now including one of my daughters soccer game and I have to say that I was impressed with the tracking of quick moving subjects. If you’re looking for a buget friendly camcorder that will get the job done this is the one for you!
5,I wasn't expecting too much when I ordered this camcorder initially. However I can now say that it has definitely exceeded my expectations in both video-quality and user-friendliness. Right out of the package I was able to insert a precharged battery and try out my new product. I can definitely recommend this camcorder for anyone with a budget or even those without because who doesn't like saving money right? This is a pretty good quality camcorder for an even better price.
5,This is an excellent camcorder. An amazing little camera. The video quality is amazing and size of the screen is perfect for a new vlogger. You'll be amazed at what it can do. A great little camera and well worth the money. It records reasonably sharp image and resolution is good. The battery life seem to be good I charge the battery up when I first got the camcorder and have used it a good bit
5,I bought this for my daughter who will be doing hair Tutorials on YouTube along with the suggested tripod we love the size of this and it’s light weight!! Easy to bring anywhere good quality imaging and the volume on this is better than the cannon camera/ cam Corder I previously bought which by the way cost more. I recommend this cam Corder and will give a updated review with videos and pictures as she makes them.
5,This digital camera is really great! The camera is easy to operate and handle. It fits nicely in my hand and the strap helps me greatly since I have issues with using my hands. I can't wait to get my tripod to see how that works but this is a really great digital camera to start off with when new to video
5,I brought this camera about two weeks back and I love the product – it’s real handy and shoots videos effortlessly. The Camcorder comes with two sets of lithium batteries so one can be charged while the other is being used. The video display is clear and the controls pretty intuitive. The zoom is much more powerful than a cell camera. It’s a great value camera to have and capture memories. I would recommend it to anyone.
5,I bought this camera as a gift for my little cousin that's into vlogging and all that good stuff and to my surprise this camera actually isn't bad for the price I paid for it during Prime Day. Battery life is pretty solid. Picture and video quality was pretty good such a compact camera which is a plus in itself. For anyone that's interested in vlogging or in need of starter camera so to speak or maybe even as a gift I would have this on my list of recommendations.
5,I bought this as a birthday gift for my daughter. She loves it she is looking forward to taking videos of our 5 month old and 3 month old Rottweiler puppies to put online. Easy to use a must get if you are looking for an affordable video camera.
4,Even though I had camcorder didn’t work . The customer service was really wonderful. May be I can give a another try with the company in future on camcorder
2,Volume recorded was dismal. Apparently the device has no microphone. It recorded sound but at a low volume.Could not connect to a SmartTV.User Manual was confusing and not written in an orderly manner.
5,My boys are really enjoying this camera! They love making their own shows and taking pictures with it. It’s the perfect size and the battery lasts a long time. The picture quality is surprisingly good and so is the audio! I love that they’re able to explore their creativity and the price is great for the quality you get. Highly recommend!
4,Video quality on our camcorder is very fuzzy but decent starter product for the value.Surprisingly the vendor reach out to me offering a full refund due to my displeasure. I did not accept  as I have already gifted the camcorder but felt their outstanding customer service should be mentioned.
1,Received two batteries both Will not hold a charge no more than 5min. Item appears to work but could not get the batteries to last 5min
5,I was sceptical about the quality for the price but I am surprised by how good this thing works. The image is true HD and it's easy to use. I have issues with hand dexterity and strength but this camera is still easy to use. It's very ergonomically designed.
5,If I'm being honest I did not like the sound quality I dont know if it was a defect but when I play videos on the camcorder after I record them the sound was so muffled and sounded alien-like to where you could barely understand the person. Sometimes how phones sound when they've gotten wet.Other than that I did like the quality of recording. Picture quality could be better.
5,Bought this for a vacation so that my kids can use it at will without worrying about an expensive camcorder being lost or damaged. Tested it at home and the it works great for video however you’d  get better pictures with your smart phone. Simple functions and no bells or whistles but if your goal is to record video at this low price it does that just fine. Comes with a case and two batteries (and charging cable). For the money it’s a good buy for what you get.
5,Bought this as a gift for my grandson to take with him hunting this fall. He loves how light it is to carry and easy to use. Hasn’t had an opportunity to use it in the field yet but in practice runs he says the image was very good for the size and the price.
3,The directions for a novice are vague at best. Big learning curve and I still can't bring close shots into focus. I wish I had paid more and purchased from a mortar and brick store.
5,So after you format the SD card (key user part) this is an amazing little camera. The zoom is nice and smooth picture is clear and the camera is extremely light (one handed). Extra bonus to this is you can flip it out of video mode and take still shots if you want.  The image stabilizer does take a little time to get used to but for what is on the small med-priced handheld is pretty amazing! For day trips and cruise this is THE perfect handheld portable camcorder.
5,I was impressed with the device. The HD 1080 quality is great for recording/taking pictures. The sound quality is great and the quality of the picture is clear. This camera/camcorder is perfect for beginners because its easy to use. Im impressed with the quality of the camera which came for a great priceRead less
5,The video camcorder arrived earlier than I expected. Camera works fine. It will be perfect for small projects I intend to create for You Tube and Facebook. Could use it for making movies but would need editing software to make the picture sharper. nonetheless the camera serves its purpose.
5,I got this as a gift for a child who. It is definitely not a toy but is priced cheaper than a lot of toys that he wouldn't enjoy as much. For the price it's difficult to imagine one can find a better camcorder with as many features in a similar price range. With all of the accessories and the presentation of the packaging I feel like this is a good value especially as a gift. Additionally the seller has been responsive and helpful. I would buy it again.
5,Here's what I enjoy about this camera:1- It's lightweight2- It's easy to use3- It's portable and has good picture quality4- Selfie mode is great tooWhat I don't like is:1- The battery can last a bit longer. However you do get an extra one2- It doesn't come with a memory stick. Not a sticking point but worth mentioning.Overall this is a great addition for the new youtuber or someone who likes making videos outside of their phone.
3,This is a great little camera. But the problem is the minimal battery life. Yes it comes with two batteries and more are available. But there is no way to use an AC adapter.The camera shut off twice today in the middle of shooting some YouTube videos because it ran out of power. It was very frustrating.My suggestion buy a camera that can take an AC adapter.Other than that it's great.
4,For the price a pretty decent camera. Did not have a battery charger and had to order one.
1,This item was a waste and i have already requested a refund. Lets start with the camera itself suppose to be a video blogging camera and how i dont know there is an audio feedback the whole time with poor audio to begin with i bought this with hopes the zoom would work for videoing my tarantulas but nope dont bother even getting within 15 inches of the screen because the image will be less then 240p also this records in lower quality then my droid cellphone that is over 5 years old. the first few seconds of some not all the videos are corrupted with a rainbow of colors and blocks that can only be descried as a lego pattern. all that i was still going to use it to atleast video the over all shots while using my go pro to do the heavy lifting but the way this formats the video onto the SD card (which i bought the recommend class 10 card) it cant be used with HD movie maker pro because the way the file is save it has to be converted resulting in the entire footage looking like the lego blocks. it is 100% useless to me in any way shape or use. i wasnt expecting the deal of the year with this but i was atleast hoping to get something that would work.
5,I have an older model of this camcorder and was very happy with its features. Yet because I needed a new camcorder I purchase this one a t a Great Price. I am excited about using the new version and will probably by other products from this company as they have been very helpful and they are great to do business with. Thanks Again Yours truly Happy Customer
5,I like the size and overall quality of the camera takes wonderful pictures and videos.I dislike the fact i can't zoom and focus objects at the same time and the volume is so low when recording i don't know where the volume is to turn it up to its highest volume other than that it's a 50/50proave con camera for me.
5,It is a very good product for the money you pay! I recommend it it’s worth the money! I bought it as a gift for my daughters so for what they need it’s perfect!
5,We are super happy with this Camcorder we bought it for our daughter she loves it and the quality is great the product came with two batteries and the cords necessary this camcorder was purchased to replace one that was previously broken it wasn’t the same camcorder I was very disappointed with the first Camcorder we purchased from a different seller and returned it and super happy with this purchase. Highly recommend them
5,I bought this as a birthday gift for my 12 year old daughter. She loved it I loved it. I was amazed by the picture quality and stabilization. Zooms in perfectly which makes it even more fun. Easy to operate. We are so pleased. Will definitely recommend to others.
4,excellent video picture despite not being able to use over a 32 gb card.
5,Bought this for my 8 yr old grandson for a Christmas present. The functions on it are user friendly and he was able to start video taping shortly after opening it. Two months later and he's really enjoying video taping jump stunts outside etc.
4,Excellent camcorder for the price. My only complaint is the lack of memory on the devise. You can’t even take a pic without putting in your own USB drive (not included). Besides that it’s wonderful.
5,This camera is great for my videos that I can upload on youtube. Very easy to import them on my computer as well. The picture quality on the camera is different from what is seen on big screens so no worries.
4,Got this camcorder for my 12 yr old son for his first time electronics to start off with. He loves it and works pretty good. Its every light weight and does the job.
5,Great little camera for the price! My daughter uses it for streaming and it keeps the connection. Is a great video quality with easy to use settings. Has a little bit of loss of saturation in low light but she loves the camera! Great customer service too!
4,I purchased this camera on Prime Day for $38.00 It does not utilize the flash and I cannot figure out how to do it manually. I purchased this to film videos for YouTube but now it just sits in its old box.
5,I wanted something to record memories other than my cell phone. This is perfect to throw in the bag and quickly grab it. I’m the handle is nice as you don’t need to worry about dropping it. Great product at a great price!!! 5stars!
5,I bought the camcorder for my kids to record videos with. It's great quality and at the price is a steal! It's very portable and my kids have no problems handling it. It comes with 2 batteries a charger and a carry case. Overall it's a great purchase for any vlogger or just for anyone who's interested in recording memories.
5,Great item and exactly what I expected. I absolutely love that is small and not bulky and fits perfectly in my hand it also comes with 2 batteries for extended use.. I definitely recommend this camcorder to anyone interested in vlogging or even great for kids as a starter
4,We bought this to capture moments of our baby growing up. We thought it didn't work at first when using with an older SD card. Put a new SD card in it and it works like a charm. Great for simple home videos.
5,I bought this as a gift for my daughter she's 8 and loves to steal my phone to make videos. It's very light and compact so it fits her hands well. It comes with 2 batteries but on a single charge battery life is excellent. For the price the picture quality is great. Overall this camera is much better than I expected it to be considering how much it costs I plan on buying a second one.
5,Great easy-to-use Camcorder!  I love that it came with two batteries—I came charge one while using the other and each lasts quite a long time.  The viewfinder is versatile and large.  It allowed me to either point the camera back at myself or away of someone else. My walking around with it the image stabilization minimized and attenuated jitter significantly.  It takes up 32 GB SD card (not included) which allows for long uninterrupted shots which can quickly be transferred to your computer.
5,I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this little guy. Sharp vids and clear pictures. Simple and pretty straight forward to set up and use. Out of the box the battery's took a quick charge and I took it for a "test drive".  Good video rendering and color capture. Other reviews complained of missing instructions cords and batterys but all of that was included. Excellent simple to use starter camera. I have a few but this is becoming a favorite.
5,I bought this camera for my daughter for Christmas. She is in love with it. It easy enough for a 10 year to use and navigate. It does not come with a memory card but I cant complain since the price is good. It has a spot for a tripod and comes with a case. The 2 batteries are nice as well and hold a good charge. As for as durability time will tell.
5,I am really impressed by this camera.  I got it for my kids to make videos so they can watch it on their laptops.  It is very easy to use and gives great quality videos. I was very impressed and purchased another one. Great seller.
5,I bought this for my granddaughter’s 10th birthday. She absolutely loves it. She feels like a real professional videographer.  It’s easy to use. I like the fact that it comes with two batteries. She’s making a mini movie with her sister and friends.
5,Great camera ! I purchased this product a week ago and have been using everyday ! Sending videos to my family and friends across the country . The picture quality is great and using it isa breeze  great picture stability and the audio is great too !

4,I like it its not complicated to use. And it conected to my tv quick sobi say it was worth the money.
3,The camera was nice but very easily broken😔 I used it for a couple months and the screen went out. I’m not sure  how because I did not drop it
5,It is good Picture quality
5,We bought this as a Christmas present for my daughter who wants to be an actress! It is the perfect size for her and the buttons seem like they will be simple enough for her to use on her own. I feel like this is camcorder was a good price for its functionality. It’s compact enough that she can bring it everywhere with her. And I love that it came with two batteries!
5,We bought this for our kids and they love it! It's easy for them to operate and appears to be fairly durable for my boys. They have commented that the playback audio isn't great  probably not the best mic on it maybe?
3,Users' manual is grammatically challenged; sentence structure poor and basically very difficult to follow.  I'm learning how to use the camera by trial and error...many errors before being able to do the things required such as reviewing/replaying videos.  And I'm still unsure how to format an SD card....as well as how to perform other functions.
5,I love this cam corder! I just got it and it is so easy to use. It comes with two batteries a charger and a case to put the cam corder in to keep it safe. Highly suggest! Love this.

I would suggest anyone experiencing a problem please contact this seller their customer service is awesome!!
5,I wasn't sure what I would be getting seeing that this camcorder was such a steal but I'm glad I took a shot. I am so glad that I did. The quality zoom and stability is more than I bargained for. I recommend this to anyone starting a YouTube channel. Bang for your buck and easy to use
5,Not only is the product fantastic but also the seller. I received this on time if not early and they were very kind and greatful for me purchasing their product. I will deal with this seller in the future and recommend others to do so as well.
5,This camera has good viewing quality it is good for quick post around town.
5,The camcorder was a gift for my granddaughter's 8th birthday.  She loves it says its easy for her to use and shoot video's.  It came with 2 botteries and a case. I would reccomend this product to my friends.
5,I thought it would come with a memory card and I had to call amazon for them to tell me that it did not. I also thought the resolution was not very clear
5,I love how light weight and small it is! The instructions are easy to navigate through and I can't wait to create memories with my friends and family this summer!! this is definitely one of my favorite purchases!!
5,Overall this product is great. For the price that I have bought it for it’s good. I love how I am able to zoom in/out and that it comes with two batteries. I am also able to buy and use the memory card that i prefer.
5,I bought this camera for my sons graduation  I played with it and I liked it was small and easy to work . I still have to record the actual graduation and upload to computer to see how good it is but so far everything else is amazing. Came in super fast compared to the wait times amazing has been having
5,I gave this camera to my niece for her 11th birthday and she loves it. It's perfect for beginners and kids. She plays soccer and has already recorded a game watched it . Very satisfied as of now with the product but I also purchased insurance as backup protection.
5,This camcorder has a very nice look to it. It is small enough to fit in a purse for traveling! I love it. It is great for the price and perfect for what we wanted it for. Fast shipping! I can wait to go back and watch all the videos of our children growing up. This is a definite must buy!
4,Pretty good little camera does what I need it too. Picture looks great! Only minor complaint is the location of some of the buttons and the sad card is a bit tough to get out unless u got small hands
5,Good HD picture quality and nice zoom. For this value it's really great product and definitely recommend it.Just need to buy a memory card and It it will comes with full of accessories: USB cable video cables charger 2 batteries and neat little case.
5,Ordered this camcorder so my son could start recording videos for YouTube. We are both so happy with the quality of this product. The image quality is fantastic the sound when added to the computer is clear and crisp. The customer service is top notch as well responding quickly to email correspondence. 5 stars are well deserved.
5,This product is a gift for my daughter's birthday. The shipping was fast everything was in the package. She has been asking for a camera and I feel like this is perfect for her. I gave it a test run to see if it works. Everything works perfectly. I am satisfied!
5,loved this product easy to work with. the zoom goes is further than you would expect and the picture quality is exactly what i was searching for. overall if you are a beginner looking for a simple good quality recorder this is perfect for you.
5,This is a great camcorder for beginners like me. It is small hence easy to carry and takes good quality videos and pictures. I needed some thing less expensive for a marriage function. I didn't want to spend  a lot of money as I am not an expert with cameras or cam corders and I am happy to say that this device was good enough for that. I am satisfied with the product but would have been even sweeter had they included one SD card. But no complaints.
5,I like the simplicity of this camera. It has great camera quality and has a great zoom feature. the only thing is the closer you zoom the less quality you have. i would recommend this camera due to its inexpensive cost.
5,I got this camera a couple days ago and I am very excited to use it. I’ve used it at home to practice and I love the video and sound quality. I wanted to make my own documentaries however I am not a professional which is why this camera is great for beginners! It’s great quality and reasonably priced. I can’t wait to take it to Europe with me!
5,Such a great gift to anyone even for yourself. I bought it for my 6yr old daughter and she loves it. Very easy to use and the camera looks so clear. She's a happy camper.
5,I love the sleek black look of the camera. I was pleasantly surprised to see multiple filters. The only thing I had to buy separately was the sd card but besides that they provide you with everything you need.
5,For what you pay this camera is great. I would buy another one in a heartbeat. this is easy to use functional and so affordable. I got it for my kiddos to record their skits and it's perfect. batteries last a while. transferring data a snap too. this was the best lightning deal I've gotten so far.
5,I was surprised by the quality of this camera. I bought this to record my grandkids. Given its small price I was expecting a poor quality product. Instead I got a pretty decent and fun camera with a lot of accessories.
5,I wasn’t sure if this would live up to the hype but I must say passed with flying colors! The price is mind blowing low for such a great product! Easy to setup and the functionality and quality are amazing! Definitely recommend this for any age!
5,This camcorder is a perfect starter camcorder.It’s got great quality great functions easily understandable & comes with the necessary accessories.If you’re wanting something to start off with I highly recommend. Great for both pictures & videos.Also the support email given is very quick to respond & understand any possible issues.Great investment overall.Great service.
5,The first thing I noticed was how easy this was to operate. The quality of the videos are wonderful. Perfect for someone starting out! It charges quickly and I love that it comes with two batteries. That really comes in handy on a day where you plan to film a lot. The videos are clear and the sound quality is superb! I also found it very comfortable to hold. This is definitely worth the price and I see it lasting quite a long time.
5,This is a great little camera for the price. It comes with a case and an extra battery which is excellent! It has decent sound quality and picture and zooms well. I definitely recommend this camera for anyone who is in need of an affordable camcorder. One note: I dropped it from my height 5ft 7in and partially broke the zoom function. So try not to be clumsy like I am.
5,I honestly just wanted a low budget camcorder that does most of what an expensive camcorder does and this one does it indeed. Not a name brand but works as one though. Records in 1080p and has a good zoom and easy to operate
3,My 9 year old granddaughter loves it. I bought it so she could make videos like she watches on her tablet. I watch a video with her tonight and the sound quality is awful. The picture is fine and I also bought the tripod for it. I wish the sound was better and the zoom does not work at all.
5,This camera was a pretty good item for the amount of money you pay.  Used it on vacation and it worked just fine.  Lightweight and easy to figure out.
4,Buen producto llego antes de la fecha previstafácil de usar me encanto.
5,The quality of this camera is clear and crisp. Great for beginners. I am starting a YouTube Channel so this is a good first camera for me. I love the sleek look and feel of the camera. The sound is great! Perfect for on the go & every day vlogging! Very good price as well.
5,Really happy with this little camera. The zoom works well and is easy to use with the button right where your fingers fall on the body of the camera  The screen is small but bright enough to see in daylight. The menu is easy to navigate.  So long as you have a good light source this camera is going to surprise you.
3,It's not an expensive camera. It would be great for just grab-and-go type filming as something quick to pick up to film an important moment. It really lacks in sound quality the internal speaker sounds like it's busted or something. It records audio ok as long as you're not close to the camera which kind of defeats the purpose. It's also very poor in low light conditions always shoot during the day.
5,As a former US Army Journalist I’ve captured breath-taking visuals on top-of-the-line videocamera equipment. While this product may not rival those expensive and bulky top-end videocameras this compact camera packs a surprising punch. Aside from lower costs and slim frame; this is a must have for budding videographers delivering sharp video and images in high-definition. The in-camera white balance adjustments are perhaps one of the most unique things about this camera. Also doesn’t hurt that it comes with a carrying case and spare battery!
1,Every time you power on it wants to reformat the sd card.  PC does not recognize it as a media drive can't see what you have recorded or taken pictures of.  Complete POS
5,I enjoy the camera for it's picture quality and size. All jokes aside for the the great price money was well spent for the value it really is. There is a stable image in regular settings. When using the zoom i was able to see images better such as license plates.
5,The camera was a present for my daughter she just loved it. It was very easy to use with everything that is needed in a camera like this one. Good quality accessories where the right ones and batteries work perfect.
5,This camera is great especially for recording fun memories with family and friends . You can record all of your memories over the summer and put it all together to look at over the years .
5,This camcorder was better than I expected.  It is very light weight and can fit inside my purse with no problem. This is great for me because I stay on the go. The quality is awesome.  Videos and Pictures come out very clear. My Son made a home video and he loved it so much he asked for his own camcorder.
5,We ordered this camera to videotape our son's football games. The camera works great in standard filming mode but loses some clarity when zoomed in to the max.  As long as we don't zoom it works as needed.  Also make sure you don't attempt to put an SD card over 32GB in it or it will not work.  We're satisfied with the product for the price.
5,When this showed up I was pleasantly surprised. I was looking for something to use to capture memories of my infant son. The size is perfect and I love that it comes with a carrying case. Along with the case two batteries are included which is necessary when your like me and have a habit of not remembering to charge something until the battery fails. I was skeptical of the quality due to the price point but again was very happy with it.
5,I'm so excited to start my YouTube. Soon as I got it I started playing around with it. Very simple instructions on how it works which I love. I don't know much about cameras but if I must be honest I wish the playback screen was a bit bigger. Other than that it's perfect. Perfect hand held size camera for beginners.
1,WHEN I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IT WAS DEFECTIVE THE LED VIDEO SCREEN WAS TOTALLY BLACK IT DID NOT FUNCTION. THE PROBLEM IS IT WAS A GIFT AT CHRISTMAS BUT I WAS UNABLE TO UNBOX THE PRODUCT TILL 4/29/22. I NO WAY TO LATE BUT NEVER THE LESS.... DEFECTIVE AMAZON NO HELP I MESSAGED THE SELLER  IF I RECEIVE A POSITIVE RESPONSE ILL DELETE THIS REVIEW AND REPLACE IT WITH A  POSITIVE ONE WITH 10 TO 15 DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS OTHERWISE YEAH ITS GARBAGE
5,Bought this camera for our son for his birthday. He loves it! Super easy to use and he picked it up right away. Just a quick tip don’t forget to pick up a memory card (can use up to a 32gb) as it doesn’t have internal memory. But other than that it was well worth the value!
5,I purchased this little video camera for my kids as a Christmas gift. They have had some much fun playing with it today! Instant home videos to last a lifetime!! This is definitely a beginners video camera. Perfect for my 9 year old to work.
5,This camera was a Christmas gift for my ten year old grandson. It is exactly what he wanted and needed to take great videos through Christmas.The first time he used it he took enough film to fill up the disc!  He loves it.
5,I got this product to start making home videos with my family we started recording as soon as we received it and our kids were so excited to see themselves on tv. Very impressed with how well it records and the quality of the video definitely a great buy!
5,We wanted a camcorder that we could use as well as our children.  And this product is just that.  We also purchased a tripod so our boys set the camera up and record themselves playing sports. Then we can easily plug into the tv or computer and watch it all back.
5,Great overall little video camera!  I purchased mainly to video my son's flag football games and it hasn't disappointed.  The camera is small enough to fit in your pocket and feels solid.  The two batteries are also helpful to have.  I was able to mount this on a smaller tripod to help with stabilization but the auto stabilization works well when I held it in my hand.  Happy with my purchase.
5,This video camcorder takes videos and photos with the HD quality and stability of an expensive recorder. I read the instructions and started using the camcorder. This is small enough to in the pocket or glove compartment of your vehicle. This is a great video recorder for everyday use.
5,Compact and Cute. The picture quality is great. I love the zoom feature. Excited about capturing moments that have been missed/replaced with selfies. Love that it can take pics in addition to make videos. I'm loving this video recorder/camera.
5,I was iffy at first but my daughter is in film and needed a camcorder for class. To my surprise it is a great little camera for the price. The sound was nice and loud. The zoom worked great and stayed clear .. I'd definitely recommend !
5,This product was amazing. Its super compact and comes with case and charging attachments. The hd quality is great and it zooms in and out with ease. I would recommend this product for all ages and use.
5,So easy to use
5,I have been using this camcorder for a few months now and am very pleased with the quality and ease of use. It is lightweight and well-constructed. I think that at this price point this is a very good value and overall good camera. I would recommend it to a friend.  I would buy from HaoHunt again as they are a reputable seller.
5,Great quality camera for how cheap it is! Was definitely surprised. I got one to start taking videos for the summer and to just have fun with it. Can’t wait to use it.
1,Hardly return anything or write reviews but this was a waste of time. Does not read the sd cards no matter how many times you format it. And it will keep asking you to format it. I wish I could say it was a toy. It’s not even that.
5,Absolutely Love the camera. Budget friendly easy to operate and carry. Perfect gift for any upcoming YouTube Star this is the perfect camera cause it’s affordable and offers great quality. Easily connect to computer to transfer data zoom feature easy to use and very effective. I will be buying another for my nephew
5,Video quality and audio is very good.It has a learning curve to use menu; but once you figure out the menu and mode buttons it becomes.easier
4,I bought this for my 12yro grandson and he loves it. For the price the quality is great.
5,Bought this camera for our granddaughters for their birthday because they love to sing and dance and make movies. The camera is light weight and really user friendly. The girls learned how to use it immediately. They had so much fun video recording their Birthday party too! Great Quality. Easy to use! Very satisfied with the seller.
5,We purchased this for our 8 year old for starting her own vlogging channel. It is extremely user friendly and does a pretty good job at stabilizing the picture shoots. Highly recommended for all user types looking for an affordable but effective tool for vlogging.
5,Bought for my 8 year old son. He loves it and it was cheap enough not to worry if he breaks it. But it has held up for 2 months so far without breaking. Which tells me it’s pretty sturdy.
3,Great
5,Great camera for the price. It's small and lightweight. Battery doesn't last long enough but it comes with 2 so it hadn't been an issue. We use it to film our sons football games so we bought a bigger memory card. Easy to transfer from card to computer for editing.
5,I love this camera! Small easier to use and great for the price! Got a bundle to include the memory card and tripod which is super helpful to video the kids at sports. Super easier to load onto my computer. Wish it took a larger memory card but overall love this!
5,The camera quality is very good and the zoom works well. It’s very easy to use so kids could use it as well. We’re getting it as a Christmas gift for one of the grandkids this way we can capture all the memories as a family
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This is a great camera and camcorder combo! Awesome for bloggers and vloggers! Easy to use and holds a lengthy charge! With this price point I wasn’t expecting this level of quality. If you’re thinking of purchasing think no more! You will not regret it!!! I definitely need to purchase a new one for my pranking stunts on the family for sure lol
5,Got this product for my wife for Christmas. We wanted to go back to a traditional cam because it is fun. It zooms it is light and at the same time sturdy built it comes with 2 batteries and the clarity is great! We tested it in light and dark areas and it works in both! We are def happy with the product especially for such a great price!
3,The microphone picks up so much clicking and crackling that is not in the room and there is no jack to attach an external microphone. Also there are issues with audio/video sync framerates. I wish I had experimented with this sooner because I missed the return window and now I am stuck with it.
5,Product was exactly what I was expecting. Perfect size and weighs barely anything.
5,This camera is definitely worth a buy! I bought it so that I have a camera with me that isn’t my phone whenever I am either out with my friends family or boyfriend!!!
5,This is a great video camera to buy for the price! I've been looking for a video camera for my trips and adventures. I am definitely an amateur recorder but this gets the job done. Quality is great to share memories with friends and family. Easy to use too. Highly recommend!
1,With all the great reviews I was expecting much better. I bought this mainly to use for family events so I don't have to take up space on my phone. I don't know if I have a defective one. But the sound is extremely static and choppy. I don't know if that is just normal and how it's supposed to be but it is not something I can stand. It barely picks up talking at all. Even after downloading the video and watching it on my computer I could barely hear any sound and it was just static when I talked. The zoom does not work at all either which leaves me to believe this is a broken camcorder. The video itself looks like camera quality from the 90's. Although it gave the video a nostalgic feel it was certainly not what I expect HD to be.I'll be requesting a return for sure. In my opinion this is a waste of money. I am really sad and disappointed. Pretty much the only pro is that it's easy to navigate and learn how to use. It was easy to hook up to the computer and it was small and lightweight. I liked that it came with a backup battery and that it was a charged battery when received.
5,I bought this as a gift for my husband who will be a first timer with any digital equipment use. I already tested it out and I am very pleased with this product and cannot wait for him to get to start using it.
5,Got this as a last minute Christmas wish for our 6 y/o son.  He was so excited to get a video camera to make you tube videos so it was worth every single penny seeing his excitement!  It’s simple and enough for him to use and he has a blast making and watching his videos!  Also great customer service on this product
5,I gave it a 5 star for now. I haven't been able to use it till i get the cd card. I read nothing but good things about this video recorder. I hope it's as easy to operate as everyone says.  I do totally love the size. Fits great in my hands.
5,I just started doing podcasts and wanted a nice but easy to use camcorder. The camcorder came with 2 batteries which was awesome and fits nicely in my hand or tripod. It is also very easy to use with lots of functions. Picture quality is good as well. Overall I am very impressed.
5,This camera permanently found a spot in my day bag. It's small so it's easy to pack up to record or take pictures of a family vacation or just to take around with you for day-to-day picture perfect moments. I love the slick feel of the camera and how high quality the pictures and video are! The camera is very easy to use and has a simple manual if you have any questions! My pictures dont do it justice!
5,One of the simplest to use video cameras I've ever had.  It does everything you need a video camera to do and has full HD and an extra battery.  Easy to use easy to store.  Great beginner's or casual user's camera and a great gift.
5,I bought this camcorder for my husband and he is in love I mean he wants to record everything the picture quality is excellent and the battery life is also FYI you will also need to get a memory card to begin using it but other than that it's perfect and I was able to put a smile on my husband's face which is always a plus.
5,The camera is perfect for taking quick videos and pictures.  The image is very stable it fits in a small purse and the extra batteries make it simple to go for long periods.
5,Honestly it’s is literally perfect for what I bought it for. I seen a few reviews before I purchased mine that had me a little unsure. I’m so glad I went ahead and I bought it. Picture quality is good and there are plenty of different settings to adjust the quality if need be. Definitely worth every dollar!!
5,This camera is exactly what I needed and for it's price tag I was pleasantly surprised! It has nice video quality in bright areas and it is very easy to use.The only downside I would say is the audio quality but that could just be the camera that I got. So if you're looking for a cheap and decent camera to buy this is your go-to!
5,I just started to use it i can not comment on durability but I can say that it is easy to use.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I got the camera in question for my 6 year old. I wanted something on the cheaper end for him to mess around with instead of our cell phones camera. He love it he films legos the dog himself us while we are sleeping ha ha. Do not buy this camera thinking it will compete with your 400-1200 dollar phone it is a 64 dollar camera.
4,Camera is great! Takes great photos and videos! The company's customer service is even better! Had a slight issue but within a day of reporting the problem I received instruction on how to resolve it. Absolutely would recommend.
5,I find this product portable and really great for the price. This is a must-have for anyone looking into creating their own videos. The battery life is great. You do not need to be a professional photographer to understand how to use the product. Great product
5,You know this is very low budget camera but for people to love recording on family trips like my father in-law is a very special gift for him this is a no brainer configuration and also pretty good looking camera with 2 batteries and case
5,I am very satisfied with my purchase! This camera was very affordable and good quality.  Did not disappoint. We will use this to record our family gatherings for many years to come! Highly recommend easy to use came with two batteries also.
5,This was purchased for my kids for Christmas they wanted to have videos instead of always using their cell phones to take videos.  They were so thrilled with the purchase and use it all the time!
5,Amazing camera for the price.Does not work easily with MACos.As long as you have a windows based computer you are good to go out of the box.I must also add that the customer support team is amazing and offers top notch service you will not be disappointed. You just have to make your purchase to see what I mean.
5,I was really surprised. This camcorder is nice for a a amateur unit. Stabilization is great low light video isn't bad either. Takes nice photos and is easy to upload to a computer. All the buttons are with In reach. The two batteries are a nice feature. This does come with a case. I reviewed this for the company and I've talked to the representative from this company. They are very nice and care about their products and are open to feedback.
5,I’m so happy with this purchase! Great quality for the price i’m so excited to use this to start recording my behind the scenes for photoshoots & vlogging! Quality is great & i honestly couldn’t be happier!!
5,This project came faster than expected! The customer service is excellent and I love the camera! It’s so cute and easy to use! I love the noise it makes when you turn it on/off! It’s portable and comes with its own case and 2 batteries! I love this product and can’t wait to use it!
5,This camcorder is so user friendly! I am not a technical person but getting high quality videos to use on social media was so easy!I bought one for a family member and he loved it so much I bought one for myself.
5,So far the camera has met my expectations and the only problem I have had is figuring out how to pause when video filming. Customer support has been very good the two times I have called them. The only complaint that I have is the hand strap is not big enough for a man's hand. to fit in and be able to operated the camera.
5,I bought this camera for my niece and nephews because it was too much of a good deal to pass up. After looking at it and playing around with it I was surprised! Good quality for a low price! The quality is okay the design is nice and sleek. I very much would recommend this.

5,It's is an amazing starting video camera I do recommend it
5,My 6yr old son has been asking for a video camera to make YouTube videos. I always record on my phone. It's too much with my phone memory. We researched this camera and it was amazing. He could work it himself and enjoyed using it. The only thing I would change is a light. But overall this is a Great Product.PayPal  info: Reymo77@gmail.com
5,What I like about about this product is how well it works on Linux operating systems.  Right out of the box I did not have to configure anything.  The price is also a plus you do not spend a huge amount of money to get an excellent product...definitely more bang for your buck!
5,I love the size of this camera.  It is so lightweight and fits in my hand nicely.  Pretty simple to use.The camera comes with a case as well as 2 batteries which is awesome.The quality and sound seems great.  You can't go wrong with the price and quality.

5,I brought this camera last min to record my labor n delivery. And I thought the picture quality was going to suck because of the price. But its an AWESOME camera. That as a lot of features and comes with slot of accessories. Takes great images and videos. Very compact.
4,the only thing missing is a remote. i mean the only thing..great product
5,I bought this for my 11 year old nephew who loves to take pictures and videos.  It’s easy for him to use and I think the overall quality of it is on par with the price.

Excellent deal and it does come with two batteries so you can record longer without having to stop and recharge battery.
5,The camera came within 2 days of ordering (Prime). The packaging was nice & secure. As soon as I popped the battery on the camera cut right on. Thus far Ive used the camera for about 2+ hrs of footage with the same charged battery. The picture is great. It’s functionable durable & affordable- you cant go wrong purchasing this camcorder!
5,I purchased the camera for my dad who is trying to document family and community history. He has found the camera easy to use.

5,i purchased this to recode my home for insurance purposes. I'm not very technology literate so it took me a while to figure out to use it but the picture quality and sound were great when completed. Great deal for the price.

The video is saved on an SD card which can be removed and inserted into your computer where the video can then be edited with Filmora or another film editor. The battery lasts a couple of hours plenty of time to do a lengthy video and the product comes with two batteries. Portable lightweight and simple to use.
5,I was looking for a camcorder that had the same aesthetic as the early/mid-2000s camcorder I had growing up and this one fit the bill perfectly. Haven't had any problems with it so far. Video quality looks great and I love the ergonomics of the device- feels comfy to use! Love it.
5,Perfect for my mini Steven Spielberg!Got this for my son who loves making his own movies and collects cameras of all sorts.He really enjoys using this fits on any standard tripod. Comes with 2 batteries.Excellent!
5,I bought this for my kids google meet class to be used as a webcamera and also wanted this to work as video camera on its own. It works much better than computer camera because it is movable on tripod.
5,Great Camcorder for its price! Glad amazon suggested this one its quality is great 1080p like it says! Glad to be able to use these on birthdays and vacations to record the moments!
5,Bought this camcorder to capture our new grandson. It is so compact that I can store in my purse. Easy to operate and I love the ability to load it all on the small memory card. I am able to film him for a long time without interruption. I also love the two rechargeable batteries that come with the camcorder. I have only charged one of the batteries and it is still running almost full.
5,I really like this camera.  I was surprised of the quality I got for the price.  It is a good alternative to trying to take video with my cell phone.  Highly recommended!!
5,The camera is great! Exactly what i was looking for it has great quality for the price! Recommended it to my sister in law too she loved it! Great camera for capturing the moment.
5,I recently purchased this camcorder for my daughter’s 10th birthday and was pleasantly surprised at the quality. So easy to use that she began making videos right away! Pairs well with the tripod we purchased. We are very happy with our purchase!
5,Incredible product for such a reasonable price. Didn't expect the zoom or picture quality to be so good in such a small lightweight camera. Videos captured are not jerky like you often see in much more expensive cameras. Would definitely recommend.
5,Camera works great got it about 2 weeks ago have been using it regularly since and there are no major problems with the camera the build quality is a bit off but aside from that it works great good battery life it's good considering you won't find a camera this great for less than 100 bucks
5,I got this present for my 11 year old. It's just enough for her age range.  Its old school but not complicated.  Only downside is it didn't come with an sd card. But it's a good buy
5,I love it all my friends kept asking where i got it and it looks so retro and vintage idk why it just gives me a vibe
5,Everything arrived in excellent condition.  and the video camera has surprised me it is the best quality that I have bought for the price.  I recommend it. It has an amazing zoom. The image stabilization is good and the quality of the photos is excellent.
5,I absolutely love this camcorder it is just perfect for filming my daughter during her gymnastics performance. Great quality picture stability and the zoom  and focus on this camera is top notch. I highly recommend this product.
5,Excellent audio quality adjusts well with changing levels of brightness. Video can be a bit laggy with movement if not recording in sports mode. Light weight and easy set up and mode changes. Would be a great first camcorder for kids.
1,Very disappointed with this product. Should not be recommended by amazon. First the package came before estimated tracking time of package which I was very pleased about. Second when I put the SD card in the camera it was hard to push and almost felt like it was going to break. Third when the camera was turned on it had a nice picture quality for the price but when I took video with it the zooming came out in spurts and was not smooth at all. Check all reviews with videos from the camera! The zoom button also makes a loud sound when the camera is recording. The sound quality was very poor when I took video with talking the talking was barely heard and you could just hear me moving the zoom button all the time. Any phone camera would be better then this. This camera is not worth it when there are phones that do a better job then this. I also compared this camera to one of our family owned camera from about 10 years back and the older camera was a lot better then this camera in all aspects. All in all this camera should not be rated 4 and a half stars.
5,This item was surprisingly good for the price paid. I bought for my son for Christmas and he absolutely loves it. The picture is clear and the camera is very shiny. I would say fun for kids and adults.
5,I love this camera. By far the best purchase i’ve made. Love absolutely LOVE the camera quality and the sound is so good. Can’t wait to record my summer with it.
5,This camera is definitely well worth the price. I've seen some of the negative reviews and don't understand why I mean this isn't a $500 video camera so if you're looking for that it's not going to be this price range. We really enjoy using this camera and my wife loves it. There's many options and the price can't be matched. Very satisfied!
4,Easy controls. Two batteries. Good quality video.
5,Love the camcorder but I can’t use it anymore bc I accidentally lost the charger in a move and now I can never use it again :( it’s brand new
5,Purchased for my 12 year old nephew. So far it's very user friendly batteries came fully charged and shipping was on time.  I like how compact it is set up was easy and very happy it comes with its own carry case.  Look forward to seeing the videos he creates. Have not interfaced with computer or TV yet but will update when he starts creating videos.
5,This camera is very good especially considering the price. It’s very easy to use and has some cool features you can plug it up to a tv or computer and watch your videos or even record while it’s showing on the tv or computer screen. The audio isn’t perfect but it gets the job done. I’d recommend especially if you’re wanting to catch little life moments.
5,This camcorder is excellent! We purchased it for my daughter for xmas and so far we have had no issues at all. Would highly recommend. These sellers were great to work with a would buy from them again
4,Great
5,Nice little camera for the price. I was looking for something to capture home videos on and found this camera to be the best. I would recommend this camera for the price.
5,Well I just got the video camera yesterday and so far so good.  Used it last night to video at a football game It's smaller than expected which is a really GOOD thing for me  and it is easy to use.
5,I have purchased this as a gift for my child and it is cheap and value for the money. I didn't expect much but it is a very light weight camcorderso they can carry and use it easily. This camera is cheap simple and can be used as a beginner's photography. Also equipped with two batteries  and even we can charge the battery during usage time as well. Picture quality is good according to the price.
5,I bought this camera for my daughter I was pleasantly surprised and the first impression started with the package well packed for safe delivery and quality of the camera was excellent for the price I paid. It has twin mode for video and Picture with dedicated buttons for every function. Above all the battery life is excellent I don’t have to ask for anything more. EXCELLENT PRODUCT
5,Get a better camera instead
5,Great camera! Had a name brand camera which needed a new battery but this was a way better deal! Couldn't be happier. Ordered for recording Christmas videos of the children. Works good and user friendly! Would recommend its a great deal!!
5,This camera is amazing. Trying to start a YouTube channel and couldn’t afford a bigger camera but fortunately this serves me everyday and it’s exactly what I want. Will highly recommend it.
5,Great quality for the price it is a good camera and easy to use it is a good investment if are looking for a starter camera for vlogging or even just recording memories.
5,Love this camcorder. Have super good quality videos and pictures. My pictures came out sooo good. I thought it came from my phone. Let me talk about the videos. They have the best quality. Love how its a easy functional recorder. Where all ages can use this item. Came package sooo nicely and everything were just perfect.  If i could order all their stock of this i would. You will not regret it one bit
5,Due to the pandemic the order was pushed back so medical supplies can get out faster. But the seller was VERY communicative every step of the way. Once confirmed the estimated delivery date it came on the exact date first thing in the morning.Everything came as described and the product works great. Can't wait to add accessories.
5,I love the camera overall.. Its mainly for my son to do YouTube and he is 10 so it’s very easy for him to use.. Quality is acceptable buttons are easy to use and lightweight to carry around.. Great product..
5,This was perfect for my kids. They like to film and vlog themselves. I didn't want to spend a ton of money because they are fairly young still. This camera satisfies their needs to film. It is easy to navigate the cameras functions for my 7 year old. It is a good little starter camera until I feel like they are old enough for something higher priced.
5,I use to camcorder to recorder videos. It's much better than my other camera because i'd have to charge it with it charger for a long time.  But when I was charging the camera with it's battery it didn't even take that long I'd say the charging to maybe around 1-10 minutes maybe less. But i really love the fact that it turns off by itself.
5,I'm reviewing this product not for my personal use but for someone who is just getting into video-recording. I think it's quite easy to use and carry around. It would be a nice gift for younger teenagers and children who want to play around with video-recording. I personally wouldn't use this for myself but I think for the price and quality it's good enough of a camcorder for beginners to play with.
5,I liked this product!! It’s easy to use! I wish it would take pictures while recording but all in all it has been great so far!!! I needed something quick and that could record and take photos and it did!!
2,This is not the best.  The zoom function doesn’t work I’m pretty sure it’s just for looks.  The stabilization was bad.  I was cold so the shivering didn’t help but it still was not good even when I wasn’t shivering.  Price was good but I got what I paid for.
5,This is the perfect camcorder! I bought it to use as a way to document a road trip me and my friends went on and it did the job. Great quality for the price seeing as most other camcorders I was seeing were $200+ and something I couldn’t pay at the time. I was able to use a 64gb SD card and got 5.5 hours of video! It’s an amazing little thing to make home videos on.
5,Got this camera for Christmas for my daughter.  She absolutely loves it. Its easy to use and great video and picture quality. Comes with 2 batteries and little case to store it. Great camera for the price.
5,The product arrived fast! Has a nice case to keep the camera in. I purchased this as a birthday gift for my mom and she loves. It has everything she needs to record family events.
5,This little cam/corder is perfect for my needs.  Has worked perfectly with very fine recordings.I would recommend this camera to any family that wanted to have digital history of their family
5,This thing is nice and compact for sure we have used it a couple times now and it seems to be of good value for the money. We will be using this lots as time goes on! I also like the fact you can snap pictures with this too. great feature for sure!
5,My son loves this camera and has been using it all the time since Christmas. It's very durable and good quality for the price and easy for him to use. I would definitely recommend this product
5,It really works well and is a great camera has an aesthetic vibe to it. Not high quality video but I think it makes it kind of better.
5,We gifted this to my six year old nephew for Christmas...he LOVED it! He's been really into creating videos on my sisters phone so I thought a simple easy to use and affordable videocamera was the way to go. We helped setup the camera for him & after that he was able to use it all by himself. Thinking about purchasing for myself as well.
5,This is my first camcorder purchase and as a new user I love how simple it is to use. It does what I need it to do and I am happy that I found a product that has been simple to figure out. Highly recommended!
5,Great camcorder so far. Bought this camcorder so I could record my children for my father. He doesn't live close by to visit his grandchildren whenever he wants. This way he doesn't miss anything.
1,Tried to video a football game. Image qualitywhile zooming is so bad you can’t differentiate jersey #’s.
5,Looking for a small beginners video recorder to start my YouTube channel and this will be perfect. Lightweight  easy to use and a great quality. Looked at other reviews and the review from the man that post his video SOLD me.. ThanksHappy so Far!

5,I purchased this camera to record student auditions for musical showcases. It has been awesome! It is so easy to use and I love that it comes with two batteries. When one battery ran out of charge I could just pop the second one in and charge them both in the evening. For the price this is an excellent camera. Definitely met my needs.
5,I purchased this camera for my parents birthday gift and they loved it! They plan on taking it on their Hawaiian vacation because it's compact. They were excited that it also takes photos.
5,Love my camera and definitely would recommend for purchase! Very light weigh and super easy to use ! Shipping was great as well - arrived exactly when it was supposed to
5,Super light weight many accessories. Exactly what I was looking for for my son to shoot videos. It came really fast and has two batteries!
3,For a cheap camera this is ok. The video quality is fine but there's something weird about the frame rate. Also the zoom is only digital which again is fine for a cheap camera. The output files are .AVI
5,Overall this is a great camcorder! When you zoom in a lot it gets a little blurry but otherwise the camera quality is really good! Great for capturing summer memories!
5,I bought this video camera for my 8 year old who was constantly stealing my phone camera and taking video.  It works great!  He was able to figure out how to work it very fast and and immediately started filming action movies of his younger brother.  The battery lasts quite a bit but it is great to have an extra.
5,I haven't really used it as much as I want to yet but it seems to work pretty well. I wish there was a headphone jack on the camera so I could watch what I recorded more quietly. Other than that it works well and isn't too expensive for a decent digital camera.
5,I love it so far it is great quality
5,Great Camcorder for the Price. For the price you get so much more than you pay for. The image quality is awesome.  In addition it's extremely easy to use. This camera/camcorder is great for new beginners because its truly user friendly. The camera comes full of accessories: USB cable video cables charger 2 batteries and neat little case. It works with any SD card 32 GB and less or a micro SD with an adapter.
5,Good camera for the price. I love the fact that it has a few different modes. The images were a little fuzzy but after adjusting the settings it was much better. It is kid friendly and extremely light weight!
5,I bought my wife this camera because she’s been wanting a camcorder to record memories. The price is excellent and quality is great. I downloaded the video into my computer and quality is even greater.
5,I'm using this camera to record videos for youtube! The image quality is great even when you zoom in! So far the stabilization is also really good! Would 10/10 recommend as a starter video camera!
5,We love everything about the video camera. Very easy for a 7 year old to use
5,For the price point this camera offers a great variety of basic and advanced features that are competent. Bought it as a gift for my little cousin who's obsessed with recording videos and blogs for social media. Overall this product is most adequate for anyone wanting an affordable camera with good functions.
5,I used the camcorder to record my daughter’s birthday. I was sold on the zoom and picture quality really nice.  Transfer to my pc was easy. No blurry pictures
5,I love this camcorder. I am using it to record my summer adventures and I am super excited! If you are on the fence about getting it don’t hesitate!
5,When buying a camcorder for the first time I was a little unsure of what exactly to get. This camera is pretty much amazing! It's very user friendly and the manual is very clear; the battery life is wonderful and the image quality is great. Sound is very clear too. All in all I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a fantastic camera at a great price.
5,Excellent video recorder at a great price. I am currently using this to record my lessons for students to view remotely. It’s easy to maneuver and navigate. I would highly recommend this item to any teachers/instructors if you are looking into building your video pile for remote learning.
5,It was very easy to use . One thing you will have to do is buy a SD card in order to use it . very light  comfortable to hold  easy to use for any age .... i would deffinatly purchase another one.
5,Todo perfecto con la video cámara
5,I was looking for a low-priced video recorder to use in my youtube videos and I can't believe the value of this item. Good recorder does what I needed. I won't be using the zoom function because I don't need it but it feels just a little jumpy. For my purposes what a great camera!
5,It's no doubt the best product in this price range. the camera works well and solid as expected. Five star for sure!
5,I received the camcorder almost a week ahead of the scheduled date. It is a great little camcorder. Since I've gotten it I can't seem to put it down. With the Summer ending the only regret is that I didn't get it sooner. I'm looking to take on a few responsibilities here and there and this cam will really come in handy. Look forward to doing more business with this company. Thanks much.
5,Love the product so far really appreciate all the different colorings and filters!
5,I travel often for work and wanted a small easy-to-use video recorder. Luckily I came across this one on Amazon. I'm glad to report that you can expect much better quality videos than iPhone videos. Now that it's spring I'll be using it often to take cute videos to send my family and friends who live afar. If you're looking for a decently priced video cam that's easy-to-use and not too space consuming I recommend this one!

5,This camera was a great bargain I got it during a flash sale for only forty-five bucks. We got it for my son for Christmas he was able to use it right out of the box and along with the SD card he has been getting hours of use out of it. Such a great bargain and would definitely recommend an purchase again.
5,I got this camera for my daughter that wants to start vlogging. I will have to say fir the price this is a really nice camera. The imaging is clear and it is easy to use without a manual. It appears to be somewhat bulky looking online but it's quite compact in person. It can fit in an average size purse with ease.
5,Seems to be a good camera it's pretty new to us still. The quality of the picture on the screen doesn't seem to be great but not sure the quality once transffered over to the computer.

5,For the price its not a bad camera. Small and compact. Video and audio quality when played back on a tv is suprisingly good. Playback on the device is not that good. Only gripe i have is the zoom is not smooth when going in and out. It is super chopy when zooming. Overall im happy with it for the price!
2,I read the reviews before I bought this and thought this was a decent first camera for using for my YouTube stuff. Man was I wrong.This piece of crap has no concept of "focus". I bought it to film my bullet journal stuff at my desk which puts the object I'm trying to film about 1 foot to 2 feet away from the camera. Everything came out blurred as hell and illegible.Do NOT buy this camera. Save your money and invest in something worth your money and time. Did get a full refund though so that was at least a small bonus.
5,I bought this camera for my parents so that they could have better audio and picture quality. I was not disappointed for what is a relatively low price compared to most camcorders the quality quite high. If I ever find myself in need of a camera I would most likely buy this one.
5,My 6 year old grandson who can't sit still for more than a minute was always wanting to use his mother's phone to take videos. I bought this video camera as a present. Now he can take videos anytime he wants.1. Easy to use even for a 6 year old.2. Affordable3. Great option for kids who like to be busy and creative.
5,I bought this product to capture my birth and I am very excited that this camcorder is easy to use and affordable. It comes with 2 batteries and a really nice case. Camcorder can even fit in my purse for a quick grab.im glad I purchased this product.
1,I’ve been an Amazon prime for 5 years this is the first time I’ve ever returned something! Very frustrated with this camcorder. First it came with no batteries and it took a while to get them. There are very minimal instructions that come with it. And there is NO phone number to. All for tech support. I was doing a lot of U tube to figure out how to use this. Finally got it going very disappointed in the sound basically no sound. I always check out reviews before I buy which were pretty good for this product but I definitely would not recommend this product. I still want a camcorder to record my granddaughter but Leary of buying again thru the mail may have to go to BestBuy were there is some support if you have problems
5,We used this camera to record a musical event. My colleagues and I expected there to be some glitches at the low cost of the camera. We were quite surprised at the sound and video quality! I am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone looking for a great deal!!
5,Bought this item as a gift I tested out all the features and seemed to work well. For the price I think it's a nice camera and would be great especially for people who are learning how to use video cameras.
4,No dislike
5,It comes with a case and you can adjust the strap . it comes with 2 batteries and charging cable. it a perfect camcorder.
5,I am very pleased with this product. It arrived as scheduled. I purchased this for my daughter as a Christmas gift and she was very happy and pleased. She can’t wait to get started recording!
5,If you don't like crappy Camcorders then get this one. This will help all of your needs and make things a lot better.
5,I absolutely love the FULL Video Camcorder and this product is awesome.  It is pretty small and very light.The Camcorder is easy to set up.  What you need to do is only charging the battery by using the included adapter.and inserting an SD card that you have purchased separately in advance. The Video quality is great.Overall the FULL Video Camcorder is excellent and is worth the money.
5,great quality. I am happy with the purchase.
5,This is a good little starter camera. We bought this camcorder primarily for the purpose of creating home videos of our kids so this camera works great for this basic function. We are very new to camcorders so I appreciate how easy it is to use.
5,This camera is super easy to use.  I found the menu to be intuitive and easy to understand.  Picture quality is excellent. So far battery has held charge really well.
5,Camera works great.  This is exactly what I expected.  The batter lasts around a hour and you get two of them.  The quality is 1080p as advertised.  If you are looking for an inexpensive camera with 1080p quality I would recommend this one.
5,I like that it is perfect for my 7 year old who loves to video everything.  She was very happy and pleased. Perfect for her little hands to and also great for my bigger hands.
5,Out of box looks good
5,I ordered this camera for my son. He loves to make fun videos. The quality is great! Picture is clear sound is great. He loves that the screen can flip so he can see himself! I would definitely recommend this camcorder! It also comes with a case and extra battery! For the price it was definitely a steal!
5,I love this great camera as it is easy for my inexperience and my arms are not strong so I appreciate the fact that itis not heavy and easy to use!! I recommend for young and old for many reasons.  I was lucky to come across this oneby chance.
5,I got this for my 9 year old daughter. She absolutely loved it! She loves taking videos and pretending she’s a video blogger. This was an easy setup and she is happy with her gift !
5,Really small and lightweight compared to my old camera
5,The camcorder zoom image stabilization and picture quality surprised me. The videos have high resolution. It’s very compact and small and it’s great for on the go adventures. The camcorder comes with a USB charging cord two external batteries and case. I’m obsessed with my camcorder. It’s giving me early 2000s vibes.
5,We bought this as a gift for our teenage daughter. She loves it so much she is constantly recording memorable family moments. I would recommend this for your personal use or as a gift to a special person.
5,Have this to make memories and also for my ten year old nephew to use as well if/when he wants to. Creates great bright memories
5,Great camera. Very easy to use with excellent picture quantity. Our 5 year old grandson made a recording with the camera like he was on a movie set. The image stabilizer made it look professional.
5,This was a gift for my 11 year old. He loves to make movies and edit them. He has become frustrated with the quality of movies made with his iPad and iPhone so we purchased this camera. He LOVES it. It works well is easy to use and creates movies of good quality. Now my husband wants one of his own!
5,Nice camera. Bought for our daughter to start making videos. Product is as described and has worked fine since delivered. I would look no further if you are looking for a good entry level camera.
5,My 10 year old loves it! The packaging was secure. It arrived right on schedule. I purchased this product for my daughter who has sparked an interest in youtubing The product is very beginner friendly.
5,This camecorder is everything we imagined! The quality is amazing the design is sleek and simple. I love it so much! Definitely worth the price what a steal!
5,I bought this for my granddaughter as she in a filming class and it is awesome got her a A on her assignment. It's a great buy. Thanks Amazon
5,The product is just what we were looking for to capture memories of our growing family! I love how compact it is and the small storage bag is perfect! Great product for a great price!
3,Camera has great digital images but sound is horrible and it does not support external microphone so to me it is useless wish I had returned it before the date to return wasted my money
5,I like  the size the storage case and the focus and the picture quality not too much self memories is what I dislike
5,So I got this for my 8yr old son. And it was perfect. Very good quality at an amazing price. I purchased a SD card as well so that he can use right away. I love how it comes with a case to hold it. Thank you seller
5,We bought this camcorder for our 9 year son for Christmas and he loves it!  It’s small so it fits easily in his hand and the quality of the pictures is very good!
5,Like
5,I bought this product for my 8 year old and it is the perfect camera for that age.
5,Bought this to capture videos of my kids rather than just having videos on my phone! Great quality great price! Very efficient service from the sales team!
5,This is a great camcorder! It's better quality than anything else this price! You can record HD video to an SD card (32 gb or less) and this is a great upgrade from those older tape-recording video cameras. The ability to record in digital saves so much time. 10 out of 10 would totally recommend!
5,The size of the camera makes it easy to pack and the protective case ensures product safety at all times. This camera has a wide range of uses; anywhere from home videos to outdoor adventures. I would recommend this product for anyone who wants to record more of lifes memories.
5,I wasn't expecting much when I bought this camera but it has far exceeded my expectations. Solid build and great feature set for a camera in this price range. The image quality is surprisingly good especially in daylight. You will not be disappointed. Camera comes with 2 batteries and they lasted longer than my daughters softball game.  Great product for the price. Purchase with confidence.
5,My 7 year old cried when she got this!!  It's super easy to use and kid friendly!!  She video tapes wherever she goes...lol
5,great camera! the zoom image stabilization and picture quality are all good. this camera is wonderful it’s exactly what i was looking for.
5,I really like this camera.  It is very easy to use and the recordings are very good.  I use it to record presentations and the audio and video are very good.  I highly recommend it.
5,Camcorder functions well. Very nice fit in my hand. Can't wait to start filming the cooking videos the kids and I want to do!!! Thanks for the reliable product at a great price and quick shipping.
5,Esta cámara me es.muy útil para mi trabajo es fácil de usar cómoda para llevar ya que es muy liviana se adapta perfectamente a mi mano la resolución es perfecta.Soy Artista manual y para grabar las clases de mi trabajo es perfecta cumple todas mis espectativas la recomiendo a ojos cerrados
2,I liked the price but I couldn't see any high definition except for the HD images on the box the camera came in.  I was using a Sony Handy Cam before I purchased this "HD" camera and I had to get another one of those in the end.  It might have had to do with the lighting in the room but people told me the audio was not as good as the Sony camera too. I set up my computer to play two windows at the same time with videos playing from each camera.  After doing that I ordered a new Handycam camera.
5,I bought this for my 8 year old daughter because she loves to record herself dancing. She loves it! It’s easy to use. Definitely a great deal! The videos come out great.
5,This product is really amazing for the price. The quality is great its small enough where you can take it with you anywhere and I'm a beginner with all of this so it's nice to see how all the functions are easily accessible and not complicated like most can be.
5,This is a great entry level camera! A lot of options to choose from for the price! The menu can get a little confusing but after using it for awhile you learn how to navigate it.
5,Perfect for beginners! We recently got this camera for my husband’s future YouTube channel. It is super easy to use even though this is my first time using this type of camera. Highly recommend for those just starting out!
5,I brought this as a christmas gift for my son who likes creating videos and he also wants too make movies. It is lightweight small and easy to handle. Great buy definitely worth it!
5,My son is going to love this product. Nice packaging and great quality especially for the price. The only thing that would of made it better would of been a cover for the lens.
5,This camera did everything that I was hoping for and for the price is amazing.  I wanted a camera to take home videos and this is the perfect one.  It is lightweight picks up audio really well has a good zoom and with two batteries I never have to worry about missing out on a single moment.
5,I always wanted a camcorder and this one is great. It took me a minute to figure out you need a memory card. Once I purchased that it worked like a charm. I recommend this product especially for the price.
5,I just gave this video camera to my granddaughter for her 10th birthday and she loved it! The camera is perfectly compact with all the necessary features: zoom lens editing photo or video selection etc. The ease of usage and the quality of pictures was remarkable for the price. I am so pleased with this purchase and my granddaughter is over the moon with delight!
5,Pretty nice camcorder! I wanted a camera to take little videos of my friends and I in cosplay and I think this will work perfectly! Wonderful budget camera.
5,I bought this camcorder for my 8 year old. It was super easy to use and the quality was amazing! He loves it. Great camcorder for someone just learning how to record videos and take pictures.
5,This is amazing. Easy to use and great picture quality. Bought this for some fun family vlogging for us to look back on in the future and it’s now a daily fun item we use for just about everything .
5,The camera was very easy to use. My 7 and 11yr operates it with ease. The instructions are self explanatory. But when in doubt just play around with it and bit. You will get the hang of the features quickly.
5,I just needed a simple/basic digital camcorder and this camera fits the ticket.  The price is great.  If you play back a video on the camera screen the sound isn't the best but when you play back on computer it sounds much better.  I like that it comes with two batteries. This product does what it should for a beginner/amateur.
5,Great little camera. Its all you need. The audio is a bit low in the camera but is good quality once I play it onto my computer.  Its a good camera for the price. It also has options to enhance image and video quality.
5,I love everything and it’s tiny enough to carry anywhere
5,I am so glad I got this. I got it for recording process videos but it will be great for everything. Super lightweight was not a burden at all. The quality looks as good as it would have been from my phone.
1,I purchased this based off the large number of 5 star reviews. Upon receipt there was a gift card offer which I've always found to be fishy.Upon use I found that the advertised battery life isn't anywhere close to what it actually was. At a full charge it was nearly dead after 30 minutes.The audio quality was poor at best. At first I thought it was due to codec issues for my computer or a corrupted SD card but after testing multiple cards and updating software the issue still remained (no matter which video player I tested in).Though I can't prove it I highly doubt the rating for this product was obtained by reviews not generated without the gift card incentive.Product return had been requested and I'll be searching for something name brand like Sony.
5,I got this camera to start vlogging and start a YouTube channel. The value for what you get is amazing no this isn't a Sony or a Canon. But for less than $70 you get an HD camcorder with two batteries all you need is an SD card. This is a ridiculous value for anyone starting up their own vlog. Highly recommend as a starter camera!
5,Great camcorder. Picture quality is good for the price. Easy to hook up to computer to transfer photos and videos.
2,The camera is okay but the sound is terrible
5,This little video camera is amazing!I got this for my daughter for Christmas this year and she absolutely loves it! Now her and her friends can make their own YouTube videosThe picture quality on this camera is nice and there's a slot for am SD card so you can store/save your videosWould def buy again! Thanks!
5,Great Quality For Its Price!! Perfect size to take with you on the go and love that it comes with its case and an extra battery as well ! Recommend!!!!
5,The camera functions very well and the quality is amazing for the price point. I was looking for something to start a Youtube channel and this does the job for those starting out. I must note that an SD card is not included because I overlooked this but overall worth the money!
5,For the price we didn’t know if camera would be significant.  We were so presently surprised that it is an excellent camera for the money.  We highly recommend this camera.
5,This is a great product for the price. I ordered this camcorder for my husband and he was like a kid in a candy store. The photos and videos he made were of very good quality. The camcorder is compact enough to fit in a purse suitcase and backpack. We are both very pleased with this camcorder. Highly recommended.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             For the price this camera works well
5,This is a great camcorder for this price. I purchased it so my son could make gaming videos and volg and he is loving it. Has all the basic functions. He said being able to pause a recording then pick back up and record a continual video is pretty cool. Overall very happy with this purchase.
5,We bought this for our ten year old son and are very happy with it. It is intuitive to use and works very well. The image quality is very good and the materials don’t seem cheap either. A very good purchase!
5,A nice and simple camera that's easy to use.

5,Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it. I got to play around with it for a while and check out the features and how it operates. It’s a fantastic deal for the money. I only needed to buy a HD SD card. It came with 2 rechargeable batteries and a wall charger.
5,This camcorder is absolutely great!  It is a great size to carry with you.  The recordings are clear and very vivid.  This camcorder is a great value and easy to use.  I recommend this product!  Dave
5,I bought this camcorder for my 8 year old son to "vlog" with.  He follows several famous Youtubers (DanTDM Denis etc...) and has a passion for making his own vlog videos and screen recordings of him playing games.  This is a great camcorder for the price.
5,I wish there was a focus button but other than that this is a great product for when you are in a pinch!
5,It’s worth for what it’s cost. I use camera for my school project and it did what I need it for. Good picture quality user-friendly highly recommended!
5,Cute nice functional camera. Nice zoom and picture the battery seems to last a long time. Just needs a little pocket on the case for the batteries.
5,They could have made the picture quality a bit better but other than that great product!
5,Really enjoy this great camcorder! It has awesome quality quick charging with 2 long lasting batteries screen flip feature for when you are filming yourself and very sleek design! So glad to have it to capture our precious moments.
5,I bought this for my son who is 8 and likes to make videos for his You tube channel. I wanted something reasonably priced that he could use to make videos but it also needed to be good quality in case I wanted to use it to make movies of our two younger girls. This fit that bill perfectly!
5,for the price everything is pretty good and i love the size. The 2 batteries are great and camera quality is decent.
5,I enjoy using the product and it works really well I definitely recommend
5,I really like the picture quality it is very clear. I got this camera for my son to do home videos with the family. He is enjoying it more than I thought.

5,I bought this camcorder to record my grandkids. The zoom and picture quality are excellent!!  I am very pleased with this product!!
5,We love our new camcorder! We got it to document our new addition arriving in October since our families can’t visit us in the hospital because of Covid. Its really easy to use and has great picture quality! Perfect for us!
5,Absolutely love this product the quality is great and the zoom works perfect! Great product for the summer with amazing image stabilization
5,The quality is good for the price! Very pleased - fun for little videos of friends & family :)
5,I bought this one for my niece for her birthday. She really likes it. The quality is good compare to the price. It's very lightweight compact and easy to use. If you want something inexpensive for kid or famiy traveling. This one definitely a good choice.
5,My 9 year old recently got interested in making his own movies so we got him this cheap camera.  He loves it - feels like a pro and loves taking videos.  Bonus: Mom and Dad get a bunch of home videos of the kids. :) Would recommend.
5,I received my camera yesterday and I got a chance to try it out today. It is very nice small and portable. It came with a nice case two batteries a charger and a connection cable to connect to the TV and the computer. It has very good quality. It can take pictures and videos. I love it! It would make a great gift as well. Good price too!!
5,I bought this camera for my daughter who likes to vlog. It is very easy to use. The video display has great HD quality. I would highly recommend this camera to anyone.
5,Got this for my parents who wanted to record some of their Jeep rides. (I know...) It was intuitive enough for them to set up record and playback their rides on their tv at home and they’ve been absolutely raving about how clear the picture is. Great little camcorder especially for the price!

5,Love my new camrea. It is very user friendly and easy to use. Thank you for a great product
5,This is a great camcorder. It's very light which makes it easy to carry around. I like that it comes with two batteries. The case for the camera only fits the camera so I bought a $10 Sony case on Amazon and it fits the camera and all accessories.
5,This camera is light weight sturdy and records well. The sound is low and could benefit from a microphone but overall it's a nice little camera and I am very happy with my purchase and glad to have it for my daily video recordings.
1,Spend the money and buy a Sony. $90 vs $350 no comparison. To me the $90 bucks isn't worth the effort to return. I'm just going to throw it away and get another Sony. This video recorder is like something you can get out of a .25¢ bubble gum machine. A total waste.
5,This is a great starter camcorder for the price.Bought it for nephew for Christmas and loves it!Could use some space though.Would recommend for someone just get started.
5,So far we really enjoy this camera. We bought it for our 10 year old daughter and she absolutely loves this product! It seems like good quality for the price as well.

5,Video Camcorder arrived very fast. This is a great camera for beginners who want to learn. The picture quality is good and the sound is good. This camera is very compact and depending in the size of the purse or bag will take up very little room. It also comes with carrying case so that you don’t need to purchase any carrying case. Lightweight and easy to carry.
5,I love how small and compact the camera is that I can hold it in my small hands and be able to hide it when doing pranks 🤫. I love that it’s very light weight and easy to use for a beginner like me. Great camera 📷
5,I love it small and compact!

3,First one was broken. They replaced it very quickly.
5,Awesome camera

5,Ordered for a video essay works great

5,This product is wonderful!! The perfect camera for beginners who are just starting out with recording!! It isn't too complex but still has an array of functions and filming options! I got this camera for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it! It is great quality and gets the job done. I highly recommend this product.
5,I bought this for my 11 year old daughter for Christmas. This camera is small enough for her to manage and seems to be user friendly. I’m hoping she will love it!
5,The zoom on camera works great image and picture quality is nice. Has retro look to it
2,Overall I did like this little camcorder. The picture quality was good and the built in mic worked fine. I also liked the hot fix mount for overhead shooting.  With that said if you cannot record your video to the card the camcorder is useless.  I tried 3 different SD cards used the format thru the camcorder and did a full format thru my computer and the unit stopped recording at .50 seconds every time. I hav e returned the product.
5,Es bueno para un regalo más si es para una persona mayor muy fácil de usar.
5,Purchased this camera for my wife for Xmas and she loved it. She used it right away and found it very easy to use.
5,I have been using this camcorder for a few weeks now and has been very  happy with my purchase. It came nicely boxed with a free case . Looks sturdy and classy . Picture quality is very good at this price point.  I would definitely recommend this camcorder to anyone who wants to have one on a budget.
5,I have been meaning to experiment with camcorders for awhile but with no clue as to where to start. Then I stumbled upon this product and it definitely excited me enough to give it a chance !I must say for an amateur this is awesome and you will have fun :)Especially the price point as regards to it’s features is amazing !
5,Camera was for my 12 year old son he enjoys making videos for YouTube.  He figured out very quickly how to use the camera and the quality is great.  The seller is responsive as well.  I would recommend this camera for sure.
3,Teen likes it
5,Easy to set up product fairly intuitive to use. Very handy small. So far image quality is good. I have not downloaded onto computer yet to see if videos and sound quality are still good. So far for the price it is a deal
5,Love love love this camcorder. I bought it for a trip to Ireland and pre-trip tested it out with the kiddos. Pretty good quality of pictures durable and I love the carrying case it came with. Has a starp on it so I used a carabineer to clip to my backpack. Wonderful
5,This was so easy to use! Make sure you have an SD card though. Phone camera are great for spontaneous recording but you really can't beat a good quality camcorder for special events and captaining memories.Picture is clear (on the screen and on the TV/computer playback) not shaky and was ready to use. My teenage son thought it was so cool (he only knows phone camera lol).
5,For the price this is great little camera for my son to start making videos with. He was able to figure it out quick and start making videos the first day.

5,I absolutely love this! Works great! Great quality! Has effects & I cannot wait to document my kiddos growing up!!

5,I purchased this for my 13 year old daughter who expressed an interest in filming. It is a good camcorder for the price. She loves it. The only thing is that you can not record anything without first inserting an SD card.
5,My son got this for a Christmas gift from his grandparents and it’s excellent quality and takes great videos. Battery life is great and he is loving it
4,Camera arrived with issue but company rectified the issue. Very happy about it :)

5,Perfect little camera to record whatever you wanted. Absolutely in love with it and can’t wait to use it more!
5,It's a $60 so you get what you pay for. Still it is a really nice camera overall. It just needs some work on the zoom. It needs to be smoother when it closing up.
5,Super easy to use and great for the price! Wonderful video quality with sharp and colorful images. Perfect for home videos.
5,I love this camcorder soo much and can’t wait to use it ALL summer long when hanging out with my friends !!

5,It is an excellent camera in general. It is easy to use with very simple buttons. Its weight is relatively light to be able to record more time with the camera in hand. It comes with two rechargeable batteries which is very useful when it comes to using it outdoors.
5,I love the camcorder. It came at a timely manor and the product is great. It's exactly what is suspected with great camera quality. It is also computable with selfy sticks so you don't have to hold it if you don't want to.
5,This is an awesome start up camera. Easy to use easy to set up! The video quality is great. I am very pleased with this purchase
5,My wife loves the camera and the quality of the pictures as well as the video On the Camcorder. It is lite weight and very easy to handle. I recommend it to anyone.
2,The audio is atrocious but that is not why I purchased this camcorder. I knew the audio was bad but wanted to use an external microphone and audio interface with it. However when I tried to sync the audio using various programs I found out that the framerate changes each video. One said 30.90 fps. One said 31.40 fps. This makes it impossible to sync audio which is almost mandatory because the audio quality is awful. If you want to film video without audio this is a great budget camera. However I dont know anyone who wants to film a video without audio.
1,This "camera" is truly worthless in ever possible way:1. On the first one I received the "camera" flatly refused either to detect the SD card or to eject the card.Result: Utterly useless.So I thought (stupidly) that I would simply exchange it for another one.Wrong answer.2. Second one arrived - same result.  Refuses to detect card *and* "flap" over card slot refuses to stay closed (same as before).This time I tried *two* different cards - thinking possibly that the device just didn't "like" the 32 GB.  Other card I tried was a 16 GB MicroSD/adapter combo I happened to have lying around - which will *NOT* come out of the card slot (exactly the problem I had with the initial camera for which I exchanged this one.Next "cute" thing?  viewfinder *literally broke off of the camera itself* - in a (vain) attempt retrieve the SD card adapter I mentioned previously.Don't even *think* that this sub-mediocrity actually qualifies as a "video camera" - in any sense of the word.
5,I purchased this item for my brother and he told that it is very good product. He liked it and would buy another one and recommend me to get it.Thank you so much.
5,I really like the picture quality.  It is very clear.  The camera is easy to use  I am choosing option two
5,Based off the value of this video camera it's worth it! It does what I need. Easy to use and I love how it comes with 2 batteries.
5,This camcorder is perfect size and quality for me and can bring everywhere! The audio is clear and simple to use! Highly recommend!
5,Purchased this because of the great price and was surprised of how well this camera worked!  It is the perfect size and won't take up much room when packed. Would purchase again!
5,I love this camera! The screen resolution is great. I used it for the first time yesterday to record one of my YouTube videos and it looked very professional. I was a little unsure about how the quality would be because the camera wasn't expensive but it turned out great! I would recommend this to all new vloggers or YouTubers.
5,Great camera for the price excited to use it to make memories and family videos!
5,Bought this camera for my 5 year old daughter.  The camera fits perfectly in her hands and is very easy for her to operate and figure out.  Good picture with the right amount of lighting.  Easy to carry with you anywhere.  A great starter recorder for a future video maker!  Great deal for the price!
5,I wish it came with the sm card. But so far my daughter loves it.
5,I loved the quality of the videos and the size of the camera super easy to carry around
5,I receive it a well designed and hard box. It seems easy to operate. Recommend the 32gb as card which gives over 8000 photos and 2.40hr video time. The menu functions easily. For the price it seems like a great product. The video is clear and you can’t hear audio. If they added a boom mic it would be a great addition.
5,Easy to use open and go!Love the fact that it come with two batteries.Got it for my husband to teach our teen how to take videos and edit them and I think its going to work great for our needs!
5,I love this camcorder it’s small and perfect for my 6 year old who wants to start her own YouTube channel. She can operate it independently as it’s pretty straightforward.
5,This did not come with a charging cable (and it's non-standard).UPDATE: Even though the initial review was posted after the return period (it was purchased as a gift) the supplier went out of their way to make sure my camcorder had  everything I needed to make things right!  It was awesome to see this level of commitment to their customers! Five Stars!
5,Bought for my granddaughter that loves you tube and wants to make her own movies. She loves the camera.  She has autism so it needed to be easy to use and she started right away making her films.  Just make sure you have a SD card for filming. I would definitely recommend this camera.
5,I bought this for a gift for my nephew beautiful and wonderful camera! Very impressed. Great quality and great price. Very happy with this purchase and I know he is going to loveeeee it!
5,This is the second video camera I've ever had. I wanted something to take videos on other than my phone. I've been using it since it arrived and I absolutely love it. I love that it's smaller as well so it's easier to transport when I need it.
5,I got this camera for my 9 year old to start her YouTube channel. It’s a little smaller then I expected but it does the job just fine.
5,We were not expecting the product we got for the price we paid. This camera is amazing it’s for my son and he is going to LOVE it. Thank you so much!!
5,We got this camera for my son for Christmas to make videos and he absolutely loves it. Works reliably and the battery life is great.

4,It’s basic not HD but if your not into high quality video’s and maybe a first time blogger this video camera is for you

3,I am disappointed.  Some parts broke almost a week after we got it.  The card is difficult to insert and remove...
5,I'm using this for projects when I'm out on the road. On the road things can break and for this price I don't mind. Very easy to use small and lightweight. It's better than my mobile phone to take videos. The two batteries are great too!Ships really fast and is friendly in communication. I'm very happy with this purchase.

5,Just got the product and already loving it. It has a comfortable grip when holding the camera. Just starting my YouTube channel and this is definitely great for beginners. I’m not too tech savy but this camcorder is working great. It even hooks up to any tripod which made recording a lot easier.

5,Got this camera for our kids to use and discover with. It’s been working great out of the box. Simple to use and fun for them to try photos as well as videos. Note it does not come with a lens cap or SD card.
5,Ordered this camera for my daughter who likes to blog. It works pretty good for the price. Overall picture quality is great for a 10 year old.
5,This works perfect for recording all my class lectures; it's lightweight comes with its own carrier and has an extra rechargable battery. The battery power lasts long and recharges quick. I was recording for about 2 hours straight and it only was 1/3 of the way gone. Only about 15 minutes of charging to get it back up to full.
3,Don't like the fact that the battery has to be in the camera to charge. We use it for wrestling tournament and the 2 batteries will not last all day. We are not able to record will charging. Besides that it is a good camera.
5,The sound is not very loud but for the price it is a good quality camera .I just became a grand father and bought this item to get video of my grandson growing up . You can also take still pictures.Camera is very easy to use.
5,It very sturdy and feel comfortable in my hand and the qua Is very good
5,Purchased this for my son as a gift so I haven't had the chance to use it. It arrived on time and was well packaged love that it has two batteries and a flash.I'm sure my son will enjoy this camera since he takes a lot of videos and photos with my cellphone.
5,This camera was a gift for a budding adolescent family historian. It's a great camera to start her off. We originally purchased a different brand on Amazon but it was not the same quality as this one. She loves that it also has a light for night recordings and an extra battery. It also plugs into the TV really easily to review all that she has documented.
5,The only thing is that the plastic case of the camera seems to be a little fragile or not sturdy. Afraid that it will break if I bump it on the counter. But the picture sound and battery life is very good for the price point and with how many features it comes with. You need to get your own sd card.
5,It’s a good cam recorder for the price and size ! Definitely recommend if you have a budget.
5,I love how lightweight and compact this product is. It almost fits the palm of my hand! Very portable! Good quality but you will need some good lights to make it even better! I also love the functionality of it as a webcam. It works on both Windows and Mac. Overall a good choice if you want to get into filming!
3,The camera was pretty cool but it didn’t work with me because the audio was really bad and staticky. That was the only problem i had wish it could have worked out for me
5,I always read reviews for items and this item blew my mind! Highly recommend picture video quality and sound are 100%
5,I'm using this as a second camcorder to record a different angle of a video.  I only wish the zoom focused better when zooming in. Overall it will work for what I need.
5,Got this for my son as a Christmas gift so that he could begin his vlogs and he Loves it!! Great quality easy to hold steady
5,This camera is great the quality is ok but its nothing you can't fix with a little help. Also it came fast and was packaged great. The two batteries were a great idea and the batteries last longer too. This is not a professional camera but I love it very portable and it even comes with a case. Love it! It was worth it.
5,I am extremely happy with my purchase. The camcorder exceeded my expectations in every way. There were clear instructions on use and there were some features that I am super excited about. I highly recommend this product. Worth every penny!

5,good quality it comes with two batteries which is amazing and easy to use
5,This camera is wonderful for my preteen daughter to Vlog.  Very happy with the purchase and store the camera was bought from.

5,In this day an age a cam corder is appreciated. It has all the features you need to take proper video footage of any an all memorable moments in your life without the added replacement risk a phone would carry. The quality is excellent and the SD card slot makes it easy to move files from cam to computer. It's very easy to use as well!

5,I loved the quality of the camera. The video quality is great and its very comfortable to hold and runs very nicely.
5,Simplicity at its best.. worth the price.. camera case fits camera perfectly.
5,Got this for my 15 year old and she LOVES it!! Great buy!!
5,What a great video camera! Great price and easy to use! Been taking family videos with it and my 8 year old loves it too!
3,Video quality sucks in indoor light I'll check in the daylight if it's any different. Also the there is sucky looking text that I dont know how to get rid of does not look professional.  With all the hyped up stars it had felt disappointed.
5,The product could came a additional battery charger tool to charger camcorder battery.
5,Got this camcorder for my young nephew. It’s good quality for the price. It does not come with a memory card (typically they don’t).

5,I love the camera does everything I need it to.
4,If you are holding it very hard to stay still.
1,I get the whole "this isn't professional-quality equipment" thing but the picture quality is ABYSMAL.  Sure - price is reasonable but this camera is completely useless.  Frustrated at myself for missing the return window because I'll never be able to do anything with this poor excuse for a camera.
5,I ordered this for my 9 year old son’s birthday! It is very easy for him to use and manage. It’s small enough yet sturdy enough for him to handle. He likes to make videos of his action figures and Legos it’s perfect!
5,This is a great little camcorder that gets the job done for home videos or in my application documenting work meetings. The picture quality would likely not be sufficient for films but is plenty good enough for casual applications. I like that the camcorder can record while charging because a previous camcorder I had did not allow both functions.
5,I absolutely love the fact this video camera is very user friendly the picture and sound quality are both top notch. I used it to film my short film and all the footage came out great. I also like the fact it could record audio which comes in handy. All in all this was a great purchase.
5,This product is what I was looking for. For my son to start learning to make videos. Only issue was getting the SD card inserted but that may have been user error
5,You will not be disappointed. Records videos in decent quality. I bought for a specific purpose and it did not disappoint. I get so much joy from this
1,This product is junk! You can tell from holding it how low quality it is. It is too small it fits awkwardly in your hand. It zooms in fine but zooming back out was a struggle. When I tilt the camera back and forth I can hear something inside of it loose.As if that wasn't enough the pouch it somes with doesn't fit the camera with the battery in it. Also no lens cover! I wouldn't buy this product again very disappointed with this item. Spend the extra money for better quality.
5,We received this camcorder and it’s everything my son been wanting . Soo satisfied it even came in this cute box with 2 batteries to charge . Love it !!
5,Picture quality is pretty good. Small and lightweight. Easy to transport. No complaints.
5,I am in love with this camcorder it was a gift for my daughter birthday she hasn’t put it down yet. Vlog for YouTube all the time

5,The product is good As follows
5,This is a great product. Clear picture and such a great quality camera for the price!My 9 year old loves making videos and this is just perfect for her!!You will not be disappointed with this buy!There is great communication with the seller which is always a breathe of fresh air!

5,I bought this for my grandson. He is 4. He loves making videos on my phone and I am sure he will love this. It is better quality than I thought it would be. It is very well made. we believe he is going to be a movie director. He tells us where to stand what to say and he loves this camera.
5,Since I didn't have a photographer for my wife's 40th birthday party I decided to purchase a small camcorder to video moments of the event instead. On a budget I decided to purchase this camcorder. I was very skeptical because of the price but the quality of this item will amaze you! Now my wife and daughters are going to use it for video blogs.
5,I teach a course and was looking for a cheap way of recording myself giving the lecture. This perfectly fit the bill. I use the FHD quality which is at 15fps instead of HD at 30fps. The camera's mic was surprisingly able to capture my speech as well.
5,The product is great!! I bought it for my wife who has made a hobby out of making make up tutorials. She loves the camera definitely would start off with this camera if your just now getting into making shoots.
5,I just needed this camera for a small project documenting a trip with friends. It was the perfect tool - great battery life and simple to use. Also has this fun retro vibe to it that makes it great to have around hanging with friends. For the price and what I needed you can't beat this camera!
5,The size of this camcorder is perfect for travel if you are a free lancer. It comes in convenient travel case and includes extra battery pack as well. If you are interested in getting started in vlogging this is the camcorder for you.
3,Zoom button didn’t work
1,I was excited to get this little video camera but upon using it I boxed it back up and returned it. The audio is horrible. All you can hear on playback is muffled sounds. The fill light works great if your within 10 inches of the subject.
5,I love this item!It is perfect for making videos. It was a gift for my 8 year old and he loves it. Very easy to use great picture quality for the price and inexpensive. Would definitely purchase again.
5,Like the features. Its slick. It works pretty well. I recommend! Great image quality. The camera feels great in your hand.  Its lightweight ease to use sturdy and compact!
5,Speedy delivery. I thought this product would be cincy but it seems very nice! I can't wait for my daughter to open it on Christmas morning!!
5,I was blown out by the features and video quality of this little camera at this price! I was not expecting this level of ease of use and image stabilization! You will not regret buying this camera.
5,This camcorder is great! The size is perfect and compact. The video quality is great it's clear. I bought this for my son to make youtube videos and so far it is working well for that. He's 8 and was able to figure out and use the camcorder well.
5,I liked how easy it was to set up. The manual was easy to read and I was able to locate the download on the internet for free fairly easily. Cute camera at a reasonable price.
5,Very nice product awesome price as well. Totally recommend for everyone looking for a video camera. 10/10
5,I record my daughter's softball games from behind home plate.  The video that we get is awesome and is very clear.  It is the same level of quality that we received with the more expensive cameras.
3,la verdad no es lo q yo esperaba
5,I love love the camera! My husband and I bought this camera for our daughter who is 9 and a You tuber.  It works so well with editing and the zoom . If your a beginner I would suggest this for you or a responsible kid like ours!

5,I use this camera for my training videos. It has an amazing output compared with other camera I had. The pictures are clear and serves my need for uploading my products for online marketing. It worths more than the price.
5,Very functional and cute fun product for amateur videographers. An inexpensive way to let your children engage in their newly acquired video making fad. Worth the money. Highly recommend. Not for professional use but more than fine for children.
5,Great Lil camcorder for a great price. Got this to use for my daughter’s wedding. It was perfect! Very happy with it.  Easy to use battery life is great. It comes with 2 batteries which is a life saver when you are doing a lot of recording. I would definitely recommend this camera.
5,Got this for my granddaughter and she really likes it. We got it up and running in no time. Well she did. I was reading the directions and she had figured most of it out already. Just had to figure out how to watch the video but that was quickly resolved. It’s compact lightweight and she likes using it rather than her phone.
5,This video camera works great! The picture quality is of high quality and it's so easy to use. The portable size is perfect to bring anywhere and comes with a carrying case.  I would reccomend this to anyone looking for a video camera of great quality while still being affordable.
5,This is a nice camcorder. It took me for while to understand this camcorder.The first I was little frustrated but now I enjoy using it since I can uderstand how it works.Some review mentioned it is cheaply made I think it is very good for the price.I didn't rate for Battery life since I don't know yet.
5,I love how compact it is and it looks cute too.!!!
3,Focus and picture quality very poor.
5,I bought this camera for my grandson. The instructions were easy to read and the functions were easily accessible.He loves this camera and fancies himself a Youtube video artist. We couldn't be happier with this purchase. It was everything we hoped it would be.
5,This is very good camcorder that will get the job done without breaking the bank. Very easy to operate and decent quality of image. I recommend this if you need a camcorder for everyday use!!
5,This is my first camera it's nice and comes at a great price. It's not so HD but I'm all right with that. It's also a nice size so you can take it anywhere.
5,I really like this video camera. At first I thought for the price of it its not going to be good. But man I was totally wrong. The video camera recorded really well and the picture stabilization was great.  I love how it has 2 batteries so it never runs out :) I will definitely let my friends know!
5,Needed a camcorder to see progress of home renovations. To set up was a breeze and it’s very simple in functionality.
5,My 11 year old loves this Camcorder. He wanted it for Christmas to record videos. But decided to give it to him a little early. I'm impressed what he has recorded using his toys. It's easy for him to hold. Its best to use this for a video project. Simple to use
1,Update: I just received an email not through Amazon offering to give me a $50 gift card to change or delete my review.  It was a pretty sappy story about small companies in these hard times.  I almost believed it but it was “from Hope Allen” and signed “Leslie”.There is something fishy here not sure what but you should probably stay away.Original review:  It’s okay depending on what you want to use it for.  For $69 there isn’t much room to complain but the zoom switch was broken when it came.I use it as a nicer webcam and not having the zoom function is not a big deal for me.It isn’t bad but keep your expectations low like the price.
5,Simple to use. Picture and video quality was as good as I expected.
5,My son bought it with his garage sale money. He loves it so far!
5,This camera is exactly what I was hoping to get. It gives your videos that home-video look for a great price.
5,My 11 year old love this product! It’s easy to use and great quality!
5,I purchased this camera as well as a separate stand for college assignments as well as personal use.  It works really well and is especially easy to get the hang of.  I would recommend buying a separate microphone or a microphone attachment for ease of use.  Customer service is great and very helpful!
5,The product is very comfortable.It has all that I wished for:- Good resolution.- A lot of features.- A nice case for the camera.- well adjusted to your hand.It's not a professional video camera but for a hobby or as a present it's more than enough :)
5,Love the camera and camcorder works really well.
5,The camera is very easy to set up with the battery and the SD card.  Also it is lightweight and durable enough to use when walking. Nice design as well. Nice pictures as well!
5,I purchased this camcorder for my trip it has good picture quality it's easy to use and it looks great.
5,The picture quality is good for low budget device like this one but the main plus goes to picture stabilization. Digital zoom is supported too.Battery life is pretty good but the seller goes extra mile putting additional battery in the box.You can also take decent photos and all in one this is far away the best camera for the money.
5,I like how easy it was to use. Good quality
5,we just received this product and was asked to review it in exchange for a benefit. It is fairly simple basic camcorder. Our purpose is to use it to capture another angle for blogging so we aren't requiring a lot of bells and whistles. For that this is a great price.
5,The camcorder was a little smaller than expected but it works great I love this device
5,Bought this for my step-daughter’s 10th birthday.  She absolutely loves how small and easy to use it is!  Great purchase!
1,It says it is 1080 p video and image quality but it is Not! The image and video quality is the same and it has a blueish tint all the time no matter how I tried to fix it. The audio quality is garbage! It sounds as if you are far away from the mic and mumbled. While recording and videoing and zooming you can hear it and if you are talking while zooming then you can not hear anything you said. If anything and your child asks for a camera or something of the sorts that’s the only way I would buy this but not for the price. Honestly the price is to high in my opinion for a camera like this. It’s false advertising to say it’s 1080p when it’s not! They did however accept my return and refunded my purchase very quickly. But don’t waste your money it isn’t worth it. And what gets me is that they have this catagorized as a “YouTube” starter camera.
5,It very compact and good quality for the price.
5,We wanted a camera with high definition that is also compact and easy to use. This one was just what we were looking for. I was pleasantly surprised that it came with two rechargeable batteries as well. We're happy with our purchase and loving the camera so far.
5,Great product for the price! Comes with two batteries which is great. All you need to add to make it work is an SD card which most people have already.
5,This video camcorder is a great value. The initial set up was easy and instructions very clear. The picture quality is very good and the downloads of the video very easy. We are definitely happy with this camcorder and recommend it for your video or photo recording.
5,We used it for Christmas loved the camera. I like that it’s small easy to hold. My grandchildren used it actually. I have to have some time now after holidays to sit down and read instructions ect. So far seems to be a great product. Thank you very much.
5,I loved the picture quality it is helping me very much with my Instagram promotions ..!!!!!

5,I recently purchased this camcorder and it's pretty good it is a 1080 p camera but it's still a good camera for your buck. This camera is light conferrable and easy to use just remember to always white balance the lense before you record anything this will make It better in order to capture the true colors. Definitely a must.
5,There are many camcorders and I got this one for my 12 year old daughter bday. All she wanted was a camcorder and after looking thru countless amounts of camcorders this was best choice. Very simple to use and quality is outstanding.  We couldnt be happier. with it.

5,This is a pretty cool little camera. It does well with photo quality and video quality for the price. There really isn't any space on the actualy camera to take a test photo or video so you will need an SD card before you can check it out.Overall this little camera does well and is a convenient size.

5,Bought for my mother & it’s easy for her to use. The 1080p picture quality is great. Would definitely recommend and purchase again.
5,Not what I expected. Based on reviews I thought this camera would be better. You get what you pay for. No autofocus with movement makes image look cheap.***Update***I changed my review because I was contacted by customer service. They were concerned about my unhappiness with the product. Together we worked to resolve the issue. They were very courteous.
5,This is a great video recorder. It’s easy to use and captures all your intentioned memories or trick shots or fun excursions with dignity. We enjoy it and recommend it!!!

5,My son ordered this camera to start making videos for his YouTube channel. Great starter camera that he can easily take use and take care of.Very good purchase!
3,Worked well. Battery does NOT last long.

5,This is the 2nd camera we bought. We loved the first so much but it was for our son. We have a 1 year old now and wanted one to catch all his memories. The quality is amazing and it's easy to use.
5,This product is perfect for my use. I am using it to document me and my wife’s everyday lives. It’s perfect for its compact size and quality. Great product for casual video and pictures
5,Great first camcorder. Wanted to get it to record my summer adventures and it’s perfect!
5,I like this little camera. It's lightweight and good for one-handed use which is perfect for me to video my artwork. The videos come out good for putting up on YouTube. Its not for a professional but for someone who wants a lightweight camcorder-style camera it's perfect. For a camera that does 1080p video the price is right.
5,I got this for my 10 year old. It is amazing he loves it
5,I bought this product for my child as a gift I will say that it’s perfect for that purpose! If you’re expecting 500 dollar camera for 65 bucks you’re going to be disappointed but everything about this is perfect for my son! I will definitely be doing business with them again
5,Very good camera excellent sound and picture quality for something that was only about $60.
5,This is just what I wanted something small to capture family moments. It was easy to set up and get started.
2,My iPhone takes better video and sound than this camera. The video quality is okay but the sound is terrible. There is no AUX input to use an external mic so there is no hope of improving that with equipment I already have on hand. The user interface isn't very intuitive either. I was having issues with it starting to record and cutting off thirty seconds later. I decided to return it after attempting only one video.
5,I love this camera! Found it reasonably priced and the picture quality is good. I was worried it would be grainy when I hooked it up to my laptop or tv but not at all!
5,While it doesn't have most (any) of the features of the big name brands it does take videos that you can edit and watch.  It's very small and compact and has a sleek modern look to it.  Don't expect cinema quality movie magic but if you're just getting into videography - you can't go wrong here.
1,Falls apart after 1 month I would avoid tnis when I first got this one of the screws feel off that’s right yes I’m going to tell you more problems I had with it I went to insert a battery when my Amazon return policy closed the battery wouldn’t stay in this item do not recommend this whatsoever. So I threw out this item back in January 2021i didn’t think they where able to do anything pass the policy date.  I called Amazon to discuss about this item I talked to a nice gentleman at Amazon customer service I told him my situation what happend with this item he refunded me.
5,It is a amazing camcorder holds a good charge plus get a extra battery thank y’all so much for this amazing product
5,Great product!! Got to record kids sporting events and it has been great !! Light weight and easy to use !! It works perfectly for what we wanted it for !!!
5,The camera is an excellent low cost option. I'm sure the more expensive cameras work better for many functions. I used this as a webcam for streaming and it works well. I will likely continue to use my phone for video.
5,What a beautiful little camera! Perfect starter camera and great size for small hands. I bought this for my son.
5,This is a wonderful little camcorder! It is small enough to easily take with you anywhere and still gives you quality videos. It is perfect for capturing memories anywhere anytime.

5,I got this camera to video my summer and have memories on film. It’s quality and a bit blurry but for the price it’s amazing so glad I got it! Can’t wait to use it more!!
5,This is my first video camera and I found it easy to use.  I followed the instruction manual and everything works as described no problems.  Excellent high quality video and audio.  I assume that more expensive cameras have additional features but as a beginner I find this camera to be great for the price.
5,This video camera is everything my daughter needed to do her YouTube videos and pranks. It’s just enough and not too much not too complicated. She loves it. I’m happy that she’s happy.

5,We bought this as a Christmas present for our grandson and he loves it. Lots of functionality at a great price!
5,Set this up the first day I received it and I am very happy with the ease of operation and the quality of the digital videos. Your are not going to film a commercial product with this but it will do for vacation short subjects and documenting home projects.
5,This Camera does very well to fulfil the needs that I currently have. The image quality is very clear and the video capabilities of this camera were far better than I expected. The stabilization is not the best but is miniscule in comparison to the overall functionality of the camera itself. All in all a great buy.

5,Brought it as a gift for my niece to do vlogging videos and she loves it

5,The camcorder is a decent video camera to record kid's activities. It is not a  camera with $1K price tag. The quality is good for its price.  If you want to buy something to video tape family daily activities this thing will do the job!!!
5,Good quality for the price. Bought specifically because it can record while charging. I'm using it to film a birth so having it be able to record during charge is a plus.
5,I like this compact camera that was affordable and useful. It should fit my needs nicely in the future. It seems well made and functions properly. The seller ships fast and it was undamaged. The batteries seemed to even come fully charged which is cool.Thanks for the camera!
5,Really like the ease of using this and option to take pictures or video.  Zoom works great and there's tons of options for transferring data.  Great price and quality!
5,The camcorder video quality is exceptionally good. Would need some extra lighting in more dimlit places. The audio quality could be a bit better but in personally record audio and video separately so this doesn't really affect me. It's light weight easy to carry around. And most of all it's very affordable. Satisfied with this purchase.
5,Easy to use bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she still loves it!  She is 9 and she has no problems operating this device nor does my 7yr old.  Very fun for them!
5,Great camcorder for first timers and especially tweens or teens. Easy to use and does the job. Expect lots of on screen time parents if your kid loves to film everything. You might be the star in their recordings while they get the hang of it. I would recommend this product.
5,We purchased this product primarily for our family use and so our child could easily operate a handheld digital video camera. The camera is fun and easy to use. The features are simple and easy to understand.
5,This is an amateur camera. Great for someone who is just beginning to make videos and wants to try it out. For itprice point it does a great job. However if you are an experienced videographer or looking for a hi-tech option this one may not be the one for you.
5,After a week or two of regular use I can say that this camera does exactly what was advertised. It is not going to produce oscar level films but it certainly does an excellent job of capturing day to day activities onto my SD Card. I like that the screen flips around to a front view.
5,I love the camera it’s so cute and just in time for Easter pictures
5,This is perfect for Youtubers who want to start their passions. Note that this camera does not come with an SD card and you won't be able to take video's until you get one. Good Camera!

5,Bought this as a birthday gift for a 9 year old.  He figured out all the features instantly and loves it. It a great size for smaller hands and super easy to use.

5,Camera is exactly what we were expecting. My son absolutely loves it. Camera is sturdy and well made.
1,Honestly I thought it was a nice little camera at first. But then little pieces started to fall off or malfunction. A small piece next to the battery fell off first. So the battery would slip out every now and again. Then the little door that keeps the SD card started to malfunction and wouldn’t stay in place. No I never dropped it! I tried watching a video I made with it and the sound was almost nonexistent. I bought two different microphones to attach to it. However there was nowhere on the camera to actually connect the mic. I finally decided to contact Amazon to see if I could exchange it or something. But the only thing that could be done because if the seller options was a return and full refund.
5,I purchased this camcorder for my 8-year old daughter. She is always using my phone to make videos so I wanted to her to use this instead. It is very easy to use and my daughter picked it right up. Great beginner camcorder for casual use.

1,I really tried with this camera. We wanted it to record our church services to be uploaded to our Facebook page. I recorded our service is segments and some of the segments were corrupt and I couldn't use. I also had difficulty finding it on my computer when it was uploaded. Some of that problem I admit could be my lack of knowledge. I just need something easier that will record in one segment for 1-2 hours. That's my main issue. I can learn the other stuff. PS. I purchased a 64 GB SanDisk card to use in this camera. Now that I have returned it I tried the card in another camera and it won't work. Apparently it has been ruined/corrupted.

5,I ordered this camera for my first "big girl" trip to Colorado. Its cheap(er) so i knew what to expect. However I didn't expect the picture quality to be so clear and light full! I don't recommend relying on the camera to hear videos well. Its very light feels almost plastic. Super sporty perfect!

5,Great camera - does exactly what I need - wish it had a lense cap but the soft case it come with is sufficient. Excellent.
5,Great product!! Does what it’s supposed to and easy to use
1,I've had this camera for over a year but only used it about 2 times briefly. When I went to go charge it up (with the appropriate cable) to use it came on fine - so I turned it off and let it charge. Now no matter what I do it will not turn on. Whether it has either battery in or no battery plugged in w/ or w/o battery in place etc. It's completely a brick now for no reason. DO NOT BUY.

5,Let's place ourselves in reality. Why do you expect pro quality results from a camcorder that costs $ 64? . The camera is pretty good for its price.

5,I got this for my son because he is wanting to do videos and he could not be happier with this camcorder. It's easy for him to figure out easy to use and great quality. Highly recommend!
1,No instructions. Sound quality is horrible. There is a buzzing noise all the way through the audio. Picture quality is sub-par at best. I bought this for my 9-year old grandchild who is interested in making movies. I should have known that this was going to not be a good purchase when there really isn't a brand name on this and getting instructions on how to use is a joke. Don't waste your money. Oh and by the time we got around to actually video-recording something and uploading onto a computer only to realize the buzzing was not going to go away we were ONE DAY past the return date. Not cool.
5,Zoom is awesome easy to use
5,It really nice and worth the cost!
5,i don’t have any dislikes on it
5,For the amount I paid I’m fairly happy with it. It looks very nice and is definitely a good start with making videos. 10/10 would recommend for beginners.

5,super great camera. I love it a lot.
5,The zoom works great as does filming under low light conditions (with the integral light turned on).  The best feature is how intuitive the buttons are positioned - everything is just where it needs to be.  The customer service and support is excellent.
5,I got this for YouTube and personal vloggin.. I LOVE IT!! So far so good.  And the product is very easy to use

1,Received the video camera as a Christmas gift.  I put the battery into the camera which is very challenging todo for a video camera.  Camera was charged up and seemed to work perfectly.  I put a SIM card in to it to format it.  It told me to take the sim card out after formatting it.  I put the card back in.  I attempted to record and all I saw on the screen was a flashing white and green screen.  I ejected the card.  Still trying to eject the battery since the power button will not turn off the camera.  I will be sending this item back immediately after the holidays.  Good thing it broke early and did not have to have the item for a few months and discover this.

2,Maybe a great beginner camcorder for some however I sent this back because of the following reasons: 1.)  Image stabilization was terrible  2.)

5,What a great buy! High quality product and sincere customer service. Comes with 2 batteries and a durable case. I cannot wait to start recording!
1,DO NOT waste your money.  Buy a used real video camera on eBay or Mercari for the same price.This is plastic worse than a kids toy.  The zoom button did not even function. it Is like the button is just for looks.  There was also a card in the box and wanting you to email this company for a coupon to pay for the camera.  Very fishy. Do not buy this.  I’ll be canceling my amazon prime membership and ordering from more reputable suppliers of items from now on.  This was for a Christmas present.  Unfortunately I waited until the night before to get it out and try it.  Planned to give it to my daughter In The morning.
2,I like thats it’s very lightweight however the battery life SUCKS even though it comes with 2 batteries. Took it to my son’s middle school football game to record and within 45 mins into recording it died andI lost ask the video footage. Also the pictures isn’t as clear like in the photos.
3,Very small looks bigger on the picture
5,I got this for my 10 year old. It works well and is very user friendly. She loves recording everything. It is a great price especially for a beginner camcorder.

5,Excellent video camera for the price. Easy to operate.
1,We bought this to record basketball games. The camera doesn't stay charged very long. Even when fully charged it turns off randomly.
2,First - the item listed for $49 and when I went to put it in the cart it went up to $63.  Shady.  Next - the SD card doesn't format and the door on the SD port doesn't close all the way when it is inserted so it's impossible to mount this on a tripod.  The image on the display screen is not great.  We're going to spend a little more money and get a better quality product.
5,Such a wonderful camera! Way better than expected for the price!!! Well worth it! Fits in coat pocket easy to charge awesome picture.
5,great gift for people just starting to film
5,This was perfect for what I needed it for!

1,Fast delivery compact device with storage bag; however that’s where the positive reviews and.

1,What a load of ...... This thing is horrible. What a waist of money and time to even try and set it up. My Canon camera takes way better video and pictures. Fooled me on this junk. 1080p LMAO!!! This is some of the grainiest video I've ever seen especially if its the slightest bit dark. The built in "light" what a joke!! Utter crap. 24mp as if. Horrible just horrible. On the hunt for something else. I will be spending more this time. Should have known. Charger plug in died also. But I can charge from the USB on my comp.

5,YouTube video zoom is amazing
5,This camera is very handy and lightweight.  Easy handling. I love the less complex functions and easiness to use.
2,I'm decently pleased with the quality of the camera but I'm not pleased with the lack of instructions in the user's manual explaining how to connect the camera to YouTube and upload videos. It's suppose to be a YouTube vlogging camera but doesn't explain what that means exactly or how to use it for YouTube
5,This camera is amazing.  The picture is great.  I just wish I had gotten my camera years ago.  Try it you will love it.  I use mine everyday.  It is really fun.
5,I thought for the pricing I'd get ripped for my money but this is a really good camera for vlogging and amateur footage. It's also really easy to use which helps if you're a beginner

5,Camera works great. Sits an a stand very well not heavy and very easy to use.
5,The only problem I have is with the  hand strap. It's really flimsy and doesn't seem very durable. It doesn't tighten up for smaller hands. Other than that the picture quality is great.

5,Great video
5,This camera camcorder is so easy to use. Instructions are very helpful as well. Now incan easily capture family memories as well as fun moments with my animals.
1,The product first arrived with one battery when the picture showed two I couldn’t rate this because the option never came up for me to do so nor was I able to find this section to write a comment. Also the charger wasn’t working….. I basically threw away money and NOW the giving a review option comes up for this product Waaaaay after the fact 🤦🏾‍♂️👎🏾
5,It's really good and handy. It's very light so it's not to hard to carry
5,Great little camera for the price. I Love it. Very good feel in hand. Very crisp picture quality. Good for youtubing or home videos.
5,I bought it initially for my daughter. Very easy to set up and use. We love it!
5,Amazing
5,Two batteries picture quality
5,On the flip side is a good like camera all around nice small and lightweight.If your recording video or taking photos that not at a far distance the this device is the right choice.
1,Had this thing for about 10 minutes. Read the manual carefully and followed all the instructions. The second I pressed the record or photo button it immediately showed this static glitch image or a completely green screen. I am so upset because I really wanted to start recording immediately but was just so disappointed with this camera. I ordered a replacement because of other positive reviews will update my review with the new replacement camera.
5,Good customer service.
5,This cam corder was just what I wanted ! My daughter loves to YouTube so I she has been asking me for one and I found this inexpensive gem! Uploading to computer is a snap!
5,A wonder small camcorder the sound and video is great the picture is clear but not the greatest quality. But overall great product!
5,Cute camcorder. Perfect for kids.
5,I like the ease of use.
5,Great camera for beginner to experienced bloggers!!  Very affordable yet quality camcorder.
5,I got this camcorder for my daughter's 12th birthday and she absolutely loves it! She uses it every single day.
5,My niece loves this! She is not allowed to have a cell phone yet. Thrilled she can take videos and fuel her creativity. Compact and lightweight. Excellent product great price.
5,I have enjoyed using it; its size the life of its 2 batteries and the full rotation of its screen makes it very helpful especially for kids trying to enjoy their time out.
5,She absolutely loves it
5,I love that it is light-weight and easy to use.  The quality of the picture is amazing batteries charge up quickly and set-up is even easier.
5,Great video and phone camera. Easy to use and wonderful portability. Very satisfied!

5,Great Camera for the price. It's picture is clear and easy to use! I highly recommend it!
5,Item came as described and worked well once I got an SD card (does not come with item). It's a great inexpensive gadget and all you need for amateur video footage. Would recommend.
3,Returned- does not allow for more that 32gb of memory.
5,Great camera.  Used it to record my daughters soccer games.
5,Nice small camera.  Easy to operate and charge.  Well worth the money
5,Overly satisfied with this camcorder. Highly recommend.  We bought it to film our first child.
5,Awesome for home videos!
5,I really love this camcorder. It works well and it is very durable. It’s one of the best ones I have bought so far and the price is very reasonable.
5,This is definitely a entry level camcorder .No adjusting settings very basic.With that said an ok camcorder for a child wanting to up there interests in photography.
5,I love this productIt is really good quality 🌟🌟🌟
5,Great little camera especially for the price! Perfect for beginners easy to operate and I love that it has two batteries.
5,Does this take a normal SD card. What kind of SD card does this camera take?
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Zoom is damaged . Product box looked intact - not sure what happened
1,So I'm going to give a real honest review so someone doesn't buy this after seeing the star rating and some of the other reviews. Yes the video is pretty good quality. But the audio is horrible! First thought was it was going to work t make home videos of our new daughter so we didn't have to use cellphones in front of her and it was easy to place onto laptop/store. The audio has ruined a few months of precious moments. I'd suggest spending money of a better video camera. I'll probably gift this recorded to a little cousin that will enjoy making fun videos with friends for fun.
5,This camcorder is everything you could ask for in a camcorder. Perfect picture quality and great for long distance shots. Recommended for all!
2,I was super excited to get this camera but sadly had to return it. It did not do well in medium light had major issues capturing red and had an exceeding choppy zoom feature. My webcam was less grainy and more stabilized than this camera. I had no trouble with the return.
5,Sound quality is great didnt have to use my microphone video quality was amazing.
1,This camcorder is the biggest piece of garbage. Buying this camcorder was no different than buying fast food..... what you see on the menu is nothing like what you get in real life. No zooming capabilities it has a button for it but it doesn't do anything. We set it up Christmas morning to record our kids opening their presents and the stupid thing kept pausing the recording so we only got half it on video! Oh and the batteries are crap too!
1,Do not buy this camera! I bought as a Christmas present for my son so that he could do you tube videos and it only worked for 2 days.  The screen went blank after 2 days and we are unable to see anything on the screen.  I contacted Amazon customer service and sent an email to the seller and got no response.  Do not waste your money!
5,Great product! Kids love it!
5,Wonderful camera for the price very versatile for YouTubing with a child. Fun gift and quality to boot!
5,This is definitely a camcorder that is worth the price and would serve as a great tool for beginners to start learning.
5,this is a great little camcorder. it is my first so i don’t have much to compare with but it was easy to use and records great videos.
5,Perfect travel Sikhs very easy to use excellent bonus features. Definately worth the price.
5,This is a very lightweight and easy to use video camera!
5,Totally satisfied. If you’re looking for a top-notch 1080p high-definition camcorder at a reasonable price point this is the one. Just order memory card separately. It’s not included.
5,This camera is nifty and easy to carry around. It will likely serve your needs and has a good bang for the buck at its current price.
5,Got this for my Grand Daughter for her 10th birthday and she loves it.
5,I like this camcorder alot. It is great for a first timer.
5,I like everything about it
5,Perfect size for my daughter!!
5,Surprisingly really good especially for its price.
5,Bought for my 10 year old son who just starting out on vlogging and it is perfect! Easy for him to use!
1,Ok so I tried to like the camera. I set it for Full HD video recording so I could update professional-like videos online. To my disappointment this camera does not perform well either indoor or outdoor. My voice is muffled the picture is always jerky not Full HD at all and I cannot use it for professional videos. Customer service was great getting my refund. All in all it seems to be a toy camera and maybe it's ok for family or trip videos. But I think the camera lens are just terrible as I could not get one clear video during my trial. I sent it back and will look for a better camera elsewhere.
5,Sound quality isn’t great but for a relatively cheap camcorder you get what you pay for.
5,Used the camera for a Church event to transmit vidio to another room. Setup was easy and quaility of picture was goo.  Well worth the money
5,I love this video camera. It is very easy to use and fun to have a dedicated camera to record family events.
5,This camera is super easy to use amazing quality of video and imagery and most of all quite reasonably priced! Highly recommend!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Es muy portatil y tiene muy buena relación calidad - precio.
5,Does everything it says it will do. Easy to use. Inexpensive. What's not to like?
5,Got this as a gift for our Granddaughter. She is thrilled! Lots of memories to be made.
5,Nice light weight camera. Low cost but good value. I would recommend to any family who is looking for their first video recorder.
5,I just started a sports vlog for disc golf and this camera has been great!
5,Loved the cams versatility..easy to carry in my bag and have when i need it and its light enough not to weigh down my bag...
3,I will give it to my 9 year old niece for Christmas - this is like a toy.
5,Very easy to use. Bought this for my son for his 15th birthday. He loves it & is very happy with it.

5,It’s perfect I got it for my daughter she is happy no problems with it at all
5,My son loved it!
5,Very good camcorder. Good picture and sound quality. Extra battery is nice but the camcorder is the charger for them so you have to have them charged in advance.
5,I like the whole camera.
5,My son loves it!
5,I liked the camcorder . It is very good quality. Battery life is good. Easy to put photos and videos from camcorder to PC. Price is very good for this quality.

5,Great so far exactly what my daughter wanted for her videos. Thanks
5,fast and good!!
5,Great camcorder and Easy to use. It’s very light weight and great zoom.? Volume is pretty low but other than that it’s great
5,Loved how mini and portable it is! It literally fits in my purse without taking up space. Also has suprisingly great picture quality for the size! Would recommend to friends
5,My only dislike was that the set up took a while. The camera does what I want. Great product for the price!
5,Purchased this to video our kids sporting events and life moments. It’s worked great in both a gym setting and home.
5,Excellent I brought it for my daughter and she loves it
1,I initially liked this camera but not anymore. First of all I've tried a few memory cards in it and I keep getting an error message. The next thing is I keep the camera stored in the box and yesterday I took it up and there is a thin coloured line at the top of the little screen. It's a nice toy but not worth the money. The seller will also offer you a gift card for a 5 star review.
5,I really enjoy using this camcorder. It is small and compact enough to take traveling with me everywhere and the material is good quality.
5,Awesome for the price. Got this as an early Christmas gift for my daughter. It's easy to use and the picture quality is amazing.
5,This product is affordable has great quality both the zoom and image stabilization are awesome. I love this product
5,Perfect. We bought this for our sons basketball ball games and it works really well. Looks awesome and the price was great.
1,I bought this in 2019 and I decided let my neighbors borrow my Sonyand I would use this for the first timeit will not format three different sd cardsit just freaks outmy advice to you is buy a well known brand.
5,love the Camera the strap is a little loose but i worked around it serves it’s purpose.
5,Easy to use. Good quality video.
5,Great camera for the price! Perfect for taking video memories as our baby grows.
5,A perfect camera for me to start my vlog. Love it so far
5,This is a pretty decent handycam for the price. Functions as expected. Got is as a gift to old granny who uses an old cell phone. She liked it.
5,Perfect starter camcorder for my daughter YouTube videos. SHE LOVES THIS CAMCORDER!!!!!
5,The camera is lightweight good quality video for the cheap price. The volume is a bit low but that can easily be solved by an external mic being attached!
5,Im using this camera for vlogging purposes and it is easy to use while providing quality images. Glad I bought this camera
5,Expected less and got more.
5,Very Compact and easy to use
5,very good quality. easy to useI love it
2,I purchased this hoping that it would be a start for vlogging but I guessed wrong. I am unable to use the footage that I captured because my laptop is not compatible. I wish I could return this and get a refund back.
5,great camera for the price
5,I buy this product for my niece as a gift. Is a good camera for the price. The quality and the functions are good.
5,Good starter camera for vlogging!
5,I got this to have fun and make memories with friends! It is great for that purpose and a wonderful price.
2,You get what you pay for... the quality is terrible. My son’s tablet has better quality. Very distorted and discolored. The strap on the side is so loose you’re better off without it.
1,I had this for a while before i used it. I used it to record video and it would just shut off on its own after a few minutes.. junk.. i formatted a card for it everything it required. Item didn't work like i needed.
2,This could be a great STARTER CAMERA/CAMCORDER but it’s not for someone looking for VERY GOOD QUALITY. The lighting wherever you’re using it needs to be perfect because this camera isn’t the best. Everything looks dark and dull and blurry. I want to return for a refund and wait until my YouTube Channel can pay for a better one. Almost there....
5,Really enjoy the camcorder very easy to learn and use.
2,Am I the only one that thought this camera was terrible.  It didn’t focus. Pictures were terrible. Sound was terrible. I bought because the reviews were promising but I returned it. Felt like a toy (cheap plastic).
5,Love it
5,It's a great quality recorder! :)
5,Loved the quality of pictures and video. Compact and easy to use.
5,This little camcorder is excellent for the price. The battery life is outstanding and the zoom works better than expected.
3,It was ok. The sound wasn’t too good.
5,Great camera for still photos and videos. Easy to use. Very clear. Many options.
5,NA
5,Good product
5,Very compact and high quality video for a price you can't beat
5,I'm in love with my new camera......thank you so much 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍😊😊😊😊😊😊

5,This is a great camcorder for beginners i love how its sp easy to use n has great video n u can take pictures too
5,Great camera and easy to fit into the palm of your hands.
1,The capture device doesn’t recognize indoor lighting. It reminds me of the Razor phone camera of some 12 years ago. At no point of use was this device a better option than my existing phone. I kept it stored in my room during my trip to limit frustration. Thank God for Amazon returns.
5,Lightweight and easy to use.Great video quality
5,I love this for all of my B-role and behind the scenes footage! Also really light and simple to operate.
5,Good for the price
1,These cameras are hot trash the reviews must be fake because (a) the quality was terrible which we expected after reading reviews but these were for our kids so who cares. But (b) once the batteries drained neither unit ever charged again.  We plug the cameras into their charger and nothing. We bought two of them they are both totally dead just bricks. DO NOT BUY these are hot trash and your camera phone is better.
1,I ordered this camera for my 6 yr old's birthday because of all the reviews and it being lightweight and not overly expensive as she develops her photography chops. The camera came with the zoom broken as well as the batteries not working after being charged overnight. I replaced the camera with a new one and it also arrived with the zoom broken. I returned both cameras and have now been waiting for 1 month for my refund. On top of both cameras being broken my experience was horrible. I will never purchase from this company again.
5,Perfectly compact for your hand for capturing those special moments. User friendly. Used it to record my babies christmas moments.
5,I love the camcorder. The features are beyond my expectations for the price I purchased it for.
5,It’s a good starter camera for a first time vlogger. I bought it for my son and he loves it.
5,Fantastic camera!  I purchased to capture my sons first moments and love how easy this camera is to use and carry.
5,Good price with many features. I love it !
5,Perfect size!
5,Just the right size and excellent clarity
5,This is a great camcorder for the price! Arrived in a timely manner without damage.
5,I liked the size of the camera easy to use and operate. The only improvement I would give is the quality can be better but great otherwise.
5,This product so far has been great!
5,I got this camera to help capture moments and help with getting started on YouTube. So far it’s great!
5,It’s very compact and easy enough to use.  Came with an extra battery and a case for the camera itself.  A good deal all around.
5,Love this camera. My daughter got it to start her YouTube channel! She can’t wait
1,Too complicated for me
5,Great product!
5,This camera is so compact and easy to use!!! If you’re looking for a starter video camera LOOK NO FURTHER!
5,For a 60$ camera it's easy to use and a good start if you plan on getting into the idea of films and such.
5,The camera has a good quality microphone. The picture quality is great especially for only $67.
5,Great product for the price!! Bought for my 8 year old and she loves it!! Great quality!

5,Great product for the price. The picture quality is excellent. Handling Is great. Used for family photos birthday party and holidays.
5,Great product for a good price. I’ve been happy with it so far; good quality image and sound.
5,This is an entry level video camera with all standard features. Quality is great and overall I couldn't be happier with my purchase.
5,It is not the best camcorder but considering the price it is not a bad product. Would be a great toy gift for children.
2,Product is not worth the hype. Volume doesn’t sounds good and the zoom does not look good makes the whole image blurry. Overall good for little kids not for adults. Save your money.
1,Out of all the positive reviews this product REALLY let me down. I know you get what you pay for but honestly the image quality on this was so low I wouldn’t have paid 20 bucks for it. I tried it in multiple settings/ lighting areas and the image and the audio never got better. I even went as far as to record a video and try and edit it on my computer to see if that could make it better and it didn’t help one bit. This is the first item in my history of online shopping that I have ever returned
5,Me alegro que llego en tiempo es de muy buena calidad facil de manipularse las recomiendo a todos.
5,This product is amazing especially when it comes to making home films or just stupid video diaries to look back on!
5,We've only used it a few times but so far it seems like a good camera for the price.
2,I would not recommend this video Camera. I would love to return it but I think I waited too long. It's A good Camera for An early Teen. I do not like the picture quality. The volume is way too low. The Battery life is just ok. So I will just give it to My 14 year old and pay more for A better one.
1,It doesn't work the way it should work I don't know what's wrong with it
5,It is a good product
5,Thus is an excellent camcorder fir the money. It is small so it is to carry and simple to operate. Would definitely recommend it.
5,Great little camcorder. Makes great memories with the grandkids.
2,To small for a person with average hands
2,Unable to format memory disk.
5,Works great. My 9 year old really likes it. Just dont buy the 64 GB SD card. Takes smaller GB.
5,Fast shipping - quality product at a reasonable price.  Recommended!
5,Very good product would recommend to anyone!
5,It is an excellent product I bought it to my son he was excited when he had it
5,Battery drains fast. Overall nice product for beginner bloggers.
5,What a great way to get kids into videos!
5,Awesome camera a great buy if you are looking to start a new YouTube channel
5,Awesome Product and happy to have this with me and recommend the same to buy others for this price range.
2,This camera is not worth the money that I paid for it. I have used it 5 times in less than a year and it freezes up during video. If you have to buy this camera get a warranty..
5,Fue un regalo para mi hijo le encanta hacer videos y es muy práctica para el...justo lo que necesitaba
5,Excelente producto
5,Super simple and easy to use for someone who doesn't know a lot about filming. Great for anyone!
5,This camera is absolutely awesome! For the price I got a bit more than I expected. It’s got everything I could ever need in a camcorder!
5,Great camera bought this for my daughter to make videos. Perfect size comes in a case which is a plus especially for beginners!
5,It's small lightweight.  It's real good for beginners.
5,Good quality and price works as advertised.
5,This product is really useful and can r used for YouTube clogging.
5,Okay. Works alright for the price.
5,For it to be a $63 recorder.. i was surprised how well the thing seems to be made.  I was very impressed!
1,We ordered one and tried it out or attempted but nothing worked.  We thought is was a one time thing so returned and had a replacement sent to us.  The second camera worked a little better.  We could zoom and take one picture.  Otherwise nothing worked and our screen would just go to static.  Anytime we tried to turn it off we had to remove the battery.  It looks really nice and packaged well but two cameras in a row to not work that's not a coincidence!  We will purchase from a different company.
5,This is really a great product for its cost. I found it very easy to do initial setup and start using it.
5,I love the clarity and ease of use. It's exactly what I expected.
5,Product was delivered fast and the seller was very nice to work with. Will order again in the future.
5,Bought for my young daughter to document "life" for a YouTube channel... That I will never let her have. But it's good quality for the price.
5,A gift for my daughter she was so happy to get even happier with how it works
5,Very easy to use.
5,This camera is really nice. The picture quality is great as well.
5,Amazing for the price works great for capturing special moments!
5,Bought this camera for my son and he loves it.  Perfect for him to record himself gaming.
5,Only complaint I have is there is no option for  an external microphone. Everything else is great!
5,This product is top notch. Very nice camcorder.
5,So far seems like a great little video camera to start out for my kid’s you tube chanel.
5,Solid Camcorder. It did what I expected of it. Works great! Doesn't come with an SD Card though
5,I got this for my niece for fun and is good comes with 2 batteries great communication with seller and super fast shipping
1,I needed this to record sessions with clients for the clinical portion of my graduate program. It stops recording and starts again randomly leaving HUGE parts of what should have recorded missing. I have missed crucial dialogue I needed to present because of its malfunctioning. It’s a liability from a professional standpoint & I’m hugely disappointed.
3,I wish it had a mic input
5,This product is great and is just what we wanted to start creating home videos! So excited!
5,This camera is awesome it is so light weight you hardly realize you are holding it.
5,Love how small it is.

5,This camcorder was better than I expected for the price. It was enough for what I needed for.
5,It's wonderful and reasonable priced
5,Son school work
5,This is a great camera for a beginner videographer! It has a solid body and comes with two batteries. Great value for the price.
5,I love the Camcorder. Definitely worth the money. It has a crisp display and is very user friendly!
5,Good quality product  for the price.  It works very well than expected. Satisfying with this purchase.
5,For a small package a lot of bang for the buck.Very pleasantly pleased with this camera was not expecting 2 batteries
5,I love this camera! Its great for home movies!
5,Great price! Comes with an extra battery and super simple to use. Would recommend!
1,I can't even begin to describe all the ways that this camera is sub-par. Amazon customer service tried to contact the company to get some customer support but couldn't find any way to do so. There's warning sign #s 12 and 3.
5,I love the size of the camera and quality.Unfortunately when you zoom it shakes.
5,This is perfect for vlogging and taking pictures
5,I really like the Camcorder! It’s everything you need and the quality is good. The handling is also very easy.
5,This camcorder is amazing especially for the price you pay!! Zoom works great all the features are great!!
5,Great starter camera
5,i bought this camera for my grandson and he enjoys the size and ease of operation.
5,This camera is priced great and works perfect for making home videos for our kids to enjoy rewatching memories.
5,Liked everythin about camera no complaints here.
5,We bought this camcorder for my daughter for Christmas. It meets her recording needs and she loves it!
2,I use this for recording students in communication and business courses. The students are less than 20 ft away and the builtin microphone does not pick up their voices (speaking at normal to somewhat louder volumes to project in a classroom). There is no place to attach an external mic. The images are also grainy.
2,El volumen no es bueno
5,Incredible product. Compact and sleek and fits in one hand and easy to use. Bought one for my niece and she loves it.
5,I use this product for family videos. It was a gift from my husband and it’s just why I was wanting
5,The camcorder works great.
5,Awesome camera ..Good quality ..
5,Great camera for the price.
5,Excellent for YouTubing! Great for making little flicks too!! I like this camera!
1,You know the saying...you get what you  pay for. I ordered this camera for my daughter who want to use it to make YouTube videos We didn't really expect for it to be amazing but we certainly hoped that it would work. The screen would turn on and then as soon as you tried to change any settings or start recording it would go fuzzy. Also it has no built in microphone. We were aware of that before ordering however we unable to connect the one we purchased for it. Needless to say we returned it for a refund.
5,Works well and has great audio!
5,This is a great first video camera. Easy to use built in light 2 battery’s & a case.
1,When you try to charge it not sure if it is charging and when it does when you take it off it shows that it’s almost dead and never holds a charge I’ll be fully charged and then you turn it off and turn it back on and it’s basically almost dead
5,Great camera for a beginner.  Easy to use and does what it’s supposed to do.
5,This is a great vlogging camera! Very satisfied with my purchase!
5,Excellent product. I bought it for my Church. Camera is working as it should.
5,Great gift for my 11yr old daughter. Easy to use view be creative.
5,Great for home videos
5,I love this product came in 1 day!!!
5,I love it. It's small and compact and perfect for all the kids events!
1,Initially the $65 price tag & “Amazon Choice” notation got my attention so I bought it. Although the camera is compact & easy to use the sound quality is SO HORRIBLE that the entire device is useless. Even when I’m holding the camera/recording (right next to the speaker) the device BARELY picks up my voice. I thought I was doing something wrong so I took it to Sammy’s Camera.... nope.... it just has the cheapest sound quality imaginable. Please don’t waste your time/money with this camcorder. Learn from my mistake.... spend a little more to get a better product.
5,Wow I am very impressed with the quality of this camera.  Love the cute carrying case it came in as well.
5,I purchase this as a gift and they loved it.
5,Ordered this for my niece and she loves it.

5,I have an event and was has stating because I wasn’t confident of the product but when I tried it out I love it!
2,Trying to edit videos is pure hell. I would literally give this camera a hire rating but I can not find any editing software to properly upload the videos. And am having the biggest issue and i've been  at it for days. So frustrating
5,I bought this to take on vacation. It was easy to use and the picture quality is great.
5,Personal family events.

5,Love the camera! Great quality for a great price!
5,It’s what I needed and I would buy from them again
2,Maybe I didn't do enough research before purchasing this camera but I am pretty disappointed with the picture quality. The picture looks very grainy/unclear and the color also looks off.
5,Product was exactly what we expected  it came earlier than expected and my son loves it!!

5,This product performs well for such a small camera.  Perfect for kids to use.
5,Excellent quality & ships extremely quick.
5,I really love it an HD approached and I really recommend it
1,I understand that you get what you pay for however the zoom button was very loose and did not function properly. Zoom function also froze at times. Bottom line you can buy a better camcorder for twice the price as this one or you can keep buying this one when it stops working.
1,After a bitter fight with the thing involving how to get the SD card in everything looked good to go until I hit record and the screen scrambled and the camera froze unresponsive to even the power button. Had to take the battery out to shut down every time.Most cameras won't allow the SD card to be set in if it is oriented the wrong way. THIS ONE DID and so my first attempt wouldnt let me push-eject it. I had to force it out with pliers.
1,Bought two of these for my kids. The screens on both broke after only a few months making the cameras useless. One of the kids dropped the camera a few times but the other treated it more carefully. Both have the same problem. Disappointing.
1,Purchased the camera for my 10yr old daughter and after 10 months the screen went out. Purchases the 3yr protection plan at the same time and now I am getting zero help zero response on how to use it
5,Quick shipment exactly as described. Very happy :)
5,So far so good. I have had a pleasantly surprising experience with this device. It has certainly exceeded my expectations.
5,was surprised with the product when being so little.
5,Camera is light easy to use and works great
1,Not worth it. When I click power on this camera will continuously say “Welcome” over and over again and will not actually be ready to record anything until I have left it open for about a half hour. We bought this before having a new baby and unfortunately have not been able to get very much use out of it because having to wait a half hour to use it every time we want to doesn’t quite work!
5,Perfect for my husband's YouTube videos.
5,This product is wonderful! Amy helped me with questions on this product. Great company
2,The quality of the video produced seem more like 480p than 720p or 1080p. If you're getting this for the ergnomics and subpar video quality then this isn't a bad choice. If you're getting this expecting video quality equivalent of what you can film on an iPhone or Samsung then you will be extremely disappointed.
5,Perfect quality camcorder!
5,Works great with a very clear picture. Great camera for the price. Would recommend.
5,Really nice camera great value
5,This camera is great and a great price. My husband loved his Christmas gift.
5,Got this vlogging camera  for my niece for Christmas.It looks awesome.And works great!

5,My daughter is very happy with her new camcorder
5,This camera is awesome it’s not too big it’s not too small it’s just right for video blogging.
5,I bought this video camera camcorder and I love it!
5,Purchased for my 10 year old granddaughter. She loved it and it works great!
1,Used this camera twice screen went black on second use. Its not a battery issue. The camera still powers up and will play the audio. Disappointing
5,Great product so excited for the memories I get to record!
5,Very good video AND audio
5,Awesome product. Used it for camp and it came out beautifully. 5 stars! Highly recommended.
1,Unless I missed the email I have not heard back after my complaint that the audio on this video camera is terrible. Makes entire vide camera not usable. Quality not even suitable for my 10 year old. I’d love to return or get a replacement in case ours happens to just be faulty. Please get back to me
5,This product actually has great quality for the price it sells at. I was very pleasantly surprised! Thank you for this great camcorder!
5,Nice qaulity for its size
5,I like this little camcorder. It’s lightweight but has a rugged feel to it. It does take great pictures and videos.
5,I gifted this to my kid. He liked it very much. It is very compact and easy to handle.
5,Perfect lil camera for videoing our son practice his Disc Golf.
5,satisfying service
5,Excellent camcorder for the price. Comes with two batteries and a case for the camcorder.
1,I couldn't believe how poor the video quality was.  VHS tapes have better quality than this camera.  It is cheap for a reason.  Not worth even the cheap price they sold it for.
5,The Product is wonderful!!!!
5,Works great and inexpensive
5,Great Product woohoo
5,Good camera. Very simple handy and affordable for amateur use.
5,I love it. Every dollar was worth it.
5,Great camera for the price.
5,The video camera camcorder is a great value for the money. It's very easy to use.
5,Works great just what I wanted.
5,the product very light easy hold on hand picture is very clean aslo have 2 batterys can use longer
1,I haven't bought a video camera in a long time.  I figured like TVs ect you can get a cheaper one that will still perform basic functions at a decent quality.  Not the case with this.  The video is poor quality with clipping and dark areas.  The sound is terrible.  I opened it tried it once and returned.  I transferred the file to my computer and tv to see if it was just the screen on the camera but it is just a bad product.
5,Great little camcorder for a beginner. Purchased as a birthday gift and it was a hit! Recommended!
5,Great camera for it's price!
5,The product works with ease!  We bought it for our teenage son.  He really likes it!
5,I plan to use it for my Videos.
5,Great camera that I’ve been using for sports and athlete interviews.
2,Not worth the money I paid for this. I ended up using my cellphone: The quality of the pics was much better.
5,This camcorder is the perfect size for my son. I was very impressed with the image.
5,My 8 year old daughter loves her new camera.  Easy for her to use!!
5,Compact great quality easy to use and the price is right!
1,This is absolutely terrible. Picks up zero sound (maybe my mic was defective?) and the instructions that come with it are awful. Tried to record a video - no sound. Bought a lapel mic - discovered this camcorder doesn't support external microphones. A complete waste of money and a piece of garbage. I'm so upset that I bought this.
2,The camera works good but the picture/video quality is horrible for starting a YouTube channel I'd advise you to buy a cannon t6i camera instead.
5,Light and compact to take to sporting events.Nice that it includes 2 batteries
5,Amazing great camera. Defently was beyond our expectations. A must buy
1,This arrived broken. Would love a replacement to see if it actually works!
5,Very nice camcorder-east and super lightweight. Love that it came with 2 batteries. It’s also very user friendly.
5,Great gift. Son uses it everyday and has had no problems with it.
5,Changing rating due to fantastic customer service with outstanding communication.  Camera is also a nice and handy product.  Thanks!
5,Great camcorder reasonably priced.  Extra battery light weight and easy to use.
5,Nice camera for the money! Note that you will need to buy an SD card for storage.
1,I bought one. I used it once for 3 minutes. try to start it a month laterI never could turn it on again. I bought another one the second one never turned on. So at least I returned the second one but I am screwed with the first one because the return time was gone already.DO NOT BUY!!! This cheap brands DO NOT WORK. Buy a name brand instead.
5,The camcorder is exactly what I was looking for.
5,Camera works great! The little girl that I bought it for loves making "Lol Surprise Doll" videos!
2,I fell for it. I thought this would be at least pretty good for recording basic classes. The picture at highest resolution is grainy and flat. The audio is horrible- tinny and quiet even when I was 4 feet from camera using a louder speaking voice. Definitely not what I needed.
5,Exactly what I was looking for. Thank you!!!
5,👍
5,Great quality and worth the price!
5,For the price couldnt be happier. This is a gift and its perfect. Extra batteries and cables.
5,I’m happy with it. Inexpensive and does everything I want it to do. Picture quality is nice. Battery life too.
5,For the price it’s a good camcorder. Button layout is good. I use it to film on my ebike
5,GREAT PRODUCT  !!!!
5,I like that it is easy to use.  Great quality.
5,It does a good job. Don't underestimate it basing on price and size. Very useful one.
1,the video is crap on this also the video button broke after a few months of having it now I have a glorified paper weight trust me if I could give this zero stars I would it doesn't even deserve one star. Do not BUY unless you want to replace it almost immediately after buying it. COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME!!!!!!
5,Great lower end camera. My daughter loves it.
5,I lived The cameras light the visuals were great In was just great in all all honesty

5,AMAZING camera for the price! You cant find a better deal anywhere else! Highly recommend to anyone!
5,Nice camera for beginners.
5,It works nicely
2,I returned this guy. The quality wasn’t great for what I needed. Outdoor quality was okay but anything done indoor with artificial or low light looked horrible. Looked up some YouTube reviews after I bought it. Should have done that first.
5,Great camera for a beginner!!!
5,So far it’s great! My husband is very happy with it for it purpose.
5,Very nice product for beginners who want to dive into Vlogging and capturing day to day moments.
1,This is one of the purchases that will make you seriously doubt what prerequisite is required of the “Amazon’s Choice” label.This camera is cheap complicated to use and the location and construction of the mini USB attachment (very important) is located in a comprimised area where it can be damaged.
2,Not great
5,Fun and easy to use!
5,What a great video camera at a fantastic prize! Superb buy very happy.
1,I received this camera very quick in the mail and when I opened it everything worked fine or at least I thought it did when I Was ready to start filming I open the camera and the screen just completely quits. Definitely would not recommend this to anyone
5,Bought this for Grand daughter for Christmas. She absolutely loves it.
5,For the money you can’t beat this camera.  Easy to use.  The video playback looks great.
5,Great picture easy to operate and small enough to handle while doing other task! Great product!
5,Love this for my daughter. She likes to sit and video herself.
5,Nice product
5,Very simple camcorder to use. nothing is complicated. not a bad camera to start using first before upgrading to bigger cameras
5,Great camera for a good price. No complaints
5,It is agreat little camcorder it is easy to take anywhere .pic quality is great
5,I LIKE THE FACT THAT CAN HOLD IN ONE HAND AND STILL CONTROL THE CAMCORDER FUNCTIONS!
5,I like the size of the camera small enough to fit in the palm of your hand!
5,Lightweight but durable. Easy for our son to operate. Would definitely purchase again.
1,Bought this piece of junk and when I turned it on FOR THE FIRST TIME it had a screen like you see on a TV when you don’t have a signal (that fuzzy black and white screen). Couldn’t turn it off. Nothing. DO NOT BUY. I had read the bad reviews but thought that since there were so many good reviews it would be fine. I was wrong. I repeat DO NOT BUY. Crappy everything.
2,It’s ok if you don’t Zoom talk or record any kind of sound.
5,The quality of this camera is very good and it’s very easy to use.
5,Great product! Very satisfied especially for the price  and such a speedy delivery.
5,Works great and easy to use.
5,Just what we were looking for to .on vacation
1,I guess it’s true you get what you pay for. I took the cheap way out to make this a third camera to keep in my car. Amazon called it a “Choice.” They are usually correct but not this time. I held it in my hand for fifteen minutes and new I had made a bad choice. I returned it the next day. Spend a little more money and get maybe a small Panasonic.
5,I love this camcorder! My live videos are remarkable! - CWiggins
5,I used the camera to film my horse show.
5,Just like the picture shown
5,Great Priced and good quality.
5,The price is wonderful and you get a good recording quality. Light weight too.
1,The camcoder is ok... but there are no drivers and it won't "install drivers automatically"I have to take apart the mount take out the SDCARD remove the microSD card insert it into the USB/microSD card adapter and then get my files there is no such thing as - plug it in and it will work automatically especially with Windows it works sometimes so you gotta have at least some drivers with your camera!
5,Bought this for my wife on Christmas! Perfect camera for documenting our lives!
5,Great product it was a gift to my friend she’s starting a YouTube channel soon.
1,Like a kids toy. Returned never credited
5,As advertised and easy to use
5,Exactly what I wanted. Inexpensive and still a quality camera. Awesome but.
5,Great camcorder for the price
5,This is a very nice stater camera good quality and easy to use.
5,Great camera. Nice 1080p
5,Bought this for my daughter! She loves it. Great product thus far!
1,I bought this camera to use for my son's up coming AAU season. The camera worked fine and the batteries came fully charged but unfortunately that's all of the use I got out of it because once the batteries died nothing works to be able to recharge them cable USB cable and connector are useless. I went and got another cable but the camera won't charge the batteries $70 out the window.
5,Love it so much
5,My grandson's Christmas gift.  He has been wanting one for a while.
5,Got this product for my daughter and she is loving it
5,Very good quality and easy to use functions. Would definitely recommend.
2,I bought this to serve as a webcam on a tripod.  The picture has bad color and would require a tremendous amount of light to be usable.
5,Great little starter cam for the price. Two batteries is a bonus!!
5,Really great product my kids have been loving it. Very impressed given the low price. Thanks!
5,Great Camera! Delivers on everything it claims to be!
5,Amazing
5,I love how lightweight it is and a start up learning device it is for upbringing talents.

5,Its light weight
5,Good quality for the price
5,User friendly!
5,YouTubing
2,Any phone will take better quality video.  This is like a child's toy.We were not able to use any of the material we filmed with it.
2,This was what I wouldn't describe as the "dollar store version" of a camera.Very cheap material. Terrible quality of image and sound.Returned.
5,Perfect just what my daughter wanted. She loves her new camera.
5,Gave it to me husband for Christmas. He likes it.
3,comes without instructions
5,It’s okay
5,Great camera! Easy to use and very affordable.

5,The zoom feature could of been better
5,Great for beginners good quality my wife and son love it.
5,Do you see the feature on top to mount a microphone? There’s no input for sound.
5,Great camcorder! No complaints.
5,This product is absolutely amazing  I really love this product I really recommend ❤️.
5,This is a great little video camera. Very easy to use and a good value!
1,This camera isn’t to bad. I think the price is a little bit to much for the quality of this camera. And when I took it out of the box and set it all up the mic button broke on it so now I am not able to use that button for my mic. And when you have the wide lens on the big lens cover doesn’t cover so be very careful with it.
1,If you own a phone newer than a iPhone 6.This product is going to be a joke to you. I feel like I went back in time to a Nokia device when operating this. The audio is terrible. The only thing good about this is how it looks. If you budget shopping and not really big on audio quality you will be alright.
5,This camera is easy to use and super light weight. It comes with an extra battery
5,I liked the small size and that it came with a case.
1,I was sad to see that the picture quality is horrible especially when you zoom in I was not even able to distinguish my sons number during his football game I would not recommend this video camera to anybody and would like a full refund.
5,The video quality is excellent. Everything looks amazing in the video.
5,Great beginners product I gave to my niece as a gift
5,Great camera for a good price
2,This product didn’t work when I tested it. It was glitchy and not something I would recommend purchasing. I ended up sending it back after a day of use. Do not buy this product!
5,So far I am satisfied with the camera
1,I was excited when the package came and even more excited upon opening it because it was so neatly packed. But once I charged it and started using it I was disappointed. The camera is cheap plastic that feels like it will break any minute. I messed with it for hours but was never able to even record or take a picture because the screen turned green/fuzzy whenever I hit the record button. Luckily
5,This is a great camera for the price..
5,I liked it for my grandson's video .and loved it for the group videos!
5,Great camera for the price.  Easy to charge and use and comes with an extra battery.
5,Great Video camera
5,Picture Perfect The Sound Is AMAZING ...
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Reviews were great which is why I bought this over the more expensive ones but my box was damaged when I first opened it camera itself looks great but the video is no where as great as I thought 1080p would be audio is terrible in the video I posted my phones not making the video look like that that’s actually how it looks! Very disappointed.
5,Its a good product with good picture quality
1,It is not HD at all. Picture quality is terrible considering the age we live in. Sound quality is worse. Holding the camera and talking it barely picked up the audio. I got this for home videos my phone does a better job.I have never returned anything from amazon till now nor left a bad review.Seriously save your money and dont buy it.
5,I got this for my son's birthday and he absolutely loves it
5,Our daughter loves it! Great product and great value!
5,Considering the low price I paid this camera works well.
5,Liked the price. Zoom quality seems to be good. Purchased to video football games.

5,My 9 year old loves this
5,Comes with a carrying case charger and TWO base batteries. Sleek design controls well.
1,I would give this recorder zero stars if I could.  I bought it for a class that I needed to take video for and it doesn’t stay on and record.  I have troubleshot changed SD cards plugged it in while trying to do the video .. to no avail.  I had to drop another couple of hundred dollars for a new camera.  Please don’t waste your money
2,The quality was poor
5,It’s cool for the price . The sound is great. I can’t complain.. it’s pretty cool.
5,Looking to see how it works
5,Perfect first camcorder for kids
5,It does the job.
5,nice size and quality
5,Great product especially for the very reasonable price.
5,Bought this for my granddaughter and she loves it!!
5,Great gift for the grandson.
5,No frills but very easy to use & decent image quality
2,Based on reviews I though I was getting a decent little camera for a good price. Boy was I wrong! The image does not focus and the sound quality is horrible. Returned right away.
1,We purchased this as a birthday gift. By the time we gave the gift and it was used it had been 20 days from purchase. After 5 uses the screen has gone black. At that point the 30 day return window was up and we cannot return.Very frustrated that such an expensive piece of equipment lasted 20 minutes of use!
5,Very easy to use and makes nice pictures and viodeos.
5,Bought for xmas. Small. Perfect for travel.
5,Great product!  Great price!  Perfect for Vlogging!
2,Not easy to use.  Cables are combursom to use
5,This product is excellent for a kid who wants to start vlogging.
2,Picture quality was not good.
5,I liked this product! Great picture quality!
5,Working great and no issues.. I love it.
5,I really like this camera it has everything that I need.
5,Purchased for my granddaughter she lives it.
5,Great camera at a great price! Would definitely purchase again!!!
5,Its affordable and good
5,Perfect for learning how to make home videos!
5,Absolutely love this video camera
1,The voice and video are way out of sync on you tube. It's like watching an extremely bad foreign dubbed movie. I tried it several times on You Tube and the voice and  mouth movements were way out of  sync. It makes badly dubbed foreign movies look like masterpieces. The only reason I gave it one star is because it came in a box.
5,I liked how easy it was to use.
1,Seems like a nice camera but all the instructions were written by someone whose first language is not English. I do not have the time to struggle with trying to figure out how something works. So; I gave up and will return. I will pay up for a well known brand whose English can be understood.
5,Great gift for my 5 year old!
1,I spent hours comparing this camera to others and after reading the reviews went with it. It sucks. I mean it was 65$ but picture quality was poor had a blue haze and you couldn't hear anything. My son was 4 ft away and I had to strain my hearing to barely make out what he said. I will be trying to return.
5,Loved it!!! Smaller than my iPhone!! Works perfect for the trip I’m taking
5,A gift for my granddaughter
5,Excellent camcorder for that “home video” feel :)
5,Great value! Don’t forget you need to purchase a memory card separately!
5,It's very user-friendly. Great value for the price. Good video and image quality.
1,It came without the charge cable and it isn’t standard. It doesn’t recognize that there’s a memory card unless you’re actively pushing in on the place where you stick it. As soon as you lift your finger it flashes “card error.” Disappointing given the glowing reviews extra disappointing that I planned to take this on vacation tomorrow. 0/10.
1,This is the worst camera ever!!! The picture was so fuzzy and the zoom button didn't work. So horrible!!!Jan 2021... A year later and 2 people from this company has asked me to remove my comment. Just shows you how much false advertising is going on on Amazon. This camera and company are horrible for trying to buy positive reviews.
2,This item was not a favorite of mines. The sound quality is horrible as well as the picture quality. It was very inexpensive but not worth the little money I did spend.
5,This is a very good camera with a great picture for the price.
5,I am very happy with my purchase.
5,Perfect gift for our 8 year old granddaughter!
5,Great camera
5,I haven't used it yet but I'm looking forward to seeing what it can do!
1,Garbage quality not true to it's claim of HD picture at all. White balance makes everything look terribly blue and off while the picture of recordings is jerky and not at all fluid. Not to mention it completely fried out after only five minutes of use! The view finder had a static pattern and the entire thing locked up.Overall a waste of money.
5,Loved the camera overall the price was great and the quality is good
5,Product works great. Image quality good.
5,Good quality product. Especially for the price!
5,Great camera for my needs
1,I bought 3 of these at the same time to shoot multiple angles. I knew the quality would be poor but I assumed the cameras would have basic functionality. The audio and video on the cameras don't stay synced to one another. You play the video and within seconds the voices are out of sync. Waste of money.
5,great buy
2,Kind of cheesy looking. Almost like a kids camera.
5,Jus what I expected..I love my new camcorder
5,Thought zoom would be better but still works okay
1,I just got it today I don’t understand why it has so many good reviews yet I fully charged the camera battery and in less then 20min recording the battery is flashing that is low and the camera keeps turning off. So disappointed the I have to go thru the trouble or packing and returning this crap.
5,No dislikes for sureSolid purchase
1,Only thing I liked about it was the size. Nothing else was to my liking.
5,Works great  great. Pictures. And color. Sound works. Good too. Thank
5,What a great little camera. Light easy to use. Wonderful.
1,I wish I had something good to say about this camera because I was so excited to get it. Here goes: Battery Life is terrible the recording stops in the middle of videos not good picture quality and has problems downloading to my laptop.
5,The size is just right
5,Great product that even comes with a cute little case
5,Compact great resolution definitely worth the money
5,I like the clarity of the camcorder
5,Great camera
5,Daughter loves it for making YouTube videos!
5,The display does not accurately show the quality of the video.
1,I bought this to do a Vlog diary and I'm beyond disappointed I could get how if I would have bought a regular camera how the audio might not be the best but I bought a video camera for that exact reason to have decent audio and it sounds like you're underwater it's terrible I will definitely be returning this video camera
5,Very compact and useful for vlogging!!!!
5,Great product and great company to work with!!
1,Will not recognize sd card regardless of size capacity.
5,Great product my son loves it!!
1,It broke within a month out the blue...it just stop working...the little cam was not coming on even though it was never dropped or mishandled...total cam malfunction 🤷😒😒😒😒
5,Very happy with the video recorder!
5,Battery life seems wonky but over all my daughter loves it
5,Purchased for young granddaughter who is 10. She loves it

5,I'm excited about my new camcorder!

5,Did everything as expected Great price.
5,Camcorder was delivered swiftly and packaged neatly! No complaints.
5,Myself and my daughter both love this camcorder. Thanks.
1,Picture quality poor. Audio quality terrible crackling loud background static. Overall cheap product feels cheap sounds cheap video is cheap. My iPhone does better quality video than this. Don’t waste you money on this piece of garbage. Used it once and can’t even return it because even their return policy is cheap.
1,I was very disappointed with this camara.i bought it to make YouTube videos.it uploads wrong were the video is faster than the audio.also no microphone you can berrly hear anything.and no microphone plug in to enhance it.i want to send it back.waste of money it doesn't do what it's supposed to do.
2,Everything is good for the price but the audio. The playback audio is unusable and there is no input for an external mic.
5,Great customer service. Will definitely recommend to friends and family.
5,Great little camera
5,Light weight and easy to use!
2,Sound quality is abysmal. Feels cheaply made. Will be surprised if it lasts more than a year.
2,I was recording something and the voice quality is not good at all. its better if you can record with a phone. im thinking about returning the camera.
5,Good quality for the price point. Would highly recommend.
5,Easy to use and picture quality is great!
5,I love the picture quality. The zoom feature is incredible. Great video camera

1,Terrible product and they will ask you to give them 5 star review and promise you $60 Amazon gift card.  Which is a lie. Don't fall for it.
5,Excellent.  Love it.
5,Great quality great price
5,This camera is amazing!
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I can’t believe how good the reviews are. The image quality is ‘okay’. When you move around the focus is terrible and images get blurry. When playing back videos the sound is SO muffled. Not clear at all. I am returning and very disappointed.
5,Great video camcorder especially for the price
1,Worse video quality than a children's toy camera 1080p is beyond laughable.  Waste of time and money I sent back the next day.
5,I like this camera is great thanks
5,easy to use small and compact..
2,Worth 25 bucks
2,Bad sound unable to understand it hard to operate buttons not what I expected at all
1,Not user friendly video quality was poor. Went on You Tube and saw the demo even the user was not impressed. I end up buying a Logi HD works much better
5,I works great
2,Video quality is not good. Just use your smartphone.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The video quality wasn't great and I had problems using it as well. As you can see the when I tried to press record the screen malfunctioned. I tried multiple times to fix this and am not sure what to do. Even so there wasn't much support in terms of trying to fix this.
5,To consolidate; pictures photos albums… Travel Memories
1,Purchased for basketball season. Easy to use light weight comes with 2 rechargeable batteries but you get what you pay forEvery cheap.  Recorder kept up with sound but visually seemed to be in slow motion. Save your money.
5,Very happy with the camcorder!
5,Looks great affordable price.
5,It does everything I bought it to do
5,Muy linda
5,Very good product
2,Bad quality in terms of sound and image. Like a toy. Could not believe that many people gave 5 or 4 stars.
1,Camera looks good. But when filming the camera stops working. Film time is less than 3 minutes and the camera stops filming all by its self. POS.
5,Very good value
5,Great product for price!!!
5,Very small which is nice.
5,For the price it's a decent beginner's camera
2,Awful picture quality and horrible battery life. Spend the extra $50 and get a good one from Best buy.
5,Great product
5,Good camera good sellers
5,Item is great
5,great value
1,The camera won’t record and though I was not expecting much given the price it’s much more cheaply made than anticipated which I’d be willing to overlook if it actually worked. But it doesn’t.
1,This is a piece of garbage. Batteries die within an hour of use. Tried to save images on disk abs then they came up unreadable. Completely poor experience.
1,Received the camera in a large box with no packing materials to stabilize it and/or padding inside the camera box itself. I’m sure it took quite a beating. The zoom function didn’t work and overall quality is very poor. I am returning it.
1,no me gusto mucho se que el precio es bueno pero es complejo de manipular y no es compatible con accesorios como micrófonos que compramos y no le quedaron mejor optaré por una marca conocida que me ofrezca calidad y soporte en todo.
5,Good customer service
5,It's a good camera
5,Great for recording memories
5,Excellent customer service by Amy
5,Good quality.
1,The picture quality is very bad.  Indoor video was dark even though the room was well lite.
5,Great
2,The volume was static. We recorded one game then the charger stop working. It was that price for a reason.
5,Awesome!
1,I bought this to just have a handy video camera to record some videos. This is a terrible camera overall - the image quality is bad it's hard to charge and if you get a half decent video the words don't match the lips. Don't buy this camera.
5,Perfect for my application
5,Great product!!
5,Like it
1,This is difficult to use.  It's not user friendly or intuitive.  You definitely need instructions on how to work it and even the instructions were hard to understand.
1,The downside of this purchase the camcorder did not come with a Memory card I was supposed to get credit for that and which until this day I have not gotten credit so I would not recommend buying this product at all it is incomplete on all levels
1,Not a good quality and now I’m stuck with a cam recorder that I couldn’t use for the birth of my daughter!!
1,The microphone does not pick up anything unless you are holding the camera or are next to it. The picture quality is very poor not a true 1080 as stated in the in the description. My phone was better quality then this. DO NOT BUY!
1,I was super excited to use this but I purchased the SD recommended for this product and it wouldnt even close when I inserted it. Returning it now also received a "gift card" but Im not sure if its real or not.
1,Item broken when received. Rattled indicating something was lose inside. Attempted to turn on and menu kept scrolling. Coming from a technical background I assumed the motherboard was damaged. Had to return.
1,We bought this to film my son’s football games. The video quality was blurry and difficult to clearly see plays. We wanted continuous recording but it would only record in 10 minute segments. We will be returning this camcorder.
1,Think I just got a bad camera like too trade it for another one
5,great product!
2,The camera wasn't anything great. Video is meh pictures look good though
1,Difficult to use and record.  Cell phone does better job.  Husband bought second one to see if we just got a lemon but it didn’t work well either.  Sent both back.
5,Great product
5,Quality
1,As a web cam all of the video camera features are of the lowest quality. Zoom is not possible and the software the seller suggests is an additional $29!This as a web cam is garbage. It should not be advertised as one.
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Lamentablemente la cámara llegó con el botón de zoom dañado no funciona. Está flojo.
1,I have no idea to deal with this camera now! It had discoloration and grainy pictures accidentally. Who would need that? That made the whole video cracked and it’s CamCord May also get the same thing because the sound was blurry. So pitifully I have to return it!
5,Works good for the price
5,Great camera  crystal clear clarity
5,Great Product
2,Very frustrating that this didn’t come with an SD card.
5,Did the job
5,**
1,Volume doesn't work
5,So far everything works great.
1,Got this camera for my daughter to use. The cable that goes from the camera to the flip out screen is horrible. It is frayed and no longer works. It unfortunate I've had this to long to return.DO NOT RECOMMEND
5,Best cam
5,The best camcorder for the price!
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Update:The menu button works hardly after a couple of uses only.Very disappointed.
5,Wonderful!
5,Best  video camera ever!!!
5,great support
5,good item
5,My Son like you new camcorder
1,This product doesn't work
1,Purchased this camera in July.  It worked fine for 3 months then would only record 8-10 minutes before screen goes bto white and it stops recording.  Battery was fully charged for all 6 failures.  Don't waste your money on this product!
1,I tried six SD cards. The camera could not read any of them. Eventually the screen went to hash as shown in the attached picture. As a bad coincident I had the worst Amazon Prime service in my ten year history.
5,Exelente camera hd
2,Terrible clicking in audio. Returned.
1,Not sure why others are giving this a high rating this is one of the worst products I have purchased on Amazon.Maybe mine was defective but I certainly wont buy it again. You get what you paid for.Caveat emptor.
1,Don’t buy it!
5,Like the product
1,This camera is not worth the money. What a waste of my time. It doesn’t auto focus & the image is very bad. The picture quality is no good too! I’m so glad I returned it!
1,had to return. had better hopes but this thing was not good. super cheap. the reviewers lied. waste of time .
1,Does not work. Will not record. It does not recognize any memory card. I thought it was the memory card so I bought 5 different ones and none of them work. Very upsetting. It was a gift for my daughters birthday.
1,I tried to video tape my kids soccer games this weekend and the quality of the video was terrible. First of all the image was small batteries did not hold a good charge zoom was slow and lacks distance.
1,The video quality was very blurred/pixelated/low resolution.  The audio pick-up was bad (you can barely hear the sound).  I took outdoor videos ... the quality wasn’t good.  It’s easy on the pocket for a reason.
5,Headline says it all.
1,I was excited when the package came and even more excited upon opening it because it was so neatly packed. But once I charged it and started using it I was disappointed. The camera is cheap plastic that feels like it will break any minute.
2,Picture is very pixelated.  Very poor quality!
5,Really good
1,The video it takes is horrible.  There is no sound quality whatsoever.  Spend your money elsewhere.  We get the whole bottom half of the video with pinkish lines and the playback is shuttered.
5,Nice camera for the price
1,Right when I installed the SIM card into the camera the screen on the camera started flickering and the camera basically broke right when I initially attempted to use it.  I'd suggested a different camera choice 100%
2,Seems to be made pretty cheap
5,Great Camcorder !
1,Very cheap. Zoom toggle doesn’t work at all and feels like it would snap off without much force. For the price I guess you get what you pay for but this seems a little ridiculous.
1,We placed the memory card and the camera kept registering as an error we had to return it. Very weak
2,Nice all but no charger
5,Good
5,2 batteries
5,Was a gift
1,Very disappointed in this camera.  The zoom doesn't work and Amazon wouldn't replace it.
1,I was surprised and disappointed at the poor quality of materials. Lacking substance. Do yourself a favor. Spend a little more and get one that’s not totally plastic.
1,Everything total disappointmentZoom component is very flimsy and has a very cheap plastic outlook and it picture quality is very basic
1,Not happy with this bad quality. Very cheap
1,I really wanted to like this but it did not work well at all. It doesn't focus and it doesn't work for youtube as stated. I am returning. Honestly my smartphone works better.
1,product didn’t zoom in and battery spring broke
5,Great deal
5,Good value.
5,Pretty neat device
2,Not very durable
5,Love it
1,Bought to video children sporting events. Not happy with it.. picture is blurry.. Camera zoom doesn't work on device. It's plastic and feels like it is going to brake.
1,Save your money. Expensive plastic. From the construct of the camera to the operation does not meet expectations. I was interested in buying some cameras for my coworkers but that ain’t happening. Huge upset
1,The video quality is very poor there is no instructions and the display is not intuitive. I returned.
1,Not satisfied with the picture quality...My cell phone has a better picture quality then this camera when you play back a video it shows this weird film grid not a very clear picture at all
1,Nice camera but it's plastic and didn't record correctly
1,Well I bought two cameras  here I have them today and they both work fine until you try to record something. Then they halt function and blink or show a green screen.
5,Easy to use
1,Doesn't work! I never even got to use this camcorder. The first time I tried it had lines across the screen and wouldn’t charge. I bought a brand new card for it same result. So disappointed!!
1,This camera recorded videos with low picture quality. My girlfriends cellphone would record better videos than this camera not to mention that the settings would default once the battery died. Not a good piece of electronic.
5,👍🏻
1,Is product never recorded anything if you push the record button it starts making staticy pictures on the screen in record to nothing biggest waste of money and unfortunately I already threw away the box
1,Doesn't record sound/voice. Playback is dark no way to lighten. Wish I could return it.
5,Good
2,Poor picture qualitity
5,good
1,Literally the same day as opening the camera it froze and started to glitch after multiple times of trying to attempt to turn the camera off it just stayed on a glitching screen.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Very nice!
1,Horrible cheap camera that freezes has no zoom and terrible picture.  Returned the same day.
1,Product is nice but the zoom button isn’t working? Maybe we received a defective item..? Has this happened to anyone else?
1,I got this as a bonus for something I signed up for.  What a jip. No instructions and yes the sound quality is pure poop.
1,Returned!
1,Doesn't matter if it is plugged in or 100% full battery.  Stupid thing shuts off 1 minute into recording.  This is DEFINITELY being returned immediately!
1,I only used it twice and the screen went black and it stopped turning on... if you want quality don't buy this cheap plastic garbage that was made in China
5,Present
1,Feels like a kids toy. Like it was going to break in my hands. Every time I pressed a button it would either think for 3 minutes or completely freeze. Never could get it to work.
1,Audio is terrible. Tried to video in many different lighting areas with louder and softer sounds. All of them sounded scratchy and you couldn’t hear what we were saying. Not worth it!
1,The video only lasted maybe 24 minutes and our trip wasn’t on video!
1,If you purchase this do not respond to the Amazon gift card that is included. It’s a scam. Google the email address.
1,Purchased this on Prime Day as a Christmas gift for my son.  Save your money for something else.  This is a piece of junk and does not work.
1,The batteries are dead and don't charge. Buy with caution.
5,Good camera
1,This is a Kidd’s camera. Poor image quality that got worse even when you zoomed in. Wouldn’t buy it at a garage sale. Best passed on. Sorry. Get a Sony
1,This camcorder turns on and off and that meets the description. Everything else is an utter lie. No HD of any kind no quality of any kind.
1,Not good. Video picture it bad and the sound on the videos suck.
1,I like the camera itself but when I recieved it I got no batteries(like the display picture) or even a manual to understand the product. Really?
1,Got this in March 2020. Now it wont charge. It works when hooked up to charge but ones unplugged it dies. Not worth getting
1,The sound is very very minimal. I think I got one with a broken microphone or something. You might want to pay extra for a microphone.
1,I just received my order today The volume is awful a rubber button was coming apart the quality should be so much better
1,Really bad quality no sound recording at all
1,Feels sounds and operates like a cheap flip phone. Sound quality is weak and choppy. My iPhone 5 video capabilities blows this away. Don’t waste your money! I want my $63.99 back!
1,Ordered this for my daughter’s birthday the screen display didn’t show anything but a fuzzy screen. Ordered a replacement finally came and did the exact same thing!
1,Camera was rated great but didnt work good at all....blurry and doesn't focus well.
1,I bought this for my daughter. The first one was defective and wouldn’t zoom in or out. Returned it and got another one. The second one wouldn’t recognize any as cards.
1,For an important funeral service I recorded multiple sessions and all clips stopped recording after 5 minutes. This is a piece of garbage.
1,This is the second one we ordered and the zoom doesn't work again so we're sending it back also for refund
1,Horrible product! Also did notCome with cable.  Called amazon for help they had me purchase a cable that they reimbursed for but it was the wrong cable.
1,Not worth the money. Poor res spend a little more and get a name brand.
1,Video is grainy not HD no video stabilization color is awful jumping from red to cool tones in the same shot. Save your money and try something else.
1,Arrived damaged late unsealed dirty and sticky and scratched.  Not sturdy at all and zoom toggle did not work. Very low light. Was gift and highly disappointing.
1,This instruction is not correct it tells me to press the "T" button when there is not a "T" button!
1,Did not have capability to upload  the audio of the video  just visual.  I returned the video camera immediately. Received the refund ok.
1,Absolute worst quality camera ever used. My moms 1985 camera was better quality than this. So grainy and super blurry on the zoom. Dont waste your money
1,I like the camcorder but because the box had no bubble wrap inside to secure the item the camcorder was damaged.
1,Product locks up and crashes straight out of the box.  Completely unusable.  Returning product and will look for something that actually works.
1,Horrible camera cant edit videos off this camera
1,If you have a smart phone use it instead. This camera has super low video quality. The picture looks very grainy.
1,Flimsy and much too complicated to operate. Had to return it
1,The very first time I tried to record it recorded fine but when I stopped recording the screen froze and turned green.  It kept doing it and I had to return it.
1,It did not work at all
1,Terrible. Product. Hard to understand directions. Terrible ergonomics. Terrible picture quality.
1,This camera did not work The video part of it. Sent it back got a second one same problem. Returned for full refund.

5,My son bought this camcorder to be able to record his adult league basketball games. It is a perfect camera for that sort of thing because he didn't need the ultimate video or sound but did need a camera that could record for a long period unattended and which could be mounted on a tripod and put up in the stands.I'll get to the review below but you should all know that one of the biggest reasons to buy this camera is the tremendous support provided by the seller. They went "the extra mile" to provide support for a technical problem we had. No other seller I've ever dealt with has been more helpful. You can buy from this company with confidence.Please see my other reviews to assure yourself that I have written lots of one-star reviews as well as rave reviews so if something is bad I don't hesitate to say so.The camera is easy to set up and has three modes that you access when setting up one for the photos one for the video and then a setup menu for the general settings. While in the photo and video modes there are two menus that are used to set the features for that mode. In the setup mode you get a third menu that has the common settings like date/time.On a camera like this most people will choose to use the default settings but you can change the white balance from Auto to one of the presets and you can manually adjust the exposure by adding or subtracting from the exposure. I do professional videography using high-end Sony camcorders and obviously there are dozens of features in a pro camera that are not found here. The one feature that I wish this camera had would be optical zoom. However a zoom lens is very expensive and would add a large amount to the amazing selling price so its absence is to be expected.The key thing is that most features not found on this camera will not be missed by those who buy it. Another way to put that is that this camcorder has everything you need to capture good quality video.
5,I got this to shoot my daughter's wedding.  That was a couple of weeks ago and we have been playing and replaying the video since then.  The picture quality was much better than what we had with an 80's or 90's generation Sony camcorder that to be honest was maybe 4 times the cost of this camera.  The biggest advantage to this camera was we were able to take the card out of the camera and put into our laptop and instantly work with the files pictures and video.  We haven't tried any editing yet but this is going to be easier than transferring tape to digital then trying to edit the video. The battery life was totally surprising as after purchase I purchased 2 additional batteries and an external charger.  We never needed a third battery but the external charger came in very handy since we were able keep three batteries in rotation.  I single 125GB memory chip lasted through both the ceremony and the reception afterwards.  This is a camera that is well worth the very modest price.
1,I am a high school speech teacher. I bought this camera to record students giving speeches. While the video is very good the sound is almost non-existent. The students are 5 to 6 feet away from the camera and even though I have them speak louder than normal the camera will not pick up the audio. I download the videos to the computer and turn the volume up as high as it will go. Sometimes I can hear bits and pieces of the speech but I have to have total silence in the room and I strain to hear any of the speech. This camera does not support an external microphone so it is useless to me.
4,
5,small & easy to use
1,The images looks like from 1990’s horrible quality the zoom is choppy. This is a scam!
4,Good camera for the price
4,Amazing gift for by 11 years old it is easy to handle and features are good enough for kids to explore their ideas  good value for money
4,Works great so far
5,Great camera for a good price!
4,i bought this camera so i could just record my summer trying to have a good time. But after 2 weeks of having it (i’ve kept it in perfect shape always safe and secure) the zoom stopped working.
5,
1,picture and video quality were atrocious. the packaging promised 1080p HD quality. DO NOT waste your money!
5,Yes I love it soooooo much works like a charm so much fun
5,Such good quality!
4,The camcorder is just what I needed for my son's games.  It's small enough to go inside my purse.  I love the fact that 2 batteries and the bag was included.  The picture shows great for my needs.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Just a little light no weight to it
5,It's a nice little hand held camcorder.  It will be great to take on trips.
5,Just vedio outdoor nature  and playing with grandson
5,Clear picture and works well!
5,I love the compact size and quality. Great value!
5,Love the pictures quality. Its light so not heavy.easy to use.received it a a gift
5,The Quality is great as well. You can zoom in and get great images and videos
4,Came with two batteries couldn’t get one to insert and fully charge correctly but the other is working just fine. Pretty decent camera giving to a nine year old for Christmas. I think she’ll love it!
4,Looks amazing  the camera is great for its price & zoom is easy to control . Definitely worth the buy !
5,Love it!!
5,The product is really good I've needed a camera for class reasons and personal use
5,I love this camera! I am so excited to use it to record my families summer! i wasn’t expecting much but the product quality is excellent and the overall camera quality is great! definitely would recommend:)
5,Very good. Reminds me of the camcorders from the 90's. Perfect for what I am looking for.Gonna film a little video while we're out camping.
2,Cheap quality all around. bought this in a pinch and since it had a pretty good rating I though why not. it records video but it is not HD by any sense of the term... the picture effects shift constantly the sound is garbage. and you can hear every button press in your videos. It looks like they put the camera of a 15 year old flip phone into a shoddy case. I'll save up for a better product and probably give this to my nephews to mess around with. i'll stick with the camera on my phone. at least when they say HD they mean it.
5,I bought it for my granddaughter and after playing with I think it’s a great camera.  The effects are awesome and the camera overall is very well made.  Included cables and two batteries makes this a great purchase.
5,I love the quality of the videos. And the camera is light weight.
5,It was exactly what my daughter wanted for her 17th birthday. So happy for her that she is able to take the videos and make the videos that she has been wanting to do. light weight picture quality is great and its fun.
2,Pretty cheaply made. I was embarrassed to see my boyfriend open it on Christmas morning. He was so excited that he couldn’t put it down the whole time the family was doing gifts but I saw his disappointment slowly grow as he noticed more and more things. The thing doesn’t even zoom like a normal video camera you have to do it manually in clicks.  I wish I’d gone with a different brand.The box included a card that said if I sent them an email after receipt with my order # etc that they’d give me a gift card for the amount I’d paid. I never got a response to my email.
5,It is very vintage and i love it
5,Great light weight camera great video will purchase again
5,I received my camcorder yesterday and am very pleased with the value for the price. It came packaged in a sturdy box inside of a case along with the cords directions and batteries.  Couple bonuses for me were the batteries had some charge so I could play with it right away instead of having to wait and a nice case was provided so I don't have to purchase one.I only plan to use this a handful of times a year so I didn't want to spend a bunch of money on one.  It is very user friendly the zoom stabilization and picture quality are perfect for what I am using it for.  The directions were easy to follow which made setting the device up very simple.I would recommend this camcorder to anyone looking to purchase.  A great bang for the buck.
5,Great
4,Bought this for an 8 year old to record home videos.  She absolutely loves it
4,Great camera for the price
2,My daughter received this as a Christmas gift.  The zoom was broken right out of the box.  Grandma returned it and had a replacement sent to our house.  Daughter used it for 1 video and then tried the zoom.  It broke after the first use.  Decided this camera is junk and simply returned it for a refund.  Not sure why we got 2 duds in a row or if the zoom doesn't work on any of the cameras.  Quite frustrating.
2,Although its compact and easy to use the image quality is terrible. It has a hard time sensing colors and anything closer than 3 feet is blurry. Was excited about it but unfortunatly will be returning. Save your money and by something with focusing capability.
5,Great camera and video recorder! Love it
1,this is something you would buy for a young kid..it isn't anywhere near high def..even on its highest quality setting it looks like a cell phone video from 15 years ago..I don't know how they can claim it's high definition..the color is horrible..sound is horrible..settings have to be set every time you tuen the thing on..I wasnt expecting much but this thing isn't worth buying..I bought this elsewhere for 25 bucks..idk how they are asking this price but glad I only threw away less than half of that..even being brand new out of the box the charging cable had to be wiggled just right to even get it to charge..long story short..don't waste your money unless it's for a 5 year old.. if you want something that takes quality videos..this isn't it
2,Video quality sucks so does the microphone barely can hear it’s so low should’ve been $25 if you ask me but it’ll do because I’m not a hard core video camera fan to be buying one $100-$7000
5,Easy to use.
5,This camcorder is awesome! I bought it for my children because they are really into planning and creating little skits together. This is absolutely perfect for them. It is so nice! I know we will also be using it to record family events etc. the picture is clear and beautiful and I love that I can hook it right up to the tv for the kids to watch their movies on the “big screen”. So much fun and such a great purchase!!
1,I purchased 2 of these cameras.  The first one had a bad zoom button.  The second one lost the time and date from it's memory and reverted back to the factory date.  Also the battery does not last very long the maximum SD card that it will take is 32 GB and it just feels cheaply made.  This was a waste of money!
5,This is nice quality fun recorder that will be used for my wedding. We love using it it's great for family memories
1,First of all I can't believe that I'm reading all the reviews and they're talking about how good this camera is. In my opinion these people do not know what 1080 P is. This camera might have been good if the year was 1970 but not 2019. The picture quality on mine is in my opinion not quality at all and neither is the video. Junk!
1,This piece of crap takes nothing but fuzzy video with no true white balance control.  No matter what setting it's always jarringly changing color at the slightest change in the light.  I only wish I'd had the sense to return it instead of trying to make it work because the camera in my phone takes ten times better video.  Now I know exactly what a "sponsored product" is worth.  I bet the Chinese kids who made it are already dead.
1,Horrible product. I got this to make home videos for my little one. I seen all the good reviews and thought it would be a good idea to see if it was even worth 80 bucks.. well everytime I press record it glitches. It won’t record. That’s the whole reason I bought the camera and it can’t even do its main function properly. This is a faulty camera. I wouldn’t recommend. Even an 80 dollar camera would be worth more than this piece of garbage.
5,This camera was given to my daughter as a fun little gift. It works very well and it is easy to use! Please note it does not come with an SD card. We got her a 128 GB one to use that works great! If I wanted to hook it up to a tripod it would be easy. It is small and compact and stores easy. It comes with two batteries and a charging cable. You charge the batteries while they are hooked up to the camera. I’m sure there are a lot of functions that it has that we don’t use.
5,I bought this item for my niece's birthday (11 yr) for her hobby of making YouTube unboxing videos! She loves it. It has been a great little tool for her to explore her new hobby. It is light small and fits the need. We are pleased with this purchase and would recommend it for simple usage.
5,I bought this for my 11 year old son. Its hard to find gifts at this age with kids so into video games these days. I was excited to find an electronic that would keep him busy without being a video game. Its compact and great for what I wanted it for.
5,I bought this for my son for Christmas. I've tried it out and I like it so far. Something simple and easy to handle and for him to get started with his youtube videos. I definitely suggest this camera if you're not ready to deal with something bulky and super expensive.
1,I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone if it’s cheap also because i got this as a gift for someone who likes to make videos and take pictures I checked the camera before giving it but the zoom button was damaged and doesn’t work also the material used to build was cheap not recommended.
1,Bought this on Amazon for a Christmas gift for my daughter. After 2 weeks the screen is black and does not work at all. I researched to find a contact number or emailFor this brand and there is no website or manufacturer to contact to help resolve at all!!! At this point i think the company is a scam and this was a giant waste of money! Anyone looking at this item do not buy! You cannot get any information about it at all!
5,Bought for my daughter who's a future photographer. It fits her perfect. Comes with 2 batteries. It works great! I dont have any complaints. Received about a week ago and she uses everyday.. cant say I love the caught off guard videos. But we're making memories. I give this 5 stars.
5,My daughter loves her new camera. She's started vlogging and this camera is so easy to use. We can plug it very easily into the TV with an hdmi and watch all the videos and look at pictures. We bought an SD card that goes in easily. We were very surprised at the quality and ease of use for such an affordable price!
1,This Camera is ok and it does the job but right out of the box there was no charger and the zoom didn’t work! I’m so disappointed because it was supposed to be use to film my sister birth of her first baby. I have tried emailing the company about a replacement with no response. I bought this back in December and still no reply
1,Received for Christmas. Set on a tripod to record for Christmas. Sound quality was absolutely horrendous you can't hear talking well and it is very scratchy. The video quality looks equal to my dad's camcorder from when I was born in 198 (aka terrible and there is plenty of light inside my house around 9am). Now my 1 year old son is going to wonder why his first Christmas looks like he was born in the 80s. Thanks for the memories no name brand video camera!!!
5,I bought this for my granddaughter to record herself singing and for whatever other memories she wants to capture. It works great! Love this. I will be ordering another
5,We love our little camcorder. Very cute small easy to carry and easy to use would definitely recommend. Oh and has night vision so it was very easy for my girls to record projects for school.
5,Purchased for my daughter's birthday she absolutely loves the camcorder! She's filming her own documentary now 😁
5,It’s has really cool zoom settings and the image stabilizer is off the charts. And when I saw the picture quality I was like where has this device been all my life?’
5,I brought this product because I wanted to start a youtube and you couldn't beat the price. I like it so far. I have to figure out the quality of the picture. Light weight durable definitely will be ordering another one soon.
5,This camcorder is one of the best I have ever owned. Not only does it come with a nice little useful case for it but it comes with a spare battery! How awesome is that!?  The image quality is crystal clear. The sound is flawless. I can’t wait to use it on our trips! Thank you!!!
5,I bought this video camera for my husband and he loves it. Don't let the small size fool you it is of great quality. We most enjoy to be able to zoom in close to objects and the picture quality is great too.My husband is more of the "tech person" and he said the image stabilization is what impressed him. A great buy I highly recommend.
5,My 13 year old received this for Christmas and loves it! It is very easy to work and she is having so much fun going around making videos of everyone!
5,Camera worked great and high quality video. Product arrived early great shipping
1,It was broken. Had to send back for a full refund.
5,Love this camera
5,Awesome camcorder! My wife loves it! Very easy to use and the resolution is excellent! Highly recommended product!!
5,The product is easy to use and light.
1,Camera would not charge. Plugged it in in order to charge the battery and nothing happened. Cheaply made. You get what you pay for.
5,This is an amazing little camcorder for the price. Great quality images. Our daughter likes recording short videos of her gymnastics and the pets it was a perfect Christmas present for her. It's also sophisticated enough for adults to use and compact enough to easily fit in a pocket or handbag.
5,My daughter watched the Christmas Chronicles on Netflix and was CONVINCED she needed a camcorder just like the main character in the movie. She LOVES it! She has barely put it down and is taking all sorts of videos of her whole family.
5,I BROUGHT IT FOR MY DAUGHTER SO SHE CAN BEGAN VLOGING. SHE LOVES IT GREAT QUALITY.
5,This camcorder is awesome! Great on the go.. captures scenery very well and family functions are a blast!
1,Son horribles las imágenes
5,I like that the camcorder can take photos and videos. It zooms in and out well. The picture quality is clear. It doesn't come with the SD memory card.
5,The Camcorder was perfect! Love it ! Highly recommend it !!! Easy to use ! And the price is amazing ☺️
1,First one didn’t work pressed record screen goes green or distorted red/green static have to remove battery to turn off. Replacement came and does the same thing. Unfortunate
1,Dont work..wont record..wasted money on memory cards and nothing. My son is pissed he got it for xmas and threw away all the packaging so now im just stuck
5,For the price it’s pretty good! Our phones memory are all full and this camcorder helps with that because we love recording stuff. It’s especially good in the outdoors!
5,This is a perfect little camera. Meets all your needs and is compact.
5,I love this camcorder! It fits comfortable in my hand and I love the picture quality and the image stabilization. My kids love it also!

5,I bought for my 12 year old aspiring youtuber so far so good. It's the perfect size for him to use with easy to ready instructions. Good for beginners. I would recommend the purchase.
5,I bought this camera to use with my AJA box for recording sports games for the University I work for. I have to have something small reliable and with excellent quality video in order to send video to our analytics company to break down into stats etc. This camera meets all criteria!

5,My daughter wanted a camcorder and this is the perfect one.  Thanks for a great product!
5,This camcorder is so easy to use.  My favorite feature is the ability to upload videos to my laptop with this camera.  Video and picture quality are superb.
5,Good
5,I buy this product for a birthday present my daughter loved!!
5,Video quality is superb! Received it early as well. Good purchase!
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I don't recommend this camera I had 1 camera and the zoom stop working in a month i was using it...then they refund my money then I reorder the camera... Well this camera zoom isn't working so DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!
5,This does not come with an SD Card - therefore it should not be purchased without a supplemental product unless your intended use is for Internet Streaming and possibly later outdoor non-connected videography.  In the simplest words it is not Wifi-Enabled and therefore must be connected to a Computer with a USB Plug which is included.  Internet is obviously required for all Wifi Devices which is already well known.  Repeat:  It does not connect wirelessly.The Software is simple to download but instructions are not clear.1.  Connect the device using the USB to the Computer with Internet Access.2.  Install the Software on the Computer ensuring Operating System Compatibility (Windows)3.  Looks great nice picture quality.4.  Have not checked Print Quality or used the outputs with other software editing tools so can't rate.On Screen Picture Quality -- not the best I've seen -- not high definition quality.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             This is a great camcorder with the perfect size for vacations or traveling. It records on HD and I hope that the program I used to edit the video made it justice.The camera comes with a beautiful case to storage it safely and the batteries came pre-charged but you will need an SD card on hand to use the camera.It turns on by opening the visor but it is possible to turn it off while keeping the visor open.I truly liked the video quality but I couldn't figure out how to use the Optical Zoom effectively; however I am a very amateur user so maybe I need to play more with the camera's features. I love the fact that I can carry a video camera in my pocket and get stabilized and better quality video than using my phone.Good value for the money.
5,this was purchased as a birthday gift for my daughter.  She loves that its so light weight and accepts her SD card she already had from her other camera.  It takes very nice video it's only 1080 but she does not need anything else.  It has nice options for attaching other devices like a mic.  It is also compatible with a tripod which should make for some smooth video.  She is still figuring everything out it has lots of options and is very easy to navigate.  the only thing I would improve is the zoom its not as smooth as some cameras.
5,I bought this vlog camera for my friends young son. He wanted to post about video games on you tube. He didn’t need an amazing quality vlog and we didn’t know how long this new hobby would last. So why spend a lot of money.Well I tried it video was great  definitely requires you to go slow. The quality of picture is really surprisingly good. If your planning on using it to walk and video goo slow. Pan slowly. If you plan on using it to v-log in your room or a more stationary video it’s perfect. No worries if it gets lost or damaged.
5,Very nice video camera for the price you cannot beat it! It does everything you need it to straight out of the box. Good quality sound and a great zoom with good pixels. The only thing is you have to purchase a storage drive so that you can save all of your footage on to it. Other then that it comes with two batteries and a charger. This one is just is good as one that costs $300 maybe not the zoom but still a great product for the price!
5,I bought this for my daughter to film footage for her youtube channel. The first one had to be retuned as it kept glitching but i think it may have been due to the sd card used.  Buy the sd card suggested! Now it works great. Light weight and easy for her to use (5 years old)
5,I got this camera to take some video while we were on vacation in Oregon. Got is shipped to our address there and had it in time for our visit to Crater Lake. Aside from the inexperience of the user the video looks pretty good. We have to get the hang of it for continuous playback though
5,We purchased this as a Christmas gift for our 7 and 9 year old daughters and they absolutely LOVE!  They’ve used it every day since receiving it.  It’s simple to use easy set up and took them no time to figure it out.  We wanted something that had good quality was affordable and easy to use as this is their first experience with a camcorder. The size os also perfect for their smaller hands.  So far we are very pleased with this camera and would definitely recommend it.
5,This has been a great camcorder and I intend to order new batteries for it soon. It is easy to use just open the door and record anything plus it has great lighting and audio. I use it for video uploads to my Youtube Channel.
5,Beginner camera. Everything came as it should. You need to be in good light for best results. Customer service is great
2,The sound quality of the camera is horrible the picture quality not good at all so I’m not even worth buying.
5,Yes I love this Camara  its worth the money the zoom and video quality 👌. Hand held and record great out doors also.  I would recommend this video most definitely.

Super cute.

5,It’s a great inexpensive camera it’s light and compact won’t take much room in your purse. I like the case too. It has really good quality of the video and zoom. It supports SD memory card up to 32 GB. It’s really convenient to film your kid’s sports events or to use it for learning purposes or if your kid wants to start a YouTube-blog - it’s easy enough to operate. I am impressed!
5,The product does what it is supposed to I like this and I know my daughter will too

5,Bought this for my daughter. She loves it! Its perfect for what she needs it for. I might actually buy one for myself!
5,I really didn't expect much for the price but was surprised - decent quality and it WORKS!!!!
5,Bought this camera for a Spring Break trip to Alaska. It was able to beautifully capture the Alaskan wilderness as I walked the snowy trails surrounded by woods. The camera can zoom & has multiple modes for different scenarios (like night mode). It can also take pictures as well! It comes with two rechargeable batteries and a built-in-handle. The handle was very useful when it came time to record a live-dog mushing event!
5,I loved it so much it's like going to improve on all my I loved it so much it's like going to improve on all my videos on YouTube I cannot wait to post them and it's a great start for my videos
5,I am not a techy but had no problem setting up camera to use.
5,It is nice
5,Good value for your money.  its not heavy but small and seems to be good quality
5,Recieved the camcorder quickly and nicely packaged! The video is clear and really easy to use. Perfect for capturing holidays and special events :)
5,I’m very pleased with the quality and functionality of this small handheld camcorder. Such a bargain and takes very good pictures and videos. I had a little trouble putting the battery in but figured out how to pull the tab down then insert it 1/4 of the way down. Everything else including formatting the not included SD card was pretty easy.  Very few buttons to figure out for someone like me who is technically challenged
5,I have really liked this camera so far. I bought it to record my kids sports games and for them to record little videos they do. Really good little camera for the money. Would recommend.
5,My son has fallen in love with this little camera. I think it's a great start for his YouTube channel.
5,Decent budget camera

5,i love this little camera great quality for the price that i got it at incredibly easy to use and a nice lightweight device.
5,We wanted a recorder just to capture long moments on video and didn't wanna spend hundreds of dollars.  Nice small Cam cones w 2 batteries and a case
5,Nice size easy to hold in your hand love that it have to battery
5,Some who bought this camera stated that it could only work with a stick up to 32 GBs. Not true. I have a 128GB stick and it works just fine. For what it costs it a good buy.
5,This camera is amazing for my 9 year old daughter's homeschool projects!! Its very easy to use and compact enough for her little hands. We are so excited to see what she creates! So affordable and well made!!
5,The camera itself has the buttons on the top front and sides. There is the slot for a memory card and a charging port. The instruction manual was easy enough to follow. The camera also has a wifi connection which can be used to control the camera via the app. The camera is easy enough to navigate through but the manual is there to enlighten. I like that the camera has an app and easy to operate. I like the fact that it does not cost a limb actually has a decent audio and video output. This would be great for a first action camera. I am impressed with it. I will be using It to film basketball games to make highlights for my sister and any trip we will take . A great camera to start off with
5,I got this because I needed something that was economically viable and still a great product.  This product has exceeded my expectations and has allowed me to create some excellent quality Youtube videos for my channel.  I would recommend this to anybody who asked.
5,Works well as both a standalone camcorder and as a webcam.
5,great quality
5,Easy to use and great picture quality.
5,I like the size and fits my tripod
5,I can see why this is Amazon's choice. The perfect camcorder.
2,The battery life on this camera really sucks.
5,I wasn't expecting much from a camcorder since it's 2021 but this camera is awesome. It's the perfect size too for our upcoming vacation so thankfully it isn't bulky. It has excellent picture the zoom is great. This is just what we needed to start capturing our kids memories for us to look back on in the future. This camera is a wonderful product for the price you pay! Definitely recommend this camera!
5,Good camcorder for the price. It gets the job done & exactly what I was looking for. Inexpensive & gets done what I need.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Everything fine except the fact that the zoom button doesn’t zoom in or turn the volume up but that’s just the little flaws...maybe I’m doing something wrong. I’d definitely buy again tho!!
5,love it. It works great for my first canera
5,great camera has a great color to the videos/photos. has different cool functions and easy zoom.
5,I bought this for my 10 year old nephew who loves doing puppet shows with his hand puppets to help him get into vlogging and it is easy for him to use and operate and the quality is strong for what he's using it for.
5,This camcorder is extremely user friendly and does fantastic quality video! More than I expected. ESPECIALLY for the price!
5,This is a very perfect camare and satisfying service
5,Serves the purpose

5,The media could not be loaded.
5,This camera is awesome. Great quality for the price and very easy to assemble. Comes with two rechargeable batteries cords and even a small case for the camera. All you need is a memory card and you're set! Perfect size to carry around and is very portable!
5,I bought this so I could capture me and my friends' trips this year.  It is good quality for the price considering this was just for personal documentation.
5,Got this to document our daughters firsts. Seems to be pretty good.
5,Got this for my 7 year old and it's great
1,Sound is only static and muffled. Even when video played on a laptop. I thought maybe it was just the camcorder playback but nope. Terrible.
5,Bought for my husband to replace an older model camcorder. It works great!  Love how easy it is to use.
5,Very nice for the price
5,This was the perfect gift for my son. He loves it. It’s a great starter video camera.
5,If you can sacrifice Quality & Battery life for the price your paying then its an amazing camera. I own 2 of these and they work amazing for me.
5,My children love this camcorder it’s compact and very easy to use
5,The camera is light and it records great.  The zoom is good. Picture quality is perfect.  Just what I needed for recording my little baby's daily life
5,Great product.  Easy to use and very good quality.
4,Family use and church use taking pictures of my grandkids.
5,Bought this for my son for Christmas.  Love how easy it is to use and the extra battery is super helpful.  This tiny camera takes great videos.  I can't wait to see where his imagination takes him while using this.
5,I like this camera just got it when zoom close in vids not clear enough to make out words but over all image is clear. I am looking forward to playing more with this camera
5,Comes with 2 batteries and charger and a case. Zoom works rather well. Good picture. Easy to function. Compact and fits snugly to your hand. Does not come with SD card.
5,My child loves it.

5,It’s a very beautiful camera and easy on the hand I really like it
5,Easy to use
5,Great! Perfect size for travel
4,I wanted a camera that could give me that childhood home video vibe and this is great for that. Obviously the video quality isn’t that of an iPhone or expensive camera.. but that’s literally what I wanted. The actually camera itself is good quality and durable. It’s small enough that I just throw it in my purse or backpack to take on the go easy to take wherever I want.My ONLY complaint is that it seems that my batteries take forever to charge and then even after the light turns off… sometimes they’re still not full? Idk
5,1080p. Can’t beat it for the price.
5,I absolutely love this video camera. It was a Christmas gift for my son.
5,Perfect gift for teenagers the love it and get a share of all their pictures a videos.
5,Absolutely loved this product! Very nice camera and very nice price. Everything works well and it’s very cute!!
4,This camera is decent for kids who are interested in creating videos or vlogs. The image quality is pretty grainy however and I would not recommend it to capture important memories.
5,Great little camcorder!
5,super really nice camara
5,It's everything I wanted in a video camera.
3,Pretty good camera for price
5,This camera is outstanding one of the best items I have ever purchased. It's small and very portable battery life is exceptional and most of all video and image quality is surprisingly good.
5,Great camera for the price
5,We bought this to capture all the firsts for our baby girl. The picture quality is better than we expected! Very simple to use. Great camera.
5,This camcorder is small so I personally took about 5 minutes learning everything and how to hold it comfortably. I usually use my phone for everything but I have wanted a camcorder for a while so when I came across this I just had to have it. The price is perfect. I also love that it comes with 2 batteries. I take a lot of pictures and videos so not having to wait for a recharge is great. If you're in a dark area the video quality becomes grainy but I have seen worse. If you're looking for a camcorder at a decent price try this one.
5,Great camera for the price and works great for what i needed!
5,I bought this as a gift for someone who’s had nothing but old cam corders & I can say this has been the best investment not only is it financial affordable it’s also an amazing product. Easy to use easy to plug in & easy to transfer videos.
5,I bought this cam corder for my 8 year old son for his birthday and he loves it! He says the zoom works very well and its easy to use! I like how small it is :) it's easy for him to hold. Perfect cam Corder for anyone just starting out !
5,This product is so nice. It was a gift for my daughter. It has great quality and perfect size to take anywhere you go. It’s super cute. She loves it.
5,This camera is the perfect compact size. The camera itself is very easy to operate with good color and picture quality.  I'm convinced I got a lot for my money. Very affordable withulout compromising quality.
5,Best camera. Best vendor.Very quick services. Received within 10 days of ordering in Saudi ArabiaOverall very nice product
5,I Loved!!! Very good quality.
5,We love this camera
5,Quality is good so far.
5,I got this camera so my 8 year old would stop taking my phone to record videos. So far so good!It came with 2 batteries and a little case.She really likes that you can flip the screen around so she can see while she is recording. Apparently you can take photos as well which I wasn't expecting (I didn't really read the description before buying)I have two tri-pods at home and the camera wouldn't fit in either of those. I'll have to look for something online. However - the camera has a flat bottom so in lieu of a tripod I can just set it on something flat (desk shelf etc) and it will work fine.
4,Seems to function well especially for the cost.
5,I purchased this to start blogging for social media. I love how this is small and compact. It comes with a case to protect it from getting damaged. It also has two batteries. The cords and charger to connect to the computer and charge at the same time. To achieve image stabilization I would recommend getting the tripod. It’s a great addition for capturing pictures and videos. The camcorder itself is incredible. I will be getting the microphone to improve the sound quality and see how that goes. I would buy this again and recommend to others who enjoy capturing life’s moments. You will not regret purchasing this amazing camcorder with this affordable price.
5,Perfect camcorder light weight sleek small design. I recommend this stabilization is good on this. Loved the HD quality
5,I got this camcorder for my son who is interested in vlogging. This is a great beginners camcorder. It is small and doesn't come with too mnany confusing buttons. It is simple and easy to use. The camera quality is great. It comes with the strap for your hand. It has CMOS sensor and full HD 1080P. The picture comes out great. It does not come with a memory card but supports one if you need. The stabilization is good. It has 16X powerful zoom. The screen does turn to front facing. It comes with 2 rechargable batteries a charging port and a usp port to plug into a tv or computer. This even comes with a case! I would highly recommend!
5,I am giving the product a 5 star review because of the customer service that we received when we found that the camera had some issues.  They were very prompt and kind and willing to do what it took to fix the problems.  But on the good side  The camera was very light weight and compact.  I will definitely work with them again.
5,Got this for a Christmas present and it does just as described.
5,I was very impressed with this video camera. I wanted it so that I could have the nostalgic feeling of making home videos and I got just that. I love how lightweight the camera is I did not expect it to be that light but I'm happy that it is. It's also not bulky which I was worried that it would be. I used it on a recent trip to Dallas and was happy with the quality of the videos. I will also be using it on an upcoming road trip and I can't wait!One more thing to note you can add a filter on your photos/videos! I love the option that it has to add a filter on while you're taking photos or videos. There are a few different options for filters which I like because it isn't overwhelming with a ton of them to chose from.Overall I would definitely recommend this  camera to friends and family who are looking to start vlogging or who would just like to record events. It also comes with 2 batteries and can be used while charging which for me is a plus!
5,It’s easy to work and handle. Image is clear instructions are easy to follow and understand. Happy I purchased this product. Very satisfied.
5,I bought this for my grand daughter she loves it.It zooms in quicklyThe image stabilization works good. The picture quality is good.
5,Bought this for a road trip. I didn’t want to spend a lot on a camcorder so I took the chance with this one. So far I have no issues and I’m pretty impressed with how simple it is to use and the quality. I would recommend this if you want a camcorder that’s affordable and records decent videos. I wouldn’t compare it to a professional one but I am very happy with it.
5,Yes love it
5,The camera came in a nice box and soft case and two batteries.  I tried to set the date and time.  Overall the camera is sturdy.  It does work with 64 GB card.  It takes the full size memory cards.  (not micro cards).  I used it briefly.  As I use it.  I will report back as a written review.  Amazon delivered in record time of two days.I requested a manual.  Sure enough the manual was in my Amazon mailbox.  So product support is there.As for being able to work the camera.  I believe I have to work with the manual and the camera.  There is a learning curve.So I changed my rating to 5 stars.  The issue is with me.  Taking the time to tinker with the camera.No one is telling me to update my rating or bribing me with gifts.  This is done by my free will.
5,What a great camera for the price! I've been using it nonstop since I received it. It is exactly what I was looking for. It is loaded with features too!
5,So awesome little camcorder! It is really easy to use and transfer the video/photo to my computer.Also the size is compact and light  I put my bag and carry it anywhere.The HD high quality and sound also amazing.I really like my new camcorder and a great value for the money.
5,The camera quality is really good jus what I wanted for the summer everything thing came in good condition the zoom and picture is also very good I totally recommend you get this cam recorder. You won’t regret it

5,This product is honestly really legit. I love it so much. Does not come with an sd card though and you need one to take pictures or anything so please purchase one as well
5,Perfect small camera for events or everyday use!
5,This is a very nice sleek looking camera. The quality of the video is great. The fact that it comes with two batteries is very covenant. I would recommend this product.
5,Bought this for my daughter as she loves to make videos and take pictures. This camera really gets the job done and is very user friendly which is always super important. Highly recommended especially for the price!
5,5 stars
1,Absolutely junk made very cheap picture quality was very grainy even without any zoom. When zooming the picture shuttered. Pay a little extra and get something much better!We returned video camcorder back for a refund.
5,I bought it for my teenager and she loved itPerfect size easy to use
5,It was easy enough to use that my 13 yr. Old grandson loves it

5,I love it. It’s small compact and easy to use. The video quality is great too!
5,I really like this camcorder. It is not too big and small enough for my teen grand daughters to use. They find it easy to use and love the snug hand strap that keeps it stable and safe from falling out of their hands. I think I did a good job buying this product! I pant myself on the back! In this day and age children are obsessed with social media and my g-daughters are no different. I just love to see the smiles on their face when they use their camcorder and they dance and do whatever they do. Now I just have to think about investing in a tripod bcuz they use me too much as their camera lady! LOL...
5,Used it for my wedding and it works good for what I needed it for.
5,Amazing Camera! My first reaction to it was the famous saying of Popeye the Sailorman “Well Blow me down” as i was amazed with the quality of it for the price it was purchased for its an amazing deal! ! buy it now while you can!
5,This camera is great. Great picture quality and zoom stabilization.. Its great for my husband and I trip to Vegas. Great product.  I definitely recommend.
5,My daughter got this for Christmas and she loves it. It's easy to use lightweightgood quality for the money. Good battery life and comes with an extra battery so you have back up during filming. The picture quality is 1080p and she feels like a professional while making videos.
5,I love this recorder it’s great quality. It’s small and compact and you can bring it every where. I love the space it’s holds and also the fact I can record my special moments with my kids and family
5,Great value. Good Quailty
5,Product works great. Just as described. I did not have any issues and started recording within minutes
5,Muy bueno para pricipiantes en las redes como YouTube llega rápido. Recomendado!
4,Wish it had more Zoom power.
5,I absolutely love it! Perfect for documentary your collage experience:)
5,Good camera for price
5,Great camera easy to set up easy to use!
4,I havent actually used it yet but it seems good so far just messing around with it. I will update later in the season.
5,I purchased this camera for my children. They haven't had a chance to use it a whole lot so far. For the price I paid it does what it needs to do and my children are happy with the quality. The camera comes with all the cords needed to get up and running but you will need to buy a memory card. This was worth every penny and I would recommend it.
5,I love how compact yet efficient this camcorder is! I ordered  it for my 10 year old daughter to vlog with and it fits perfect inher hands. The quality of the videos and pictures is outstanding as well! All of the features such as zoom stop record etc. Were easy for her to find and use! Very pleased with this camcorder overall!!
5,This is a perfect camera for my daughter who is started her YouTube vlogging!
5,I would suggest they could supply one regular battery and one bigger battery.  It appears to format new sd cards when you put a new card in the camera  The camera takes very good video  The camera is good for  Youtube video and all around photography.  I has very good color rendition compared with what is really in the video.  This camera replaced my JVC video camera JVC thought that using some odd video format was somehow going to make people happy with the camera. I was not happy with the JVC camera this new camera fixed all the problems I had with the JVC camera.. You can't go wrong in buying this camera it works very well.  I will upload some video once the rain stops.
5,Love this product specially for the price. We’re not looking to do anything but capture family moments which we don’t need anything expensive ♥️.
5,Absolutely love this! It reminds me so much of when I was a kid and our parents video taping everything. I will definitely recommend it to my family as well♥️ also has sooo many features.
5,Awesome product!
5,This is a great little camera with good quality my daughter loves it
5,I love it just what I wanted it’s perfect for me
5,This is a great camera in this price range. It is very easy to use and it has a nice clear picture as long as there is sufficient lightning. You really can't beat the quality for the price.
5,Great gift for my son who wants to be a you tuber
5,Camera is as advertised. Nice little digital camcorder. Very nice for the price. The interface is bit clunky but it's easy to figure out if you play around with the buttons.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Love this camera ! I needed something to store memories with children! Great quality zooming can be a bit better but for the price I’m not complaining! A must buy !
4,Needed the camcorder for beginning therapy course. Works well so far!
5,I absolutely love this video camera. I ordered it and received it in 2 days. I was so anxious to see how it worked I opened it before Christmas . I highly recommend this product for anyone starting a YouTube channel or someone who just loves to record videos. Great quality and excellent price. I am happy I ordered this one.
5,This excellent little number is awesome! Incredible value. It shipped readily and expeditiously and came as described with wonderful little cover bag. I recommend very highly you try this number to make Vlogs or to film family gatherings! 5 star!
5,The best part about my camera that I love is the size. I can take it anywhere with no problem. The quality of the pictures are great and I can zoom in for a more advance look . This camera is a must buy.
5,ease of use and small size
5,Got this for my daughter for Christmas I played with it a little bit and may get myself one cant beat it comes with 2 batteries as well. This is awesome
5,Amazing product and low cost
5,Very lightweight.
5,I love it.. And you cant beat the price...AND  they give two batteries :) ... Hoping to use it for capturing memories with my husband
5,I love this product! Have been using it to film family events and it last all night plus take wonderful quality videos. Definitely recommend for anyone who’s looking for something cost efficient that also gets the job done! Wonderful camcorder!
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE ! The nostalgia I got from holding the camera was unreal! I can't wait to show it to my children and create memories with it. Sure you can alway whip out a phone press record. But theres something much more meaningful with a camcorder. Could just be the countless memories I have of my father holding the camera and recording the family in the best of times. THIS IS A MUST HAVE PURCHASE!
5,Making a you tube vlog
3,I liked this video camera at first and it worked well but now when I record after 3 minutes it automatically stops recording and turns itself off. Don't know why it does this.Oh and the batteries now longer hold a charge.I would not recommend this video camera as it certainly doesn't last long and is unreliable.
5,Really nice camera!Happy
5,Great light weight camera. Easy interface.
5,Great starter camera for younger kids who want to make their own videos. My son loves his.
5,Very nice u can decorate with stickers 😊
5,Very nice camera for price and very great starter camera for older kids my daughter loves hers and picture is clear only thing I think could been better is there is no way to turn up volume haven’t tried to put videos on computer but it should be able hear it on camcorder but overall good little camera
1,Camera wouldn't hold SD card.
5,Received my Video Camera quick! Packaging is nice. I have tested it our it works picture look clear but I am still working on uploading  my video which I will tape next week. But in my TESTING everything work fine. Great DEAL for the cost!
5,i saw it on tiktok and it was a really great idea to video all my summer.
5,Super easy to buy! Can’t wait to use it at our wedding.
5,good product
5,Great camera for a reasonable price !
5,It’s a great camera for the price. Perfect for vlogging if you’re a beginner.
5,I love how small and lightweight this camera is. I can take it anywhere!
5,grate product
5,I love it it gives me very much old camera vibes which is what I’m looking for to record my school experience.
5,The item is small and compact so it’s easy to pack and carry around. The screen is small however the picture quality is clear.
5,
5,I have only had this a shirt while but I used it this weekend at my daughter's birthday and was quite impressed. Only time will tell the whole story but right now I love it.
2,You kind of get what you pay for the quality was ok and the lack of auto zoom was fine filming my sons soccers games since I was trying to get a wide area but the really issue was around every 4 to 5 files were corrupted.  I tried 3 different cards with no luck. Also didn’t like how you had to open the screen to charge it.  I returned it after about 5 uses and kept getting corrupted files.
5,I couldn't believe the caliber of this camera for $60. I bought this as a gift for my daughter as a xmas present. Given the low price I was expecting a cheap low end product. Instead I got a pretty good beginners camera and with a lot of other "stuff" and 2 batteries.
5,Home videos and it works great would buy again
5,Great quality for the right price.
5,This camcorder is a bit smaller than I expected but works perfectly. The picture is clear it's easy to use and the battery came fully charged! It's definitely a good camcorder for beginners.
5,Bought it for my younger brother as a Christmas present. He really wanted a camcorder and I found this one that was a great price and had a lot of great reviews. So far he loves it! Its the perfect size. Easy to use and has great features. Comes with 2 batteries witch is a plus. Definitely would recommend.
5,I got this camcorder for my son who wants to be a youtuber he is only 8 so this was a perfect starter camcorder for him. It's easy to use and understand the picture quality is a little fuzzy but for what I paid for it's as expected.
5,Works as described. Awesome camera for the price.
5,I like how easy it is to pack around and the picture quality seens to be ok......not sure about the volune yet but seems to be really good so far.......im happy with it all in all
5,I love the product so far! Still waiting for the sd card to arrive to be able to record. So far so good. And the tripod is adorable light amd compact. I love it!
5,This camcorder is good for the price is better than others because of it battery life.
5,This is a great little Video Camcorder. I was going to miss my granddaughter’s birthday party because I was exposed to the Covid virus and my husband bought this and recorded the entire party. It has great video quality and easy to use.
5,My officially a teenager received this camcorder for her 13 birthday to start her vlog and record her dances. We tried to use a 64 gd as card but ended up purchasing new 32 gd and cards to work better. We kept getting a card full error message even after formatting. She absolutely loves the camera. Working the camera and getting it to switch to video and show the images took a little min to understand how to operate.
5,Perfect camera quality and great audio! everything works great it is definitely worth the money. can’t wait to go try it out and record the outside.
5,Look nice 👍Considering the quality of this product it's listed at a very affordable price and it well worth the cost. In addition to the camcorder we received two battery packs and a sleek case perfect for when we travel. We are going on an international trip in December and are very excited to bring this awesome camcorder!
5,This camera was one of the best items that I bought off of Amazon. I love the quality of the video it home it captures everything that I’m trying to record. I would highly recommend this to everyone who is trying to capture precious moments and life time memories.
5,I like that it’s small it does what it’s supposed to.
1,I wasn’t very happy with how dainty and cheap it feels. It is very small enough to travel with which is a good thing it makes it easier. But even when you press a button the whole thing just feels so cheap im really glad that I didn’t pay more then what I paid because I would of sent it back. But im keeping it because it does what it’s supposed to do. I don’t recommend this camera.
5,Perfect for our budding film maker! Got this for my 10 yr old grandson so easy to use he loves it.
5,The packaging was very sleek and put together. Came in less than a week after I ordered. Even came with a case which was super nice! It is very easy to work and the directions are super clear! Overall great experience ordering!
5,Very happy with the camera. Great buy for the price. Not sure how it compares to more expensive brands as I've not bought a camera in over 10 yrs. Bought this one to record kids soccer games and it works well.
5,First I must say that this product was very easy to use. It was also very inexpensive compared to similar products in stores. Also must add that it came with an extra battery which the two I looked at in store locally didn't. I'm a professional photographer and videographer. I used it to record a celebration. I will be using it to record a wedding in the future. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.
5,Performs as advertised!
5,I like this product
5,Holy Moly! This Camcorder is AHMAZING!!! I purchased this initially because i refuse to pay 2k for a videographer at our wedding and i wanted something to be able to take footage of our ceremony and reception. This is definitely the best bang for your buck! A little bit of a bummer that it doesn’t come with an SD card but other than that the whole thing is great. Small compactible great quality. I’d purchase again!
5,The stability zoom and picture quality is all great. It also has easy directions to follow. Only piece of advice: purchase the right SD card!
5,Really good quality for the prize! Got it for my 9 year old and 4 year old to make some memories they love it pictures are clear and not pixel at all would recommend
5,Good quality for the price.
5,So far this product has been great! Its very lightweight honestly a really good quality and I love the features and filters it comes with....11/10 would recommend!
5,
5,Great price with lot of features. Very easy to use and takes great videos. Come with a basic but very usable carry case. I have taken about 30min of video so far and the battery life is excellent. NOTE: If you are planning on using this as a webcam turn the camera on THEN plug the USB cable in. It should then prompt you on the camera screen to switch to PC Camera mode.
5,Amazing product and great price for the quality
5,I like the size of the camera small  light weight  easy to hold and zoom in on the subject the picture quality was great and very bright
5,A little smaller than i expected but works great! Perfect for taking on the go and recording/documenting memories! Seems to have good zoom/picture quality excited to put it to use recording family memories for our son to look back at! I know pictures are great memories but videos are even better... Great value for the price!
5,It’s pretty cool. Very clear picture. Sound could be better. But overall awesome
5,Nice little camera small could fit in your purse very nice pictures easy to operate! Would be a Great gift for someone beginning photography or someone who loves recording and taking pictures!
5,Super cute and easy to use! Works well!
5,The price
5,I ordered this camera/camcorder to capture moments of my newborns life.  I just received it a few days ago n already love it the only issue I am having right now is getting it on the right date n time but other than that it is great.. I would recommend this camera to all my family and friends
5,A simple camera perfect for taking videos on road trips
4,The zoom is not as crisp as I was imagining but this is a good product overall.
5,This is the perfect size! A great picture and something that will be easy to pack for vacations. It’s also the perfect size for our boys to use as they love to make silly videos. Great price and got here quickly!
4,Since Covid-19 the demand for webcam increased and all the name-branded ones are sold-out or sellers are price gouging.  I ended up settling for this as my "webcam" and I'm pleased that it works well with my collaboration tools like Webex Microsoft Teams Zoom and Cisco Jabber.  I'm almost certain this will work with other apps without issue as long as your MacOS detects it.Word of advise make sure you have an SD card in the camera so that when you power it on and connect to your MAC it will detect it as MSDC/PC CAM and you should be good to go to set your specific application to use "General Image Devic" as your video capture device.Overall the quality is pretty good I can't comment on the actual "video recording" quality and other functions/features as I will strictly be using this as a webcam.  Great alternative solution as a webcam and for the price of under $50 for an "acceptable used" condition- I can't complain since my peers can see me just find during our video conferencing sessions.
5,I got this product because we have two kids and we wanted to start recording more of them I was so surprised with how awesome the picture quality of the camera is for the price I paid! It's a good size fits good in mine and my husband's hand and it also came with a nice black case. Amazon got the product to me in a timely manner  I would definitely recommend this!
4,No SD card included with the device so 4 stars.
4,Seems decent for the price
5,Thank you sellerIts better than I expected for the money !!!
5,The camcorder seems really nice and has great picture/video quality!
5,Works great small compact easy to usr
5,I really like.how light weight and small it is and takes great videos! Also make sure you also buy an sd card 32gb compatible.
5,This is a very good camera for the price. Great sound and image. Easy to set up take video and upload in YouTube.Is way better than using your phone. The HD 1080 quality makes it a great addition in recording or taking amazing pictures. Its a great camera/camcorder for everyday use.It comes with all accessories except the SD card. But you can find one on Amazon at a very good price.Great product for the price and for taking daily videos or pictures.
5,So far so good! Zoom is as advertised.Good picture quality. Will see how it does Friday night at the football game.
5,This video camera is pretty good for its price and quality I definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to start off video grassing family friends are doing cute little vintage videos of people. I’ve use this camera a couple times and it doesn’t come with the memory/SD card but those are pretty cheap to get anyways or like $10 from target.The settings and working the camera is pretty easy to use I switch my video and camera settings to get my videos and pictures and more vintage look. This camera is lightweight it comes with a camera protector and I use it to travel and take it anywhere I’m going. A lot of my friends and family like using it and I definitely recommend this camera for any first time users.
5,Wow! This is a Great product.its compact yet it takes great video and pictures it doesn't take up much space so it's easy to carry on vacation or anywhere else that you might go.
5,I love this camera and cannot wait to vlog and my children like it too. I let my 6 year old to try it out and she loves it too and my 13 year old
5,Bought it to record the details/discussion of the meeting in the company and surprisingly got a good images and sound quality to serve my purpose. For the price it's a good buy.
5,Love this item! It arrived fast and as described. Will order from seller again!
5,My son adores his new video recorder. Dad is a professional videographer but our son is not allowed to touch any of the equipment for obvious reasons. So like any good parent I jumped all over his interest and we got him this kid friendly video camcorder so he could play with his own stuff. It is a real live camcorder folks. Just like the camcorders back in the day but palm size and kid friendly!! I have not personally been able to pry it away from my 11 year old to examine it but he has gotten it all set up and has recorded 1 movie on it so far. The only downside is that after one picture or a 5 minute recording session the memory is full. It might just need readjusting a bigger memory card or something but not sure yet. He loves it and uses it daily. Out of all his gifts. Hands down it is his favorite by far!!For the parents out there considering this the device is very easy on the pockets having spent $60 on this to make a kid happy was well worth it in my eyes. And also if it breaks I'm only out $60 and not hundreds.Definitely recommend!!!
5,It's great. Awesome picture quality and easy to use.
5,You have to play around with it a little to navigate the buttons mode and settings. Once I played with it alittle I was impressed. This is definitely worth the money. Picture quality of the video was very good and sharp. Love the zoom in and out. I like The fact that you can put a date stamp on the videos and pictures. DEFINITELY WOULD PURCHASE AGAIN. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.
5,Great first camera for my daughter future vlogger! Small enough to fit comfortably and easy to use.
5,Great battery life
5,Was looking  At a $300 video camcorders then came across this one which was a Great find & great product and nice features l. Also very easy to use good buy and video quality is very good!

5,He absolutely loves it!! Everything is easy assessable!
5,I love the zoom quality and picture quality fits perfect for my task that I have in hand
1,The quality of photo and video was so bad I had to return. Zoom is digital and blurry.
5,This camcorder is a great buy! It has great picture quality the zoom and image stabilization is a plus. This camcorder is well worth the price.
5,I use this camera almost every day! I originally got it for youtube because I wanted to start a channel and now that I have the camera of my dreams it's possible! I love that it was so cheap and easy to use! I love that it's compatible with all the tripods my family has and I love that I can do what I love while filming what I love. The picture shows up extremely clear when I upload them and that is why I rate it 5 stars. Also the fact that it can actually hold more video than any other camera Ive ever had! It's a nice look too!
5,Great camcorder! Lightweight and can take pictures and videos. Easy to charge and came with 2 battery packs! Make sure to read the manual that comes with it as well and buy sd memory cards!
5,Easy to use
4,I liked the retro look of the camera. The quality could be better but you get what you paid for yo.
5,Very nice for the price can’t go wrong with it at all :)
5,I bought this for my seven year old and she absolutely loves it! It is the perfect size for her and great for beginners. I recommend this product.
5,Picture quality was above expectations with this camcorder. Great product for a great price!
5,I bought this camcorder for my mom to use and she loves it. It is very simple to use and the picture and video quality is great. My pre-teen children also enjoy using the camcorder to vlog and make movies. It is very light weight and compact and fits easily in a purse. I am very happy with the purchase and recommend it!
5,I absolutely love it  easy to use perfect size and great picture quality zoom button easy to use and the stabilization feature is incredibe. Definitely worth the price.

3,Looks cheap feels cheap and takes cheap videos. 11yr old daughter hardly uses....
5,Works great for making memories and having fun
3,i wanted to make some homemade vlogs for fun but the zoom in button does not work. but so far it is a nice vintage thing
5,The grandson love it
5,I have to get use to it first
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I enjoy using this small portable video camera for my times away from my computer. It doesn't break the bank and gives you quality AVI videos. The built-in video screen flips around so it can be used in a selfie manner. Just enough features to customize your projects like a professional.
5,It looks very stylish and super light
5,It is very easy to use. Purchased to start making new memories.
5,I was honestly not expecting so much when I first bought this but i decided to try it out. I tried it out for a while and put in my own SD card (pretty sure its 128 GB) and nothing happened like some other reviews say. It charged nicely ( though the battery can be very glitchy it shows that its going to die but if you turn it off and back on again it shows that its fine) the zoom is indeed very laggy/awkward as its very low FPS. The pictures are alright quality for the price! It feels comfortable when holding and its not bad at all! I took it to a museum parties etc and it has held up pretty good! The menu is pretty confusing (not only that but for me i had to click mode before taking a picture because it wouldn't have let me otherwise and vise versa I had to click mode again so i can take videos) and the audio is low but as a starting camera/for fun i would definitely recommend!!
5,perfect little camera
5,We purchased this for our son for Christmas so he could vlog our life.  He has had fun with it.  The price is great.  It’s very user friendly. We haven’t tried to download the video to our computer yet but with what we have done we are pleased with our purchase.
5,It's small and light that fits in my handbag which is nice.  The picture quality is OK although pictures tend to be a little more white washed than the ones I take by iphone.  Overall I am happy.
5,We liked it but we didn’t like how there was no internal storage space. It needs a sd card.
5,I bought this camcorder along with a stand for my wedding. I did a test run real quick and plugged it into my computer and the sound and video quality are great. You do have to buy a memory card I got a 32gb one and it works perfectly. Other than that super easy to use!
5,I really like this camera. It’s smaller than I expected but that’s not a problem. Obviously the quality isn’t amazing but that’s what I wanted so it’s okay. I highly recommend.
5,This was a great little camcorder for the price! Very plug and play worked great as a webcam with my windows laptop!
5,Great quality!! The screen is able to flip sides that way you can see yourself while you record. Buttons all work perfectly and charger comes with it as well! Overall great product
5,Awesome camera especially for kids.
5,Love this camera! Easy to set up and a pretty clear picture especially for the price. Audio was also pretty good! So fun to use and cannot wait to use this summer!
5,I needed this to help with my son's football footage. Great little camera.
5,Records longer then I thought. Helps me to keep focus on my projects.I was amaze how long it records.It gave me what I needed. 32 gb is about 8 hours long.
5,Needed this for Christmas and I’m so happy i got it! It’s so nice and the perfect size!
5,This compact video camera delivers good quality at a reasonable price. It is great size for a hand held camera and is lightweight!
5,Great product! Got this for a 6 year old to start her YouTube channel and this is a fantastic quality! Great for vacations too.
5,I’ve been thinking of getting a video recorder for some time because taking videos on my cellphone just isn’t the same. Remembering when I was younger and having home videos to watch now is a gift! I love the small size and how light it is! Great purchase
1,Weak battery
5,Family
5,Very easy to use especially for beginners. Purchased for my 10 year olds birthday and he loves it. Totally worth it!
5,This camera is everything I could expect. No it is not perfect and it will not catch everything in UHD definition. However it is a camera (on the cheaper side) and can be used to capture some of life's moments. No regrets from the purchase and depending on how good of a cam you need or want it will work just fine for most people.
5,This is a great little camera! I use this for my volleyball team games so that I can review footage and work on te areas that the team is struggling with. I was a little nervous because fast moving games can create blur on some recording devices...but I wasn’t interested in purchasing another iPad...so I thought “I’ll give this little guy a try”. Awesome buy! Battery life is great too...now I have to use both batteries (which it comes with) but that’s not really a big deal being that a tournament can last several hours...and if we are off for a game or two I just plug it in and charge it while we wait.  Get one! You won’t be disappointed! Oh did I mention that it’s small enough to throw in your bag and go...carrying papers balls carts and water bottles...I don’t have the hands to be lugging around anything else...I can toss this in the bag and go!
5,Great easy operation
5,I bought this camera for my daughter for her birthday. It is the perfect size. It light and fits in the palm of you hand.  If easy to use and the quality isn't bad for the price. She loves it. Has a good battery life and it comes with two!
5,I would shop Amazon any time the camera was great quality👍
5,Brought this camcorder for my daughter as a early birthday gift in she love it.
5,Shipping very fast ! Camera is great for beginning vlogging ! I purchased the camera for my 8 year old.
5,Good product for the prize it was a gift for my daughter's 10th birthday she loved it.
5,Excellent quality product especially given the price point.  Camcorder was a gift for my daughter.  Very easy to use and the extra battery lets you continue shooting.  The digital zoom is good but it is a digital zoom and not optical so it will function like a digital zoom - slightly choppy and image gets a bit more grainy.  The viewing screen is great and swivels so you can shoot from multiple angles.  It's small so fits in anyone's hand and comes with a carrying bag for safe keeping.  Great product!
5,I'm so happy with this camera the video and audio is great and it's very easy to use and comes with amazing features. I will definitely purchase again. It also comes with a cute case and it will fit on a tripod no problem.
5,bueno
5,It was perfect for my 15 year old.
5,Bought this as a webcam that I could take around and record some video here and there.  I opened the box found the battery plugged it in then plugged the cord into the camera/usb on my computer and it ran!!! No directions required super easy! Zoom works well and picture quality is great for an entry level handheld camera.
5,This camcorder is so perfect. Nice size perfect picture quality and charges quickly
5,Received the order quickly and looks just as described!  We haven't used it yet because it's a gift but it looks like it will work out great!!
5,It was shipped quickly and in proper packaging to ensure no damage. The camera was in immaculate shape. It is easy to work and has loads of options. I definitely recommend this camera.
5,I bought this camera for my eleven year old son because of what I read of how user friendly it was for children to use.  My son was very excited about this gift and within a short time was taking video and using many of the cameras functions. I highly recommend this camera for kids of all ages.  A great little camera for such a great price.
5,I've always been an avid video recorder with my phone but now that I bought a camcorder there's an added excitement to taking videos and creating long-lasting memories.
4,Easy set up
5,I love this product! I love recording my daughter!
5,I love the camcorder i got it for my daughter for nice memories. Its very easy to manage. Something vintage and easy to store
5,Easy to use. Cheap and convenient when your phone isn't.
5,So far it’s a great product.  Once I opened it my 4 year old was ready to start her own YouTube channel.  Think the family likes it.
5,The shipping was faster then expected. The camera has a very clear image and is amazing... A lot of features for such a small camera.
5,Never worked wouldn’t record and the screen was completely blue. Then it completely fuzzed out and wouldn’t turn back on.UPDATE:Great customer service. It was my fault as I did not format my SD card prior. They walked me through the steps and it works well now! Great little camera for the price.
5,This little hand held is great for the price.  Microphone stinks so voice over video is good if you can do it.  Requires a memory card purchase as it comes with little memory but video is not bad.  Battery life could be longer but comes with a backup battery so that's nice.  For the price this is a great little video camera.
5,I bought this camera for my grandmother and it was so easy for her to use not being tech savvy. She has been using the recorder and taking pictures. The image and video quality show up great when we play them through the TV.
5,This camera does what you hope. I have been using camera for 5 weeks now. Recent trip to Africa. I have the most amazing video. Close up shots of elephants and lions. This camera is small but packs a high tech punch. All the features of a camera twice as big and 1/3 the price. 32 gig memory card and 2-batteries will keep you filming for hours. High definition-looks like a movie theater playing on my TV. Full HD and 15 fps 24 mp quality. Highly recommend. Very durable and compact. Could not have been more pleasantly surprised.
5,This is a good product for a first-time camcorder user. The picture quality is great when I replay on my Macbook. The controls are easy to use and the camcorder is quick to setup right out the box.
5,I love this product soo much! The cameras quality is truly 1080p and full HD. The zooming in on the camera is a little choppy but overall the camera is great. Compared to other digital video cameras this camera is very light and very easy to hold while filming mini movies/videos. Overall I say you should definitely get the camera if you are looking for a useful camera to pick up and film random stuff.
5,The picture quality on this camcorder is amazing. The zoom feature is easily accessible and works well. I bought this for my grandson for Christmas and he loves it. We are very pleased with this camcorder!
5,I purchased this item as a Christmas present for my son. I charged it up and took some test video prior to giving it to him. The screen quality was great and the device easy to use. I have an expensive camcorder and the features on this little device are quite similar. So far I think it will be an excellent starter camera for my 7 year old can't wait for him to open it!
5,I love the picture quality and I used for almost everything
5,It’s later than I expected but seems of good quality
5,Really surprised at the function of the camera for the price.  Have had no issues and it is easy to operate and change modes etc.  Extremely lightweight.
5,Love this! Perfect gift for my 11 yr old daughter that requested a video camera. Very sleek and trendy looking. Easy to use and very high quality. So glad I read the reviews and researched. I picked the perfect one and she loves it!!
5,The camera is light  and easy to hold up video recording my kids playing out in in the yard. simple features and good for bigger hands the strap had plenty of room to slide your hand through and do  recording that is good because I dropped my last video camera in a lake because the strap was to small to slip hand through and hold on to it. So I was not using strap and hit a wave in the boat and the camera went swimming and drowned. So if you have a budget this is the camera for you.
5,This camcorder exceeded my expectations! Works perfect no issues!
1,THE PRODUCT LOOKS HORIBLE NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY...$ 64.99 OR WHAT I PAID...IT LOOKS CHEAP AND NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE AT ALL...IT'S TINY..NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY

5,This camcorder well exceeded our expectations for the price. The pictures are clear and crisp and the stabilization is great- even in a tripod in windy conditions.
5,Love this camcorder! I wanted something to capture my daughters growing up. Great quality for the price! I would recommend this to anyone!
5,I bought this originally for me but give it to Great Grandson for his 13th birthday.  He is so happy and said he had it set up quickly.  He said he takes it everywhere because it has a case and is so lightweight.  Glad I bought this product.
4,This is the first camera I have bought for myself and I can confidently say it is perfect for beginners it comes with an instruction manual and not one but TWO batteries!!! A concern I had before I got my camera was I wouldn’t understand how to use it and upload to my laptop but it’s all right there in the manual for us non tech people:). I am satisfied with my purchase and can’t wait to see what amazing footage and photos I create with this bad boy! The only thing that could have been better was packaging when I opened my box the wall box plug had fallen out of its individual pouch:( but everything still in great condition and worth the money.
5,Look great
5,The video quality is very good and the sound quality is good for the price. It is small and pocket sized with a nice handle for recording. Overall good camera for the price I would recommend.
5,Performed as stated
5,Love it for family events to capture memories
5,The product is a good value for the price the picture quality is great and the images are great as well
5,I got this video camera to conduct music lessons live online so I was mainly interested in the webcam feature it offered and being able to set it up on a tripod. I was pleasantly surprised to find out how light and easy it is to use for recording video as well. I'll definitely use this for family stuff and my daughter is already trying to "act" for the camera. It was a little slow to set up initially but after downloading the required software etc. it's been fairly smooth to connect to my computer. The only design feature I didn't really care for is the location of the port to charge the device. You have to have the screen/monitor open in order to connect it.
5,I haven't had a chance to use this item much but from what I have seen it is a nice little camcorder for the price. It comes with a nice carrying case two batteries and an adapter cord. I had to go get an SD card and wasn't really sure on the size. I think I purchased too high because once powered on the camcorder tells me it needs a 32GB (I had purchased 64). So far this hasn't seemed to be an issue.*Once I have have a chance to take more videos and download them to a computer I will add some additional information.
5,Great camera that does exactly what I need!Purchased memory cards with it.Compact fits well in had.The 2 batteries are a great plus
5,I do Love this product it is so easy to operate and the quality of the videos is awesome.
5,Very good
5,This is a really good video camera great pic east to use i am really glade I got this
5,I absolutely love this camera. It was more than I imagined it to be given the price. But Its amazing! Good quality easy travel size and even comes with a case. You'll just need to get a memory card of course.I originally got a video camera because I have memory loss after a car accident that worsens each year. I wanted to be able to capture my children's lives so I have something to look back on. I'm happy to say this camera is perfect for this.
5,Not bad overall for a first time camera.
5,I purchased this videocam for my daughter as she has a YouTube channel and this works wonders for her. Its easy to use with the expandable memory it meets her needs. Battery last a long time its a plus to have 2 in the box. The carrying case is made of great quality. She is enjoying and loving this product.
5,Cute camcorder arrived quickly. Its very light weight comes with two batteries case and charger. Only used it for a few hours so far but seems like a good camcorder. I will update again in a few days.
5,The camera is very small which is great for taking with us everywhere. Having 2 batteries is great don't have to worry if one is going to run out. The one issue that we have found is that there is a lag between when you push the button to start recording and when it does actually start. Not a big deal just something to have to keep in mind before you start recording.
5,This truly is a great camera!  The picture quality is great!  I wasn’t expecting it to be as high quality as it is.  Highly recommend!
5,Just purchased as a gift for my 7 year old daughter it's a nice step up from the kiddy cameras she had had in the past and the price was just right.
5,We bought this for my son's basketball team so they could record their games. The price was amazing compared to other cameras with the exact same functions.The zoom function and picture quality are great.The camera is easy to use. Instructions are straight forward. It comes with two batteries which is an added plus. What we loved was the ability to hook the camera up to the computer and easily offboard the video to our computer. We were very impressed by this camera and satisfied with this purchase. We have already suggested this product to a few of our friends.
5,Este producto es excelente! Ha superado mis expectativas por la calidad de la imagen el zoom la estabilización de.la imagen. Lo utilizo para crear vídeos que van muy bien con las plataformas on line. Además es muy práctico e intuitivo de manejar. La camara es cómoda y liviana.
5,The picture quality is great.
5,***  Updating my review below from 3 stars to 5 stars because of the great customer service I received for this product.  Seller contacted me based on my review below (which was not all that bad) and offered to refund the bulk of my purchase price for the camera which they did today.  So now I have a nice handy video camera that I can use outside plus most of my money back.  Pleasant experience.***  Original ReviewFor the money you get a lot with this camera.  I find as long as I'm recording something that's outside or inside at least a few feet away the camera it works pretty good.  The issue for me is that it doesn't have auto focus and I didn't realize how much I'd need that for up close recording.  If you're doing any close up work where you're zooming in on something just a few inches away......the picture gets very blury and there's nothing you can do to fix it.  Oh well.  I knew it didn't have auto focus as it clearly states that in the description but thought I'd give it a shot anyways.  For the money you're not going to get auto focus in a video camera.  But next time I'll spend more $ and get a better quality camera that has auto focus.  Also the sound in this camera is not good (very tinny thin and overall just poor quality) which I knew it would be.  But again what do you expect at this price?  You're not going to be using this camera to record a wedding or something that critical.  It's a fun little every day camera that does the  job and works especially well when videoing outside.
5,Bought this camera for YouTube. Its a solid working camera with good picture for the price. It is small and compact and fits well with my tripod. It shoots in full 1080p which the camera picture is solid quality. For $60 this is a great deal.
5,Good camcorder
5,Haven’t got into the nitty gritty of the camera just yet. However it’s a nice travel size. Comes with 2 fully charged batteries. (Will need to purchase SD card separately). Seems to be pretty beginner friendly has nice labels
5,This is a great camera you just need make sure your lighting is good. The audio isn't bad either and if you are unsatisfied you can but a microphone. I like the camera myself and I like how it comes with a small carrier for the camera. Overall great purchase
5,Great low cost video camera
5,I wanted to have a camcorder for a long time but couldn’t settle on one. Then I found kicteck Camcorder and I really liked all the features. Since this is my first one it’s special for me. I am yet to discover all the features. However I did take a picture and record a video and the quality is amazing! I am waiting to try all the filters and start my vlogging journey with my travels and unleash my creative side with Kiteck camcorder!
5,We are very pleased with Kictech Digital Camera. I recently bought the camcorder for my daughter that is 12. The quality of the camera was really shocking. She has shown interest in vlogging and Recordering her own “channel”. I was impressed with the picture quality. We also purchased the tripod that was suggested to go with the camera. Very pleased with our purchase.
5,This little camcorder is such a great bargain. If you want to video record and aren’t a professional this is a great starter set. My teen wanted to start doing you tube videos and this was perfect for him. Very good quality picture and sound for the price. It comes with a nice carrying case and 2 battery packs. You will need to buy a SD card which is pretty standard. Camera video and voice recordings. Swivel screen for vlogging.
5,I am so impressed by this camcorder. There were so many good reviews that I thought it was too good to be true lol. I bought this for my 8 year old daughter. She loves or. It's great for our family vacations so she can record and make her own memories. The quality if so nice. My only complaint would be that the sound quality isn't the best. It's kinda low. But my daughter doesn't mind. My daughter loves or.
5,the perfect camera if you know what you're doing or if you are just starting out. the only problem I have personally is just video quality but it's not enough to hurt what I have planned to do with it. in fact for my recordings it's perfect. but to some the slight pixelation may not be up to par if you plan on doing high-quality shots recording every movement of every thread on a person's body but it's great for learning. overall I would 100% give this 5 stars as it meets all my needs.
5,Perfect for capturing moments to remember forever. Compact and light. Easy to use.
5,Great quality. Was worried because it was so cheap.but i would buy again! Very sturdy good weight. Wonderful quality in picture and sound!
5,Product looked great when opened. Had a issue holding a charge at first. Contacted customer service they were great and quick to respond.  They sent me a new one right away. This one looks and works great. Very easy to use. I got for my daughters and it is great for them and their YouTube endeavors.
5,Its a great camcorder for the beginner. I bought this for my son as he wants one for his blog. He likes it very much. The battery has good life. Additional battery helps much when shooting outdoor.  I will be more happy if there is option to charge the battery separately. Now I have to charge along with Camcorder but still its not the big deal as it charges fast.  Happy so far no issues.
1,I used this camera upon recommendation as a camera to use to record a digital course. It has given me nothing but a headache since the first time I used it. The only thing it would be useful for is throwing it out the window.
4,Amazing product... Just memory card is missing rest all received.
5,It's a really good camera for a very reasonable price. Highly recommend for beginners

5,I would purchase from this seller again.
2,I bought this camera after being led to believe that it recorded good sound and sadly it does not... Not a bad camera for the price though.
