4,Like the product. Sound quality is great. However good thing it comes in a two pack. Used this one for around 1 1/2 months and piece snapped in my phone.
4,Just in case anyone stumbles upon the same thing I did:  When I first tried these I had horrible high pitched feedback with headphones - just make sure all your connections are definitely clicked into place b/c that made me think these were defective. After my own user error (lol) they've been fine and do seem alright overall .. especially given the fact it's a very inexpensive product.
3,I have an iPhone X. The adapter does sort of work. Before I can even get any sound I have to plug and unplug the adapter into my iPhone several times. The lightning connection of the adapter does not plug in tightly into my iPhone (it is kind of loose). Any subtle movement causes the lightning connection to wiggle out of place (no more audio). Then I have to plug and unplug the adapter (and try not to move a lot) to make it work again.
5,Great quality and works perfect.
5,They work great for what I need. I will definitely purchase these again.
4,Great for listening to music on iPhone through connected 3.5 mm earbuds. However for some reason you cannot hear a phone conversation on your earbuds through this connector
3,They work. Not the best quality and not very durable at all. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend them for long term use and they were not super compatible with my iPad.
4,Great
3,One didn‚Äôt last but a few days. The connector to cell phone broke off / came apart from the rest of the connector and I had to remove it from in the cell phone. The second one is still working!
3,The part that plugs into my phone broke off into my phone and I had to use tweezers to get it out. Be careful with them
4,The adapter fits perfectly for my iPhone X & 8th generation iPad.  The sound quality is great. It doesn‚Äôt work for phone calls but I didn‚Äôt buy it for that.
5,I‚Äôm now able to plug my older headphones to my phone. I‚Äôm old school and like wire to my phone.
5,This happened a few days after it arrived when I went to plug it in to the jack and the other one produce no sound.
3,Even though it was the right size for my headphones i had to struggle to plug them into the adapter almost force it in. You can‚Äôt control the volume with the headphones but the sound was good.
5,Worked perfectly on what I needed. Always nice to have an extra one.
3,It kept pausing my phone when it was hooked up to my karaoke machine but works fine with no problem on my car aux.
4,No reduction in sound quality from headphones (with slim connector) to my new iPhone.  Just hate having to attach this extra cable. It‚Äôs extra bulk but I blame apple for needing to buy this.
3,Static sound one one
3,Bought a two pack.  One worked fine the other could not keep a connection.
5,I purchased these for my sons headphones. They are pretty durable and have lasted against my son pulling and playing with the cords
5,Perfect for playing my music from my iPhone SE
5,No complaints.
3,Works ok sometimes no sound need to disconnect and reconnect couple of times to work
5,The product works great for its intended use. I‚Äôm glad I can listen to my Apple Music in the car now.
5,Use it to watch Netflix on my phone. Only think else I wish it had was a place to plug in a phone charger at the same time as well. Still happy with the product itself
2,Not a good adapter. I can‚Äôt make a call with my headphones connected with this adapter. The call won‚Äôt come through my headphones so I have to use speaker instead. The adapter works only for listening music and I can‚Äôt control volume with my earphones with this adapter it will only let me control pause or play.
5,They have arrived faster than they say when I bought them. I liked them.
5,I tried using it with my square and all it would say is please plug in. It was plugged in??  I wish I would have checked it sooner so I could return it but past my return window.
3,One works...the other one doesn't...
2,They broke after 2 weeks. Very cheaply made. If you‚Äôre looking for something quick and cheap it perfect but if you‚Äôre looking for something to last‚Ä¶Beware üôÖüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
5,As advertised
2,For both adapters the end of the adapter broke off in the "lightening" slot. Neither one lasted more than 3 to 4 weeks.  The previous Apple-made adapter I had lasted over three years before I lost it and bought these. I would not get these adapters again.
3,Sound good used earbuds to listen to my music in my iPhone
2,Only used it a few times and one of the jacks stopped working
2,I was so excited when I saw this product and got it.  I do not like ear buds and thought this perfect for my regular ear phones. I hate giving bad reviews!  I do gave to be honest though. Worked great until the plug that went into my iPhone broke off the first time I used it.  I am going to see if I can return.
4,Sometimes switches back to I phone speaker though
5,Economical and they work
4,It‚Äôs fine for just playing Apple Music or Spotify but on one app I used frequently no sound is transferred to my headphones
5,Worth it for the cost
4,arrived today and they broke the same day while i was working.
1,I ordered these two times thinking the first batch was a fluke.  I use headphones to talk on my Iphone and have been using the one supplied by Apple.  I decided to order some backup adaptors since I tend to lose stuff.  All four of the adaptors I was shipped allow you to listen to music on your phone but do NOT allow you to have a phone conversation.  I kept thinking it must be a problem with my phone or my headsets. but the original Apple adaptor always works.  I will keep the second pair for music but this is not the reason for purchasing this item.  I guess there is a reason to buy genuine Apple products.
2,Stopped working and broke within a few uses
5,Great quality great audio transfer.Worth every penny!
2,This product is too large to use with my phone case on.  Very saddened by this
4,They start out working but quit after about a week.  Been through a few and not buying anymore.
5,No issues
2,bought obviously as an adapter for my apple headphones upon plugging them in and trying to listen to music they distorted my music and made it sound like my phone was being held underwater. ü§® i tried to see if it wasn‚Äôt plugged in all the way but i was‚Ä¶ horrible sound quality and just a knockoff of apples adapter honestly.
5,My old one broke. This one feels sturdier. Been using for a few months with no issues so far. Definitely recommend.
2,I don't even like that I have to use these; Apple dropped the earphone jack on their newer iPhones and iPads and so I have to use an adapter like this. Anyway my Bose headset has a volume control and pause button that worked when plugging directly into the older iPhone but the volume control does not through this adapter with a newer iPhone (the Pause button DOES work). Same result when using an Apple corded earbud set. This product is fine if you are simply plugging into your car's audio plug or otherwise don't need the control capability.
2,This product is not for receiving or making phone calls. I tried to connect it with my aux cord and it did not support my calls. I then connected it with my headphones and it did not not work as well. I currently have an iPhone 13/ios15. It works okay for music.
2,Would have been helpful if it were more prominently described that this does audio out but not mic in. Still actually unsure if that was spelled out in product description.
2,Both of them broke pretty quickly
3,I was excited about buying these and I did but less than a month in and it just stopped working. Very bummed out
1,I didn't expect much for the price but these are horrible. My phone didn't always recognize the adaptor and I couldn't use the microphone nor the volume switches on my apple earbuds when using this adaptor. I had to keep my phone on the lowest sound setting and even that was sometimes too loud. After one month one of the adaptors broke after being a little bit bent and after two months the other adaptor broke completely in two pieces. I used the adaptors like normal so they shouldn't have broken.
2,Lasted about a month before it stopped working. Buy the official Apple adapter and save your money on this piece of junk.
2,It doesn‚Äôt fit all the way! It shimmies while slotted inside the phones charging port which means it moves while being plugged in which also means it loses connection when it does so. Pass on this item. The jack for your head/earphones is solid doesn‚Äôt budge at all. It‚Äôs when you connect it to your phone that the fit isn‚Äôt perfect so it moves and disconnects.Quality depends how good your head/earphones are.
5,Allowed me to use my old earbuds.
3,Work good for AUX. Not compatible with headphones with microphone.
3,Sounded fine but only lasted for two weeks. Went to the second one and it broke after a few days. Lesson learned
3,These adapters sound well enough to say listen to music but they have not worked as well for speaking. I had to ditch them because the person on the other side of the call couldn't hear me.
2,One only lasted 2 days.. hope the other one last longer.
3,Not a bad product but out of the two received only one worked. Had to return.
5,I haven‚Äôt used it a ton but it‚Äôs been a while since my purchase and it still works.
2,Wouldn‚Äôt recommend buying this product. Doesn‚Äôt last at all. After having these adapters less than 2 weeks they both have broken an one actually was stuck inside my iPhone.
3,The sound came through very well but at times they would make my music rise all the way up and lower all the way down. I have accidentally hit them on things not very hard and they would immediately break at the top where it connects into my phone.
2,The cables work fine for listening to music but do not work for taking calls.  Bought them because description says they are MiFi certified
5,Was able to use on all my apple devices and sound quality was as it should be.
3,Works good with music apps. But doesn‚Äôt work with speakerphone.
5,Thank you
1,Total waste of money. Says fits XS which is what I have and both did not work at all from right out of the package. I was going through cancer treatment so could not return in time so $ loss and could not use headphones when I needed them.
2,Had a drawer full of great iphone headphones with 3.5mm audio plug. New phone only has lightening port. Thought this was a great option to use existing/functioning headphones. This new adapter allows me to use my "old" headphones but I can not change the volume using the volume control on my headphones.
1,One of these in the pack came broken. The import part of the connector was really loose and didn‚Äôt allow any transfer to happen. The other isn‚Äôt physically broken but still doesn‚Äôt allow any transfer to happen. I tried to connect it to my phone then to my car aux speaker. I got my music to play for about 7 seconds before it just paused the music and shut down. This only happened when I used this. Please don‚Äôt waste your money on this.
5,Product of good quality and works as advertised
2,Just two weeks during
1,The adapted works as expected however after a few days I suddenly stopped hearing sound. Upon unplugging it turns out the piece of metal that plugs into the phone was becoming detached and no longer made a connection. Thankfully if did not break off in my phone but be aware of the possibility. The piece bent back and forth with even slight pressure.
5,My granddaughter  ask for them and say they are working well and happy to have them.
2,Good thing it‚Äôs a 2 pack because the first one ended up not working within 4 months all it does is sit in my car in the console comes out when I drive but still doesn‚Äôt last for something that is Apple certified
5,Does what I thought it would
1,Never worked properly.  I could listen to a podcast or book but didn't allow me to have a conversation on phone.  .....  oh well.  ....  then the first one stopped working completely as the part that connects to phone wasn't stable.  So.  good thing I bought 2!  ...  2nd one same thing.  Didn't work as phone headset but allowed me to listen to book or podcast.  then.  ....  within 2 weeks of use the part that plugs into phone was so unstable it broke off and stuck into phone!  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.  GO TO TARGET AND JUST BUY ONE THAT WORKS FROM APPLE.  it's $10 and will last until you lose it!
5,These worked great for headphones for my iPhone 12
1,First day i used the thing snapped in my phone where charger plugs in. Second one lasted 2 weeks before it stopped putting sound out. Going for better quality next time.
2,If you‚Äôre in need of an adapter really quickly and you‚Äôre nearly broke yes this is for you. If you‚Äôre looking for quality don‚Äôt bother. I have two pairs of pro sound engineering quality head phones and using the adapter with those headphones destroys the sound quality. The quality of my headphones let‚Äôs me fully hear how much the adapter messes up the sound quality. I‚Äôve tried changing the EQ settings and no combination of settings can fix the poor sound quality. Worth it for what you pay because you get two but it‚Äôs much more worth your time to pay more for better quality.
5,This product worked wonderful and I was able to connect my beats to my iPhone 12. Awesome product!
5,Funciona perfecto
5,When i travel these tend to break. So I quickly pick up a couple of wammys any cold kick some serious dooule straight out of the box.
2,This was huge for no reason. Very cumbersome. The lighting part broke as soon as I put it in my pocket and I sat down. You get what you pay for I guess
1,These did not work on the iPhone for using earbuds with a microphone. The other person could not hear me. I thought it was the headphones. I bought another pair and they still did not work. Waste of money.
1,This adapter only works for audio like music or podcasts on my phone.  It is not recognized when I make or receive calls and the phone call comes through the handset even when my earbuds are connected with this thing.  Wish I could return but I did not realize there was a problem with phone calls until yesterday and I am past the return window.  Beware!
1,#1 of the #2 cables C-port separated from the product the second time I used it! Which I am very unhappy about because I did not have the #2 cable on-hand at the time and that task I was performing was one of the primary reasons I purchased the cable for use during..Ugghh!!
3,It‚Äôs been a week and already the first one has shorted out!
1,I threw them away after they didn‚Äôt even allow me to use my work headphones on my iPhone. They did not work-I suggest Pay more money to get just 1 adapter that works BECAUSE I had to turn around and buy another one for more $!!!
1,This product is cheap so it doesn‚Äôt do well under a bit of stress. Used them to listen to music while I work with my headphones in at home. Would keep phone in my pocket with adapter towards the exit. The part that gets damaged is the tip I believe the constant getting up and down bends the tip while in pocket and just breaks off easily. Lasted 1 week each adapter jack. No bueno
1,They work but barely. You happen to touch the cord and it disconnects. It‚Äôs stiff and bulky. I needed something temporarily so I won‚Äôt return it but if you plan on using it long term do not buy
5,Both the packaging and the cords were redolent of lotion which coated the cords. I wiped it off and it was fine.
2,It only worked for a few days.
2,These both broke within 2-3 months of use. Not worth the money.
5,I cannot say anything more about this product it is excellent.
1,Both adapters would cut in and out if they weren't positioned just right.  Sound mixed intermittently with crackle.
5,Sent quickly. Exactly as described. Both in working order. No complaints.
2,The first one broke after only being used once. The second one just stopped working
2,Adapter doesn‚Äôt activate headphones on phone calls nor can I use the volume button on the headphones. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm using basic headphones and not the apple headphones that came with phone.
1,I bought two so my son could use headphones.  He complained it did not work.  So I tested both on my iphone 13 and his iphone SE.  Neither worked while my dongle from Apple worked on both.  I would recommend not to buy this product and if you do for some unknown reason immediately test it so you can return it if it does not work.
1,These are not constructed very well. Both units that I bought the tip broke off in the phone jack after a couple uses.  Not a good product. Don't waste your money
5,The media could not be loaded.
2,Do not waste your money you get what you pay for. The sound was awful very static and it did not fit all the way when I plug it in my phone. I don‚Äôt understand how people are giving this product for five stars when it doesn‚Äôt work properly. I would return it but Shipping will probably be more to return
5,Needed to adapt to teach spin class. Sounds awesome
5,Great!
1,I bought 3 of these abs they are all broken. Within weeks of buying. I bought 3 previously they broke so I got more. And those broke. Never again!
1,Audio is choppy and doesn‚Äôt work at all unless at a specific angle videos and music pause and skip on their own with this adapter.
1,Our phones didn't recognize these as an input for the external mic which worked perfectly with the official Apple adapter. When plugged into a speaker there was a buzz and it would randomly start playing and pausing. Would NOT recommend.
1,These don't work at all and I tried different iphones headphone combinations and no sound ever came out. Finally went to the Apple store to purchase one off the shelf and headphones/adapter works
1,One quit working in less than 2 days the other broke and got stuck in my phone. Don‚Äôt buy!
1,Bought these for my teenage daughter. Within a couple weeks one stopped working and then the other broke off. She had used the Apple brand one for years with no problem until she lost it. I would not buy these again.
1,When I purchased this I loved the price but was also skeptical thinking: it‚Äôs such a cheap price seems like a pretty good chance that these will be poor quality. They‚Äôre not just poor quality. They don‚Äôt work at all with my iPhone XR. These look like Apple adapters but they don‚Äôt feel high  quality at all as soon as you remove them from their packaging. Then the ‚Äúfeel‚Äú when plugging them into the iphone doesn‚Äôt feel exactly right either. And sure enough neither adapter worked at all. Couldn‚Äôt hear anything through my earbuds. Complete waste of time and money dealing with these knock off‚Äòs. Why does Amazon even bother selling this crap? Just makes for a bad customer service experience. I‚Äôm printing the labels now and returning these.
5,excellent
1,I plugged them both in and I have an iPhone 11 and they didn‚Äôt work at all!
1,They don‚Äôt work with Skype or on call mode only to hear audio out from iTunes/YouTube e
1,Thankfully there were 2 in the pack. The first one broke within a day. Hoping the 2nd one will last.  **Edited to add the 2nd one just broke.  These were ordered less than a month ago.  Complete waste of money.
1,Not a durable product. Both dongles stopped working within 60 days of purchase.
2,The adapter works just not very well. The sound quality & level is not good. It‚Äôs not worth returning them but I definitely wouldn‚Äôt buy them again
1,Its suppose to be an adapter for the plug in wired headphones for apple but I'm truly sorry but it didn't work at all for me.
1,I bought TT use with head phones and they work sporadically. Not worth the money.
1,To play music on my auxiliary cord  in car the first one work that day the second one didnt
1,Its a scam neither of them worked. One broke just trying to unplug it from the aux cord. Theyre nothing but a waste of money and time. Its impossible to find one of these adapters that actually works without spending like $50 for one from apple üò≠üò≠üò≠
2,There's no control over the headphones. It's just a cable. Apple comes with a cable to control the volume of the headphones. But this one is not.
5,Cheap product sound was terrible. It worked but it was really poorly made.
1,I bought this because it comes with 2 for a cheap price but there is a reason it's cheap!! Need to use LOTS of strength to plug the adapter into headphones very difficult to attach. Plugs easily enough into my iPhone but can't hear music through headphones most of the time; it's more like a game of chance whether you'll hear through your headphones or if it will just play regularly. Very disappointed do not fall for the cheap price.
2,The entire unit fell apart in two days
1,Neither one of these work. Sent them back for refund.
2,Volume control doesn‚Äôt work when using adapter. Also at first I couldn‚Äôt get this adapter to work. I had to press really hard to snap on. First one lasted about couple weeks then randomly started increasing the volume. I would not buy again.
1,This product is very cheap.  Mine broke after only using it about 3 or 4 times.  One broke the first time I used it.
1,Both broke within 2 weeks of use. Garbage product - DO NOT BUY
2,Can‚Äôt used the mic on headphones or aux with these plugged in.
1,Used for less than a month and both broke. Don't buy.
1,By this product not being apple it causes defects in your speakers and microphone. I had two phones grow mechanical problems with this product. You‚Äôre better off just spending at apple.
1,I ordered these thinking it would be a good deal to have two adapters for a relatively low price.  They are nice looking they don't look cheap however the plugs don't work with my iphone.  I try to use them but they just don't connect properly or something. I am sending them back.  They say they are Apple MFi Certified however they just don't work. Very disappointed.
1,These headphone/earbud adapters did not work properly. They both had loose connections with two different iPhones. We had to throw them away and find alternatives.
2,Pay more to get the one apple sells these would cut out at random intervals I tried with different chords and multiple phones still patchy. If that doesn't bother you by all means buy it.
2,Not good quality have to twist my headphones to hear the sound properly. Get what you pay for.
2,For the money this product works as described. Not sure why one of the adapters failed after three days of use on an iPhone 10. Would have otherwise given this product a 4 star.
1,The lightning port tends to bend and then stop working better off buying Apple brand one. I also noticed some static through the adapter
1,both of these broke within 30 days but the first one already got thrown away so they can't be returned. cheap crap don't waste your money or time
5,Work just as good as real deal.
1,I bought these because Apple cheaped out on the Iphone SE and no longer include earphones with this phone.  So I bought these but the sound was really bad as was the fit.  FWIW the I phone SE is a downgrade from my 6S phone too-greedy.
1,Order a two pack of I phone lightning jack adaptersPackage came sealed sticker said two pack but it only contains one
1,Used this adapter the day after I received it. I went to unplug it from my cell phone and it breaks off. Leaving me with the adapter in one hand and a piece stuck in my cell phone. Thankfully someone at the airport helped me removed the piece from the cell phone. Save your money there are better options out there that won't break after using it just one time for not even 2 hours.
5,Great deal
1,Not good at all the part was broken
1,Both of them broke after a week
1,These are not what they advertise they do not work with your phone!
1,Doesn‚Äôt work. Don‚Äôt waste your money:
1,they didn‚Äôt work. tried both and it kept glitching. Disappointed I saw other positive reviews but neither of mine worked. The music kept turning off.  Cant say much about sound quality or material since I didn‚Äôt have the opportunity test this.
1,They broke easily. The volume is wack. Literally  just don‚Äôt get them.
1,Neither of these works.
2,Price is good but quality is bad. Lots of static after connecting to the phone & earbuds. Volume button not working. When used for calling can't hear the other party talking. will not buy again.
1,It does not work! I tried using adapter for my iPhone with earbuds and it doesn‚Äôt work
1,Both attachments broke within a month. Look elsewhere.
1,Shame on me for trying to get a 2 for 1. First I thought it was my headphones but it‚Äôs not. This adapter is awful. There is a low ringing baseline as soon as I plug them in but tried to ignore it. Then it will get all staticky and somehow just stops sound from coming though. Makes trying to run (or do anything) while listening to anything kind of pointless when I have to keep stopping and hitting play again bc the adapter just stops signaling. Spend the extra money. I‚Äôd much rather have 1 adapter that works than 2 that don‚Äôt. üëé
1,I was very dissatisfied with this purchase. One of the adapters appear to be used. The sound quality is horrible. I would not purchase this item again.
1,The first one only worked for music (audio output went through the phone speakers during calls) then stopped working altogether after a couple weeks. The connector on the second snapped off with light pressure.
1,product quality sucked and two times bigger than a normal adapter from apple
1,First it did not fit with my phone case on a case that has a fairly low profile.  Once I removed the case the sound kept cutting in and out.  I didn't bother trying the second one.
1,These work fine for listening to music/podcasts but does NOT work for phone calls.
1,Can't use to answer calls!!  Useless for me.They advertise as Apple compatible but if you look carefully the listing does not say it answers calls which I did not see...
1,does not work with standard earbuds with microphone
1,both broke after one time use doesn't work at all so bad
5,The media could not be loaded.
1,Used once and broke.
1,This product is terrible quality.. the metal piece literally fell out of the plus within the first hour of use‚Ä¶ just buy the adapter straight from apple. It‚Äôs the only decent product you will get..
1,I‚Äôve used this product like four times and today it broke in my phone. Disappointing but you get what you paid for it.
1,Sound comes in and out. Ain‚Äôt nothing like the real thing!
1,You cannot use this product for phone calls. Only for listening to music/movies. Returning and ordered another adapter that does work for what I need it for which is making/receiving calls on an iPhone using plug in headphones for work. If you don‚Äôt need this function this item did come with 2 adapters at a decent price.
5,Works fine
1,Had these for 2 weeks and both the lightening plug broke off
1,Cheap the lighting jack plug broke inside the phone the second day.
1,Don‚Äôt buy these. For some reason we can‚Äôt get them to work. The volume will not go through them.
1,Didn't work right at all.
2,Poor quality. The tip of one of the adapters broke off in my phone within a week.
1,One broke when I tried to remove it and the other just stopped working. Worth paying extra for better quality.
1,Does not work w my iPhone at allllll!!!
1,Plugged into both devices and it kept shorting out.  Returned
1,No microphone
1,I bought a package of two. Both had really bad static audio I have to push the adapter into the phone and hold it in order to hear something clear. Buy somewhere else
1,They would not allow the Mic to work when plugged in and kept stopping the video.. not a good buy
1,If it moves out any sort of pressure I‚Äôd applied it stops working. Waste of money
1,I got a 2 pack  the first one stopped working after the first week now the one I‚Äôm currently using is going out .. crappy ‚Ä¶ would not recommend
1,I purchased 2 of these and the first one lasted a couple of days and then the second one immediately came apart when I plugged into my phone. Save yourself some trouble and don't buy this product.
1,Sound quality was fine and the product worked super well for about a week. Then suddenly the part that goes into the phone snapped. I started to use the second one but that one stopped working in a couple hours. My stereo system works fine but can‚Äôt seem to sense a signal from the adapters. My theory is that they‚Äôre just poor quality. Would recommend buying legit ones from Apple.
1,WHEN I WOULD CONNECT FOR AUDIO TO LISTEN TO SOMEONE TALK IT DOES NOT CONNECT AT ALL THIS IS RIDICULOUS I WILL BE RETURNING
1,They both broke within a month.
2,Very static filled with poor sound quality. Will be purchasing a different brand.
1,This product broke the second day I used it. The tip that plugs into my phone broke off. Cheap Chinese garbage
1,That product was sent damaged it never worked.
1,Horrible product both of them broke with the metal pieces in my phone within one day one of them I put in and five minutes later it broke absolutely horrible product
1,My husband and I bought this set for our devices because they do not support auxiliary and this was a great deal to get two. downside is that it does not remain connected if a phone call is made. I also see that the device only lasted approximately 8 days and then the connection stopped. It no longer connected to our phones and music no longer played through the aux device
1,OMG.  From the minute I plugged this in there was intermittent horrible static like there were loose wires somewhere in the converter. Seriously loud enough to damage your ears.  Stay away from this product. I'm gong to order the real Apple product for a few dollars more.  My hearing is worth it.
1,First use of it made my volume rise and my phone to disconnect and connect and having to get a correct angle
1,Broke after 30 minutes of use.
1,Both these adapters would work with my music apps (Spotify Pandora) my earbuds would work though the sound quality was not good. Absolutely no function when making phone calls on the phone and connected to the earbuds. Pointless. Return and get a set that works.
1,Both of them broke immediately when I tried to use them
1,I got a two pack. Neither one of the dongle‚Äòs worked correctly. You had to wiggle the cord to make a contact and sometimes they would work and sometimes they wouldn‚Äôt. Tried both of them on three different phones each both did the same thing. I would not recommend this product.
1,Do not buy if you expect to use these with phone calls.  They do not work!  Poor description‚Ä¶I would return them if I could!  Buyer Beware!
1,I just started to use it and it never worked. I missed my return window so i can't get a replacement. Buy another product.
1,Does not work. Waste of money.
1,Both broke and one would only work on one side
1,This item did not work at all don‚Äôt waste your time and money. Totally fake
1,Bought this to use headphones while I cut grass (I do landscaping so- that‚Äôs every day). These are useless as you cannot control the volume at all which is important when you‚Äôre using heavy equipment and need to control the volume of what you‚Äôre listening to. Very dissatisfied. Husband ended up buying me an actual Apple one.
1,These things crackle and turn off podcasts restart them and other things. They are too long and stiff for pockets in which I put my iphone (rear pants pocket internal jacket pocket etc.). I feel a societal obligation to inform others to avoid this product.
1,These are horrible. Both broke within two months. The part that goes inside your phone got stuck. Don‚Äôt buy!!!
1,They are not as flexible as the one that comes with your phone I have to wiggle it around every time it plugs into my phone to get it to connect and one of them broke. I haven‚Äôt owned them long enough for one to have broken.
1,Received 2 of this item. Plugged in the first one and it worked for about a week. Plugged in the second one with the same result. Problem with the part that plugs into the phone. Very loose fit  will not stay connected. DO NOT BUY.
1,This item does not work with my iphone 11
1,It is not recognized as headsets or earbuds so the phone calls can‚Äôt be answered or make with this adapterWorks only for listen music
1,After a couple of days using this the dongle broke and no longer working.  Pay the extra for better quality that last longer.
1,Price & shipping was great but quality is awful. Both broke first day of use! Such a waste of money only to get a few hours of use. I do not recommend this product.
1,Sound quality is thin and bad.  Both of the connectors in the pack had a continuous 'static' sound.  If it had just been one of the two it could have been chalked up to defect - but they both have the same terrible behavior.A total rip off.
1,It broke within the first week of use. If you are active and walk with a phone in your pocket it will break extremely easily. Waste of money
1,Would love to leave a review but they didn‚Äôt/don‚Äôt work
1,Very disappointed and have the inconvenience of returning.
1,don't work with i phone even duo it says it does had to get an official apple product instead
1,The quality is horrible. I have to wiggle the wire to try to get somewhat of an acceptable sound quality and even then they are still staticky. For sure that old adage you get what you pay for really applies here.
1,It breaks too easy. If you press up or down at the connection point it does not have any flex and just breaks.
1,Both broke on first use. Got stuck inside my iPad and had to carefully remove it.
1,I bought this 2-pack and one doesn't work at all.  The other provides terrible crackling audio.Using a borrowed adapter both earbuds and headphones sounded great. So my phone and buds were not the problem.Save your money - buy from another vendor.
1,Unfortunately one of these broke the first use but we were past the return window.
1,Since iPhone has no audio jack I (like many others) had to buy the adapter.  Unfortunately these particular adapters are complete garbage.  Right out of the bad neither one of them worked.
1,Typical Chinese crap
1,These do not work.  Complete trash and waste of money.  Don't waste your time or money on these.
1,It works well for about a month and then the sound quality becomes terrible. You get what you pay for. I say skip!
1,one didn't work at all the other stopped working after a week
1,Very stiff and easily break at the slightest bend.
1,The end broke off both adapters. I thought maybe it was just the one set that was faulty and purchased a second set. Within days the same thing happened.  these are very poorly made!
1,The volume was very very low. I could barely hear even with phone volume to the max!
1,The adapter did what it should for the price minus the necessary routing of the call audio; if you ask me don‚Äôt get gypped. Spend the $9 at Walmart it‚Äôll actually work.
1,plugged it into my phone excited. then it didn‚Äôt work at all
1,This product does not work. Phone will not even acknowledge product
1,If you were to record the audio that results from these you‚Äôd get amazing lo-fi samples. Seriously though these are utter garbage. Unusable. Save your money and get a Bluetooth dongle with an aux.
1,It‚Äôs not apple compatible at all
1,Almost always makes a static sound and even if you can get it to stop it does last for long or there is some sort of pulsing noise
1,Unfortunately these knock off adapters just aren't worth buying. Both cable adapters stopped working after 15- 20 minutes of use.
1,Both of the ends of the cords broke off within a day or two of first use. Build quality is horrendous. Had no problems with quality of sound but not even lasting a week is unacceptable.
1,Broke right out the pack!
1,Very rigid and they stopped working (sound breaking up and in the end emitting no sounds at all) after 1 month. Would definitely recommend you to go for other options.
1,Stopped working after a couple months. I used them less than 10 times. Disappointed
1,I didn't like them at all.  They are useless to me.  They don't work!
1,Don‚Äôt work
1,Not worth it at all. Horrible quality doesn‚Äôt work well you get what you pay for.
1,Phone would not work
1,The product worked well during its first usage. As I reconnected the headphone the next day I started getting errors on my iPhone. Thereafter it didn't work. So returning.
1,These adaptors worked on my iphone for the first few moments of a single phone call. After that nothing.
1,They didn't work. what's to like about em?!
1,Does not work on iPhone X
1,Cheap Trash  lasted less than a week of use.  Will not connect to phone any further.
1,ZERO Stars - They just plain and simple don't work.
1,The little metal part fell out of both and the cord itself doesn‚Äôt connect well. A waste of money. They lasted a few days.
1,You have to hold the adaptor in the port at a specific angle for it to actually function. Any little bump or jolt and your headphones are getting disconnected.
1,Neither adapter worked.
1,Both of the adapters did not last a day. The ends snapped right off. What a waste of money.
1,This product does not do what it claims.  It does not work with my iphone.  I would recommend not buying this product
1,These do not work properly. Poorly made. I‚Äôm returning mine. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend these to anyone
1,Didn‚Äôt work whatsoever. Complete waste of money.
1,Sounded awful it‚Äôs is not compatible with my 11 pro max even though it says it is. üòû ended buys another one
1,Bought for my son and he just tried this product on 9/18/21 and neither one work. Return window closed on 9/14/21 WASTE OF MONEYüò§
1,This product didn‚Äôt even work at all I plugged it in and it stated not supported and when it was working sound quality was terrible
1,Cheap not happy
1,Really cheap quality
1,Very cheaply made and broke both connector within a matter of minutes when my phone dropped to the floorboard.
1,Both Stoped working after 2 months
1,Static from the start and the Lightning port broke off after less then 5 minutes of use. Waste of money. Do not buy
1,It didn‚Äôt work. Sound would come in and out and its just doesn‚Äôt work reliably.
1,The connection is super fragile and constantly drops. Pretty useless unless you and your phone are kept perfectly still.
1,These DO NOT work with iphone plug. I threw away my packaging so can't return.
1,Didn‚Äôt even work.
1,It just made my sony headphone sound like a $1 earphones. Worst sound quality
1,Junk after a few days it broke. More useless junk from China will we ever learn?
1,If they worked. Not working.
1,Had to return it.
1,These did not fit my headphone jack.  I returned them.
1,Fragile. Poor build quality. Not worth buying . Crap product .
1,What on earth? Such a waste of money they don‚Äôt even work!
1,This doesn't work. Its as simple as that.
1,Stopped working the first time used they went out
1,Both of the adapters broke after about 2 months. Not happy with this product.
1,Stopped working after just a couple of uses.
1,Both of them of them broke after 3 days
1,Don‚Äôt even work half the time brand new.

1,Neither one worked!
1,Do not work
1,I bought the esbeecables 2 pack for iPhone 3.5 mm headphones adapter (white dongle for lightning to audio). It broke completely after 3 months. The tip just bent and stopped working. Also it does not work for calls Zooms or Facetimes. Due to this I would like a full refund  please! It says the warranty is 18 months but I've not been able to find out how to start the warranty claim.
1,I bought this based on the reviews and to replace the adapter I lost from the Apple store.  I used this adapter ONE time and when I removed the adapter from the phone the lightning piece broke off - luckily it didn't get stuck in my phone.  I don't recommend this.
5,Lifesaver for when you need to use backup accessories on a newer iPhone with a lightning Jack.
2,no funciona para llamadas solo para escuchar musica
2,Product only works when I play videos on YouTube or music but doesn‚Äôt work when I try to talk on the phone or FaceTime
1,Boght them to go with headphones. After 1 week the first adapter stopped adapting so I swapped it out for the second adapter which lasted a week and a half before its plug snapped off inside my phone. Luckily it was half pulled out so the plug was shallow and I could get it out with my bare hands but that could have gone very wrong. Really limited my ability to wear headphones.
1,Got these for my son and neither of them worked.
1,The pack come with two and none worked. Couldnt return them because I mailed them directly to my niece and couldn‚Äôt return.
5,After I got my new phone ( iPhone 12) I realized I couldn‚Äôt use it without an adaptor so I ordered this. It worked perfectly
1,They give  an annoying noise not static more like a screak - sent them back maybe mine were bad or just terrible product!
5,Perfect for what I needed!
1,Was supposed to be a 2 pack & I only received 1
1,DEFECTIVE PRODUCT!!  Simple device but produce no sound transmission between headphones & IPhone.
5,These little cords are lifesavers for what business I do.Easy to use and never fails.Don't leave home without one or two
5,used on iPhone ;it broke in phone ;after getting piece out had to contact my carrier to get phone back up and running. You have to be very careful with it or it will breaking in your phone.
5,Obce plugged in they worked fine
4,Works Good
3,These do not fit snugly in the phone so they are difficult to use. They move around a bit and can cause the connection to be intermittently lost.
5,No los he usado a√∫n pero se ven muy buenos.
4,This works fine. But I don't get why it's not just a simple converter or adaptor instead you get a cable in between. It's really annoy to have the center of gravity shifted from the edge of the phone to somewhere mid cable.
2,After just 2 weeks it‚Äôs starting to separate
5,This is a good adapter for a wired connection from the phone to an amplifier system. Works well when for one reason or another Bluetooth is not the best choice.
1,Complete waste of money - did not work. I will only buy Apple products made by Apple or Belkin from now on.
1,Honestly this is probably one of the worst adaptors ever. This only last me a week maybe 2. But both of them did not last and broke into my phone. Do not get.
1,Insert broke off on BOTH first use. Do not buy.
5,good product
5,Good value and received promptly
1,Regret to say that one did not work. The other did not allow for volume control.
2,I'm sad... I lost my original adaptors so I found these ones. I received them yesterday and... 1 does not work at all and the other one works only for music... For the one that works the sound quality seems good.This is some what useless as I wanted one to go on my earplugs when I use the phone while driving and one in my car to listen my music on my spotify app on my phone... :(I will sadly return them I guess
1,Simply does Not work with several iPhone phone ear pieces. No sound and no ability to place or answer calls.Can‚Äôt even listen to music.:(
