4,Plugged right into usb in Road Glide pocket Bluetooth connected to my phone and it pushes car play wirelessly to GTS system flawlessly. No drop connection or anything found yet. Note I have the CarPlay adapter/dongle I purchased from Amazon as well. The two pieces have caused no issues.  Nice to not have to take my phone out of my pocket and have wireless CarPlay available on my Screen.
4,Easy way to add wireless CarPlay to my GR86.  Fits in the center console very well.
3,Just got it today for my 2016 Sierra. Installed it very quickly in about 60 seconds. Immediately worked without issue. Preliminary testing went well. Only time will tell on reliability and durability.Update:The device typically works well. Unfortunately every week or two the device must be completely uninstalled from my iPhone13 and reinstalled to the Bluetooth for it to work. It’s extremely annoying and should be unnecessary.Also the sound occasionally doesn’t work and you have to mess with the apps to get it to work. That seems to happen right before the device requires a complete reset. I think I’ve reinstalled the device half a dozen times since I received it.
3,Overall this product is good enough. It does what I was hoping to do which is wirelessly connect to my cars car play feature. Now the audio is delayed by about 2 seconds and every so often it will disconnect or shut off. But it's infrequent enough that I haven't gotten angry with it. I've gotten around the audio delay by choosing my own audio device output in Spotify. I'd purchase again
5,Very surprised how easy it was to set up and how well it works. I have a 2022 Mazda CX-5 (with an apple cad play USB port in the center console). I have an iPhone 13pro. I plugged in the apple play adapter to the car then connected my phone to the Bluetooth signal. Now when I start the car the apple play is connected right away automatically. Just want I was hoping for.
4,This thing is great love the wireless feature. Only down side is there is a 1 second delay when you skip to the next song. Other than that would recommend
4,Hasta ahora excelente
5,I bought 3 dongles and all works very well.Wrangler 2021Porsche Targa 4S 2019Taycan 2021 * need to upgrade firmware and setup some thing at de Porsche multimedia.
2,I have a 3018 Subaru Crosstrek. It works fine connected relatively easily. No complaints initially. First few days of using it I noticed more glitches. The touch screen would randomly switch over the phone screen within the CarPlay app as if someone was repeatedly pressing the screen. These are intermittent glitches. There is a delay when switching music. And I have used it to speak on the phone and the person I spoke to reported it worked fine but was quieter than using a cable regularly.So it does technically work I could probably deal with the glitches as long as I wasn’t relying on my cars screen for the gps.Probably wouldn’t get it again still deciding on if I want to return it.
5,Great item just like the tittle says plug and play  very Edy to connect
5,This a very easy to use hookup and interface with my car. I’m very glad that I purchased this item. Works with excellence and zero problems.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I have a 2021 Mazda CX5 and I love it except for the fact that it doesn't have wireless Carplay as an option.  My wife's 2021 Hyundai does and it nice to just turn the car on and have it connected.Bought this dongle to see if I could get the same connectivity as hers. The result is essentially a "yes".This unit only works w iOS not android but its brought the wireless functionality I wanted. Thus far everything works great.Odd that some cars its standard but others still need wires but this dongle is the easy fix.
5,Love it!!
5,It doesn't work for my car I tried it on a 2021 Mazda CX-5 and it works perfect.
5,Connected & it worked - Brought up mil Apple Car Play in my 2020 Ford 350L Twin Turbo.
5,This was a great product but it did not work in the vehicle that I purchased it for. Tried it in my other vehicle and it worked fine. Guessing the radio system that I have in the other vehicle is not compatible with this device.
5,I understand it’s cheap but it works! Don’t know why people are upset. CarPlay work flawlessly. I drive a 2016 Chevy Silverado. It took a a few minutes to figure out but just give it time.Would recommend for anyone who hates cables like it do!
5,I plugged it in and accepted the Device on my Bluetooth settings and bam. Done. No more fumbling or forgetting to plug in while I’m getting a call while driving.  This should be built in the car at purchase.
2,The Bluetooth pairing was fast and strong connection but the problem I had was when I played music with Spotify no sound came out of my speakers in my car. I’m not sure if it was a problem with my stereo but I’m disappointed that it didn’t work
2,This is the cheapest product I had for a high price. Very small plastic and light. It heats up when using. Made me really scary of this product. But speed is fast.. compare to carlinkit. Chinese tech products are getting a lot better but highly recommended to choose the brand wisely such as Anker(they are not in wireless CarPlay business). I will try different products
5,Works great w my 18 s class
1,Product is worthless.  Worked the first month that I had it and now it won’t go off this screen.  Can’t update it can’t reset it.  Now i have a useless piece of $50 equipment.  Do not recommend this product to anyone expecting long use from it
1,Doesn’t work what so ever on my 2017 Honda Civic SI. Expensive piece of junk.
1,CarPlay will work but audio won’t. Was exited for this. This was a real let down.
1,Plugged in and followed the instructions but it would not display phone. It never worked. My car play screen in my car just went black.
1,It drains the battery and keeps the ignition on. Had to get towing to jump start the vehicle.
1,It worked well for one day. Now it won’t stay connected longer than a minute. Constantly reconnecting.
1,Product didn’t pair to my phone .. not sure why.
1,Will not let Spotify on line thru my car’s wifi.
4,This works great.  Maps and music work well and it is connected before I can start driving.  The package is similar to apple packages. Simple clean and only cardboard.My only concern is that it never shuts off.  Will experiment more but it stayed on for 20 minutes after I shut the car off.  I took one star off for this.  If I find that there is a limit I will update this review.
5,I love this gadget! It turns my wired CarPlay into wireless. How cool is that! The directions were easy to follow to get this device connected. I’ve only had it not work one time out of the month I’ve been testing it but I think it could’ve been my fault. (This device works with bluetooth connectivity and I took the phone out of my car while the car was still running so it disconnected from the device. And then when I got back in the car it would not connect again until I turned my car off completely and restarted the car.) But be aware since it connects through Bluetooth if you have Wi-Fi in your car you can’t connect to the Wi-Fi and to this device. You can only do one oe the other. Cool device. Highly recommend.
5,This is my THIRD dongle. The first works but I replaced with a newer one that was good looking until it stopped completing the connection. I suspect that Chinese circuits do not know midwest car heat but THIS is a 2022 model that looks very "Apple" as in white clean TINY and has a better display (brighter). It plugged in went to my phone under bluetooth and it was a fast pairing.You NEED to consider how fast technology changes; in a couple of years the size of the dingle reduced to 1/3rd what the old 2020 model was! THIS dongle also has an LED light on the front so a user knows if it's working; small thing with a big positive use.I use this to use my iPhone's maps phone features and also Amazon Music and Spotify because let's be real: Toyota won't offer this because they have a kinship with XM and Sirius; Spotify is good and Amazon Music is part of Prime!The USB cable on this is short so a little double-stick tape puts the dongle partially concealed against the center storage console (Prius). So far and in hot summer it's perfect and a good improvement over the older dongles we've had but for hands-free ease it is GREAT. AND against the white interior this is good lookin'!
5,[Note:  I'm using this with an iPhone XS and a 2018 Nissan Leaf.  You will likely not have that combo so your experience might be different.]This worked far better than I hoped :)Pairing was trivial (plug it in open your bluetooth settings and select it then accept the pairing).With the correct settings it automatically connects as the car starts up and my iPhone automatically connects to it and Carplay starts all without me having to do anything (other than get in and turn on the car).It actually connects faster and with less difficulty than plugging in my iPhone used to take (that was always a bit fidgety with a direct wired connection to my phone).The only (minor) negative is that there might be a bit more delay when using voice commands.  I already had some in my car and this might have increased it by a small amount.  By this I mean if I hold down the "speak" button on my steering wheel it takes a short time for the *bing* sound to happen before I can talk and when I speak it feels like it takes slightly longer for Siri to respond.  It might add a second or so to the delay for the entire transaction.  I suspect this is caused by the extra link in the communication (bluetooth).  Considering that I use this a couple times a month (at most) and it adds a second or so delay (at most) I consider it an acceptable tradeoff for never having to plug my phone in again (other than for power).Update:  On a road trip I tried this out in my wife's 2022 Prius Prime and I would not recommend it for that car.  The USB port in our Prius is on the center console pointing up.  Because the cable on this adapter is very short it sticks up in the air and then bends over not actually resting on anything.  If I held it upright it worked as expected but if we just let it dangle it didn't work.  I'm not sure if the USB port is a bit loose or if the cable doesn't like being bent but whatever it is this device doesn't work well in that car.  I still recommend it but I wouldn't get it if your USB port is positioned so that the cable would need to point up.
5,I was a little skeptical this would work.  It just seemed too good to be true that it would truly result in an Apple CarPlay that is completely wireless. If you can connect your phone to your car via Bluetooth you have the skill level needed to make this a success in your car too!My 2019 Honda Odyssey had wired CarPlay and it was getting used quite a bit. But each one of those connections was charging the battery for too short of a period of time to be beneficial. Instead it was just causing premature wear. This wireless approach should help address that technicality.  I am pumped about it!
2,extremely disappointed with this they advertise it will fit 90% of vehicles I plugged it into the USB port of my radio which has wired CarPlay it came up on my Bluetooth list I connected it as per the instructions selected to use it as CarPlay it worked one time.  After I turned the vehicle off and came back a few hours later to go somewhere else it did not auto connect I looked under my Bluetooth settings on my radio and phone it was indeed connected but was not working at all.  I’d recommend just buying a cheap Bluetooth adapter it will do the exact same thing far more reliably
5,This adapter works great in my CarPlay. Now I don’t have to use a long cable to connect to my phone. I was able to connect through Bluetooth to my CarPlay. The only downside is that sometimes the music stops playing for a second or two but it goes back to normal later. It doesn’t happen too often to be too annoying but it’s something they could definitely improve on.
5,I have retrofitted a CarPlay/Android Auto unit into my Audi and it has honestly changed how I view wireless CarPlay/AA.  Plugged this into the Boss headunit in my truck and after a rather quick and painless BT connection my iPhone 12 Pro Max was doin the CarPlay thing from my pocket!  I love the fact that this isn't a "hardwired" install and if I need to I can unplug it and move it to a new vehicle with hardly any additional setup as it's already going to be paired to your phone.I haven't seen any excess latency or input lag while using this device but if anything changes I will update my review accordingly.
5,I plugged it in to try it and once it was connected to Bluetooth it works every time powering right up and getting Apple Car Play right up on the screen and it’s nice to not have to plug in for it each time. The only thing I found with this product is that the music controls on the radio or steering wheel are ever so slightly delayed compared to factory but if you want wireless CarPlay without a new car payment this is by far the way to go!
2,I love using CarPlay but I found myself often forgetting to unplug and take my phone after using it. I was hoping that this would solve my issue and at first it seemed to do so. It connected easily to my Bluetooth and the CarPlay menu came up. However after the first time while it connected it only showed the menu. When CarPlay was touched nothing happened. If I used my phone it would play podcasts through the speaker but I could not access maps messaging etc. on the car's screen. Even when I unplugged it and plugged it back in it did not respond with a full menu of options. Having to use my phone negates any advantages of this device.
5,This product does exactly what the description says.  Plug and play for my Toyota 4 Runner.  Not much to say other than its super simple to install and get going.  Its well made and looks great externally.
5,This device works really well. Once it gets connected I haven’t experienced any sort of connection or sound quality issues.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I had no idea there was a product like this ! This thing is such a lifesaver  don’t even think about it just get it.
5,This works great with my iPhone for wireless CarPlay. Love it!
5,Simple plug and play for wireless connection to airplay! Gets rid of all the messy irritating cables. Love it! Half the price of some other options but works just as well!
5,Only fitted it a few days ago but so far seems to be doing a great job!
5,I have a Ford Ranger and a iPhone it worked like a dream love it
5,So easy to use30 seconds and your using apple car play
5,Compact size so fits neatly away. Very easy to set up and works well. Phone can be left in the boot of the car and CarPlay still works wellVery pleased - good value
5,Works as advertised it’s a dream to use
5,It didn’t work with my car need car have CarPlay already
4,This is a great product if you have a car without wireless CarPlay. Set up was a breeze it needs both wifi and Bluetooth to be on. There is no input lag at all. Only issue: it seems to draw power continuously even after the vehicle is turned off so I recommend removing the dongle when stepping out of the car.
3,Overall it’s very simple to set up. Plug in the device to your cars USB port and link it it to your phone. The device was easily linked via Bluetooth on my phone but sadly the accessibility of it didn’t work on Cadillac SRX. Was really looking forward to have a more updated CarPlay feature but just didn’t work. I know it’s not the devices fault as it was acknowledged just like it said — just the car didn’t allow the item to be set up.
5,It works as described
1,I had really high hopes but this thing doesn’t work at all. My phone initially connected to the dongle but it continuously disconnected. Everytime I get into my truck I have to mess with it to try and get it to connect again and it never does. Poor product.
4,Works OK sometimes it disconnect from my system 10 seconds or so
5,Works well in my 2018 Subaru Impreza
5,This CarPlay adapter is extremely easy to install and comes with clear instructions and all cords needed. Works great definitely exceeded my expectations. Very responsive and connects fast. Completely changes the functionality of my old car stereo. Perfect for any car stereo that is capable.
3,So it’s been a month since I’ve been using this CarPlay Adapter yes it does everything you want it to. When the car is turned on takes about 5-10 seconds before it automatically connects. Music has a 1-2 sec delay to it thankfully calls are okay.Although there’s one problem I noted although very infrequent  sometimes it won’t connect on my 2022 Toyota Camry and might just need a little rebooting.But nevertheless it’s a good product for the price.
5,It’s a cheaper unit but works perfectly on my 2022 Sangyong Musso. Connected straight away and auto connects each time I start up. Shame it’s white but for the price thats the only complaint. Great unit
2,Use this for about a week in my car. It was awesome to have an easy bluetooth connection instead of being tangled up in wires. However about a week into use it it just stopped. Ive only had to plug it in and unplug it a few times so I don't understand what went wrong im thinking a wire or something inside muet has disconnected?
5,my car is the 2021 MG ZST sst first it did not work i contacted the buyer who was quick in reply. i updated the dongle following the instructions and it worked! have used for coupdle days now so far satisfied!
5,Delivery was fast. Adapter is real plug n play. It was up n running in 20 seconds.
2,I have been using this device for a while. Overall it performs very good. But the major problem is. It does not start CarPlay automatically. Every time I start my engine. I have to tap on the screen to start carplay. I tried to reach out the seller. But he did not respond.
5,This device works seemlessly in both 2017 Mazda CX5 and 2016 Mazda 3. Removes the need for those pesky wires having to be connected. I can get in the car with my phone in my pocket and it just connects after a few seconds.
5,Absolutely love the function no more cables hanging around and no hiccup so far
5,
5,Easy to set up and use right out of the box. Just plug into the USB port of a Apple Carplay enabled car and you're good to go.This gets rid of the annoying wire your phone needs to be connected to to use carplay. I love to use this on roadtrips or drives with friends now I can pass my phone around for my friends to select songs without them having to reach over to the front.As with a lot of blutetooth devices there can sometimes be a slight lag in sound when watching a video. Only noticeable if you're looking for it.
3,it works... if you want a wireless CarPlay that will be without fault then this is not for you. Ive used it for a couple weeks now and I have to say it does what it should with quarks. sometimes if someone calls you it will do half a ring then drop the call This happens again and again as they try to call you back - so annoying.Spotify or Apple Music do NOT automatically start playing (im not sure if thats even advertised for this).Drains your phone battery at twice the speed so you're actually going to want to plug it in anyways... not through the USB thats built into this unit because THERE IS NONE.overall - meh. solves the issue I had of plugging in my phone but created enough issues to make it just as not worth it.
5,Cet appareil est incroyable il s'installe en quelques secondes et le tout est prêt pour utilisation. Aucune configuration requise. Tout fonctionne parfaitement ; le GPS les appels téléphoniques etc. Un outil incontournable et très pratique pour rendre votre auto pratique. Je le recommande sans aucune hésitation.
1,Pay the extra money and get one that works
3,it is easy to install  just plug in  connect and go. Had smaller ones not to take much space but it is still decent size  Connectivity is not the best  loses connectivity 2-3 times in 2 hours drive  not so practical . sound delay is very annoying as well
4,It wouldn't connect in my $99 Amazon bought 7" Android/Apple aftermarket stereo. I don't think the USB port had enough power to use it.However I did test it in a 2018 Lincoln with Sync 3 and it connected just fine without any issues.Be aware that a cheaper head unit may not support it.
1,No audio on a Sony stereo.CarPlay works but there’s no audio.I have a Sony XAV-AX-3200
5,Fonctionne tres bien
5,I am really happy that these carplay adapters have really come down in price as they are the best. Setup was as easy as plugging this in and connecting to the bluetooth device. I did have some visual glitches when it was initially connecting however those quickly went away and haven't appeared since. There is also a Type C adapter included in case your car uses that connector for CarPlay.
2,Audio does not work at all when connected to wireless CarPlay. It doesn’t auto connect to my phone and CarPlay sometimes when the car is turned on forcing me to manually connect. Overall would not recommend.
1,doesnt work anymore after a month…
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Nice product
1,Does all it says it would SO FAR!! EXCEPT… it has made the incar call quality terrible!! I use apple car play a lot incar for work and this is a big issue for me!!
2,Je perds le signal régulièrement le signal et je dois dire que la qualité du son est saccadé.Un peu décevant.
2,Je perds le signal régulièrement le signal et je dois dire que la qualité du son est saccadé.Un peu décevant.
5,I was a little skeptical about this since I hadn’t seen a video review but what a great deal. Works better than other dongles at twice the price. So happy!!
5,The packaging was very simple and included a CarPlay adapter. A USB A to USB C adaptor is also included if your car has a USB C port.  Small and easy to read the manual made getting started quick and easy. In less than two minutes I had a Wireless CarPlay setup. All you need to do is plug your phone into the CarPlay USB port connect the device to your phone's Bluetooth and Wifi and you're ready to go. This is a one-time process so the next time you turn on the car while the phone is still inside it automatically reconnects to CarPlay.No more hanging cables and the compact size of the device leaves very little room in the center compartment. All of the apps were quite responsive. I have no issues using the voice command on my iPhone. If you are listening to a video there was a very slight acceptable latency which is kind of expected.Tip: As It attempts to establish a fresh carplay connection by cable when you attach the cord to charge your phone the car display will prompt you to initiate carplay from your phone. Press Cancel to stop any disruptions to your current wireless CarPlay connection.
4,I got this device as I was tired of always having to connect my iPhone to a cord in order to get my Apple CarPlay to work especially when I had wireless charging in my truck as connecting a wire defeats the purpose.This took a few seconds to pair with my iPhone and admittedly isn’t always the quickest to reconnect when I get into my truck but for the most part it acts just the same as plugging a wire into my iPhone.All the screens look the same the voice commands are the same everything is the same……with the exception of the really occasional dropping out.What I don’t like about this device (and I think it’s my trucks issues) is that it seems to always be on even when the truck is turned off.So what that means is if I’m close to my truck but I don’t have it running this dongle will see it and reconnect to my truck. When it does that (for whatever reason) it disconnects me from my wifi and flips me over to cell phone coverage.The other thing I’m not fond of is the length of cord that it comes with. As you can see from my pictures the cord doesn’t quite reach the cupholder but it also doesn’t hang down low enough to take the stress off of my USB port.Despite my few complaints I’m pretty impressed with this device and as mentioned love the fact that I don’t have to connect a cord each time I get inside my truck.So for that I’d rate it a comfortable 4.
5,This adapter worked well. After the initial setup I found that it worked well and the phone connects quite quickly. It introduced some minor audio lag compared to a wired connection when using spotify but really not a problem.
1,Doesn’t stay connected. Needs to be unplugged and re setup every time I get in the car. Takes up more time than plugging the phone in directly. Total waste of money. Will be returning it.
1,Made sure to read all the comments before purchasing of which the seller claims this works on all Mitsubishi models. It doesn’t. Mitsubishi Triton 2018 does not recognise the device and my iPhone 11 Pro does not detect Bluetooth either. Absolute rubbish
5,Works great in my MX30 fast responsive no lag connection
1,Got delivered fast  but doesn’t work on Infiniti waste of money
5,I like how compact it was easy to put in a small space in my vehicle great reception no hiccups whatsoever it works instantly when you start the engine clear graphics no problems at all does exactly what it states it would do great value for money definitely would recommend this product.

5,All good
2,I bought this for my 10th gen Accord. I can confirm it works… but it takes a solid 2 minutes for the dongle to wake up connect to your phone and start CarPlay. When it does connect it also doesn’t start automatically playing music.I ended up just returning it it’s far quicker to just plug my phone in when I hop in the car.
5,Akcord USB to Wireless CarPlay Adapter Apple CarPlay Dongle(update below)My car has CarPlay but I have to attach my phone via USB in order to use it.  Sure that charges the phone and gives me CarPlay but that's one more thing I have to do before I drive away aggravating considering the car also has a wireless charging tray.  I was excited to see the availability of a product like this.Setting up the device entailed plugging it into my car with the key turned on to provide accessory power. (I didn't start the engine)  Plugged in I went to Settings on my phone then Bluetooth Devices and found the adapter.  I added it and gave permissions as needed.  No problems encountered.  Very good!Integration is good.  The appearance of my CarPlay screen is a bit different.  I went into my CarPlay settings (in Settings) where the adapter shows as another device; from there I could configure the screen just as I would for any car on which CarPlay is used: App placement and background are now set to my preferences and things look good.  My apps are there and they work too.Setup was relatively easy and performance is good.  As such if you are in the same boat as I am I recommend giving the device a try!Update:I still like this device having used it for a few weeks now.  I see a range of reviews and my positive experience seems to be at odds so let me add some info.  Maybe it will help.- I have used the device successfully with a Kia Forte 2019 and 2021 Kia Soul. Both do not support wireless CarPlay.- I don't listen to songs off my phone or other music-related apps off my phone.  I do use maps look at traffic and I use Waze.  I also make phone calls and message while driving using CarPlay.  There is no difference between using CarPlay wired in directly via USB vs with the device.  No discernible lag.  Any random disconnects I get are due to the car: I know that because they happen with this device exactly the same as they have with the 6 cables I have tried.  It's the car.- Generally I now unplug the device from my car's USB port when I park my car: Yes the device remains powered while plugged in whether the car is on or off.  While it is a low power device and I'm not concerned about the car's battery what I am concerned about is my phone has tried to remain connected to the dongle even though I have left the car.  This isn't a problem if I walk out of range of the vehicle but if I'm withing BT range it has caused a problem while on a call.  Now I usually unplug the device when parking.- I had a problem once with my phone not connecting to the device: Anything I tried -- including cables -- didn't work and my only guess is there was an obstruction (debris) in the car's USB port.  Once cleared my phone reconnected to CarPlay both with USB cable as well as the dongle.  Now I am concerned about debris getting into the USB port: Maybe an on/off switch somewhere on the dongle would be helpful.- The device is sometimes slow to be recognized by the car (literally a few seconds at most) but if I ignore it it resolves itself quickly.  Otherwise "a watched pot never boils!"I hate to come across an apologist.  I also don't like to blame the user: If a good number of users have a problem with a product I have to wonder why and typically shy away.  In this case maybe the developer has to go back to the drawing board on this one... or maybe not.  (mine works with 2 cars after all)  The device works fine for me so far and it may work for you too.
4,Works but I have to disconnect it from socket if I am connecting a phone without carplay to car. It can't remain plugged in whilst phone is connected with regular bluetooth.
4,Here is the deal.  If you are one of those people who was over the moon when the "wired" apple carplay came out and your car supported it.  You loved having your maps messages and spotify accessible on your car display.  Well I was one and still am one of those people.The problem I was having was that the cables over time would go bad either due to constant plugging in and out or accidently stretching the cable while the boss in the passenger seat wants to look something up and then your car play stopped and you have to plug your cable in and get it all started back again.Well this device is a game changer (when it works lol).  I had no issues connecting this "Wireless CarPlay Adapter by Akcord" to my Honda Civic.  The sound is fine there is no real lag that would be considered as an issue.  The only thing I have noticed that it takes a good couple of minutes to auto-connect when you get in your car after the initial setup.  Also keep in mind that using this means your phone is not being charged so if you need to charge your phone in the car then you might as well just use the native "wired" carplay which will charge your phone and do carplay at the same time.  I also noticed some times it will drop the wireless connection and if that happens while driving you are stuck and have to wait when you are at a stop to reconnect.  This device also comes with an adapter for newer cars that have a USB-C connection.Personally I think $80 is a bit too much for something that just should work without issues. There is some serious room for improvement and the manufacturer needs to perform more real world use case scenarios and test the device over a longer period of time.
5,Working as well as advertised
