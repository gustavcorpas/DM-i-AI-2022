5,Love my printer.  No more expensive ink cartridges.  Easy to add the ink.  Can print hundreds of pages before you need ink.  Ink bottles are cheap.  Excellent print quality for black and white printing.I mainly use the printer to print email notices and documents.  So black and white printing is great.Color printing is not great.  But i have not done any follow up to see what adjustments i need to make.When I scanned the print quality was poor.  But I have not spent time looking at settings since I only scanned one time .
4,All name brand ink is over priced ALL including this. This ink is less over priced than most though so that is a good thing. These tanks also last a very long time many times longer than traditional refill types.The ink is good no better than some of the no name refills I have used in the past but no worse either. I need Ink in a hurry so this was it I didn't want to risk getting the wrong tank (has happened when ordering off brand refills before and didn't want to take the risk.
5,I HAVE BEEN USING THE EPSON BRAND INK FOR MY ECO-TANK ET-2720 MACHINE FOR 3 YEARS.THE BOTTLES ARE EASY TO USE WHEN REFILLING THE MACHINE.  THE BOTTLES LAST FOR MANYPAGES OF PRINTING OR COPYING.  BLACK INK IS MOST POPULAR FOR PRINTING WORDS.YELLOW INK HELPS COPY YELLOW HIGHLIGHTER PAGES.YOU CAN BUY INDIVIDUAL COLORS AT SMILE AMAZON.
5,For the first time in my life I don't have to weigh the cost of using my printer. I can print thousands (and thousands) of pages with a single ink refill ---- and the refill runs around $15.  So far paper in the biggest consumable expense. Print quality is great until the jets gets a little clogged which does occasionally happen but is fixable (just run a maintenance cycle). The ink bottles are "keyed" so you can't easily dump the wrong ink color in the wrong slot. It's literally a matter of taking off the lid unending the bottle and lining up the "key" with the correct tank letting the tank fill (it stops automatically when full) and putting the lid back on to store the rest of the ink for next time!
5,Thank God I bought this printer because these ink cartridges are a lifesaver they last for at least 6 months and I do a lot of printing.
5,Easy to use.  Pretty much foolproof.  Does NOT print the number of pages advertised.  However for school or light business use you cannot go wrong with this product or the associated printer.
5,I love my ecotank printer and I love that this ink was so cheap. It lasts for a while! I print alot! Definitely worth the money
5,Big props to Epson for finally making personal printer ink affordable. Seriously thank you! I love your printers and your ink. I don't print enough so I have to clean the heads often but it's still working great after a couple years.
5,Good product but still having issues with other color working
5,So easy to refill using these inks. Great value for the money.
5,Good value price & quality
5,Very satisfied! Will order again!
5,I get thousands of prints off of one fill.  It’s been months and I still have 90% of the ink that came with the Epson printer.And it’s inexpensive to replace ink.  I believe all colors are around $42.  But this gets you > 5-7k pages.  No more cartridges for me.
5,Yes it did install like it should and the printings are how they should be. So good item.
5,Love the cartridge free ink easy to fill printer!
5,I was down to the 2nd of the last line for my black ink. This was perfect price and nearly used almost all of the bottle! Wow! I love my printer and had it for a couple of years before I had to put new ink.I don't use this printer for Sublimation or Eco Solvent. I use it for daily documents or to print on cardstock for banners cake toppers etc or my most favorite printable htv!Yes I make shirts with this ink but you have to make sure to use printable htv! Do research!Very satisfied with my purchase.
5,This ink was just what i ordered. since it was HP ink it worked with out a skip.
5,So easy to install and refill. Quality is perfect - like fresh out of the box again
5,👨
5,The Epson eco-tank design is the absolute best printer I have ever owned. It makes ink cartridges obsolete! This design prints hundreds of pages before the ink tank levels start to go down. I will never again buy a printer that uses cartridges! Thank you Epson!
5,I really like these printers and the ink. It seems to last forever. We print color reports daily (about 30-50 pages a day) and this is the best value for the money.
5,This product has worked great and will last a long time
5,Buena inversión super fácil de instalar.
5,Easy to install happy with print jobs
5,Affordable and works! What more can you ask for
5,The price for the Printer and ink is reasonable the durability of the ink incredible and to top it all of the quality of the printing is just amazing.
5,Filled my printer. That’s all I needed from this.
5,Great price for a lot of printing.
5,If you're looking at this item you probably already own an Eco-tank printer so you already know that they can print even color pages at less than the cost of monochrome laser printer pages. You can't go wrong with these. The keyed bottle top makes sure you don't put it into the wrong well it also prevents spills and the volume of ink should last you a long time.While I am beyond my warranty period with Epson I still buy these official / authentic refill packs. They do a fantastic job at a fantastic price point so why would I want to risk anything else?
5,Never had a problem with my Epson Eco-Tank printer using Epson's ink.  This ink is pretty economical for someone printing mostly word processing and documents.  Have use Epson printers for years before the Eco-Tank printer and was constantly cleaning the heads when using after market ink.
5,Love my printer and how easy it is to replace the ink . Great investment.
5,This works perfectly with my ecotank printer. I have had the thing for over a year and have just now needed to add black ink. Go for it!
5,Exactly what I needed for my printer. Easy to insert and prints as expected.
5,Simple to use and long lasting. This printer with refillable ink tanks is a real money saver
4,This is an affordable ink refill for your Epson Eco Tank printer. It is more than the tank capacity so you have a little leftover. The ink lasts through many pages so it is worth the cost.
5,Product great but took over a week to get it. Good thing I ordered it ahead of time.
5,Longer lasting easier to use. Great printer and ink.
5,I love this printer! Excellent print quality super economical very very easy to refill tanks. Love it love it love it!!
5,Product as described will buy again.  Thank you!
5,Love the price ease of use and ready availability of these inks.  I'm saving hundreds as I print a lot and cartridges are SO expensive!
5,Best Ink replacement capability and the easiest to use.The printer is the best I have ever owned...clear color and BW copies. Ink wells are easy to see fill level. The replacement or refill of ink is the easiest to use
5,Excelente calidad de impresión
5,very good
5,Original quality genuine ink.
5,I love my Eco Tank printer! Ink is cheap ink is super easy to install and t lasts a long time. I was able to print 2000 pages before I needed more black ink. This printer and ink are a must for homeschoolers and teachers!
5,Just a home Epson printer mostly my wife is print happy. Easy to load. After I ordered this plus a separate 3 color bottles I found another seller that can give you all four colors in one package black runs down the fastest but I like to keep all the ink wells topped off for my color printer. Thankfully Epson May loading this ink easy in their printer with the view window to see how much ink is left.
5,It works great - easy to fill with the bottle. And the price is competitive.
4,We debated about buying this printer and using ink that is refillable. But it's good. And way less expensive for ink!
5,It worked well
5,So glad I bought an eco-tank. I've had my eco-tank over six months and have only gone through about a quarter of the tank in black even after heavy use. My refill is just setting there on standby.
5,EcoTank and the Ink Bottles have been the best purchase for our home in years.  As an elementary teacher I print hundreds of pages at home in the evening and weekend and was forever refilling (messy!) or buying new ($$$) tanks for my old printer.  I had enough and bought the EcoTank system and it's been a lifesaver!  No more late night runs to the store to hope to find an extra tank or pre-buying a stock of 'just in case' ink.  The EcoTank and refills is a snap clean and simple and the way it should have been all along.  Can't recommend this system enough!
5,Very easy to use and the price is good.
5,Works perfect with my EPSON ECO TANK 2720. Super easy to refill and store.
5,This device is easy to use and greatly eliminates the messy job of refilling ink chambers. It is far more affordable than its predecessors.
5,item as advertised price is reasonable delivery prompt.
5,Everyone needs the black ink most and the size of this is perfect
5,we didnt need a new printer but I was tired of replaing the ink every few weeks.  BOught the Epson ET-2720 and love it.  We use it a lot and it prints beautifully . It came with ink. It is now 6 months and we ahvent had to change a cartridge once.  BOught a new black one just in case.  Love it love it love it.
5,I use more Black ink than color. It is easy to get and load as you need it.
5,There is absolutely nothing to dislike! I can't say anything about the ink without raving about the Epson workforce ET-2720 printer. Being a full time college student I burn through several reams of printer paper a month. When I had my HP printer that meant replacing expensive ink cartridges semi-monthly. I purchased the Epson ET-2720 in August and only have to top off the tanks every month. It is quick easy clean and saves me time and lots of money! I can't recommend more!
5,Like most major manufacturers Epson printers provide longer life with minimal problems when you use Genuine replacement ink.  My Eco-Tank Epson printer gets approximately 25% more life and better quality printing when using Epson replacement ink versus generic.  You DO pay more... but IMHO you get what you pay for in this instance.
5,The price is the greatest. Every time I order from Amazon every product arrives early and is always perfect. I would recommend always buying from amazon great pricing great product and always arrives on time.
5,So simple to use. No mess and no hassle. It takes seconds to refill. I have not had to refill my ink in almost 2 years and I use my printer on a regular basis. Another plus is the Price!!! No complaints.
5,I start use this ink in May 2021. But It still remain little less than a half!!Cost performance  is incredible!!
5,Quality Good Price
5,AS EXPECTED
5,Received quickly and in good condition.  Easy to use.
5,Works as described
5,Good price and I only needed 1 not all 4.
4,I don't seem to be getting a warning of when ink is low.  At least not a warning I am able to confirm the low ink.  A light on the container in the printer offers little relief.  I guess this not a criticism of the product here but of the printer itself.
5,Excelente rendimiento y calidad
5,Love this ink!!!!! Great value! Has lasted a whole year with moderate use!!
5,These bottles make it easy to fill your printer.  They plug in and stop filling when your printer is full.  No mess no drips no overfill.
5,The best inkjet printers on the market.  EASY use...  easy to refill up the ink and saving you a lot of $$$.  Get it!
5,This printer is so great!  Print quality is great and the ink lasts sooo long saving is so much money 👍
5,Great ink. Love my Epson printer and the refill. Do not love how much price has gone up since last refil. Close to $10!  Too much!
5,Great product for ecotank printers. Will get over a year out of one bottle of ink. Arrived quickly. Good price.
5,Good
5,I am completely happy with the ink. Outlasts HP by months and months!Only wished I had gone this route earlier!
5,Nothing like OEM and this is what I ordered  thanks
5,Fantastic value for the money
5,Plenty of ink.  Great quality.
5,Great Price Arrived on time. Wiil buy from this seller again.
5,Epson allows more copies for the price of ink of any printer I have owned and this was the best price I found for the ink. And it came ver y fast!
5,This bottle of ink lasts more than a cartridge and this is an affordable option plus there is less plastic. Refilling the ink on this printer is very easy.
5,alot better than what I used to buy
5,Easy to install and long lasting
5,This ink is use in the Epson ET 2720.  Product is economical
5,You open the bottle and connect it to the eco-tank printer ink slot. It drains into the black ink reservoir.I love that the tips for the ink refill bottles are cut so they only fit in the correct color reservoir!GENIUS! They made it me proof!
5,Love this productit’s so much easier to use than the cartridges. We use more black than others and have just replaced the printer do to price. I will never go back to the cartridges. Awesome printer and ink!!
5,I can print more pages with the ink bottle that I could with the ink cartridge.  Cheaper too.
5,I love the fact that I do not have to buy printer ink cartridges every other day!
5,The ink is so easy to fill. Love the printer and the refillable ink system.
5,Cost is either equal or less
5,use it in my printer
5,worked perfectly
5,Best printer I’ve ever owned! I can only imagine if I had gotten a business model! I’m a teacher and I run page after page of tests and notes and the ink level barely moves
5,I have ordered this twice to refill my Epson Eco tank. It is easy to use and the ink lasts a long time!
5,Works great
5,I just printed 300+ pages and the ink barely moved down the tank. I use it with my ET-2720 which I (mostly) love. I do need to put the flashlight function on the iPhone however to read the ink level.
5,Buena compra
5,This ink is wonderful.

4,Eco printer was best investments.

5,Fast delivery great.deal
5,I have saved so much money with this product
1,When I ordered ink refills for my Epson printer the 3-color 502 pack was offered with a black ink cartidge as a packaged deal. I unsuspectingly trusted that the two packages were compatible with the same printer. Why would you suggest a black ink cartridge that is incompatible with the color cartridges??? My window to return closed over a month ago and I am just realizing today that I need to refill the black in cartridge and now I don't have any ink to use. I consider this false advertising of a sort. I should have done more research. Don't let them fool you like they did me!
5,Worked great
5,Easy to replace. print quality was great
5,Large amount of ink for refill.
4,Used in Epson printer
5,Its Ink.
5,Great product
5,good value prints great
3,Againgreat ink.Easy to use.Just don't know why you have to buy the black ink separate.
1,My bad I know.  I didn't read all the words.  BUT I don't think a product should have such similar numbers so as to be easily confused.  I really need T502.  Now I have two T522 bottles and no way to use them and I didn't realize it until the "Return Window" had closed.
5,Love the echo printer
3,Returned  Does not fit
1,Easy to use
5,The ink for our Epson Eco Tank printer is so easy to refill and Amazon get it to us in a jiff as locally our Best Buy and other office supply stores are out of stock.
5,I've wanted to smash my Eco-Tank printer into dust a number of times but when it's working it really does use MINIMAL ink and these containers are so easy and cool to use I really want to congratulate the engineer that figured it out.If your Ecotank is malfunctioning on you be sure to look up your specific model and problem description on Google and YouTube; believe me SOMEbody else has had that problem and figured out a fix!
5,Fill as you will Epson Eco tank printers are the best on the Earth the secret to keeping them working well is to keep them all year long at office temperature 76 degrees Fahrenheit or above and then print something once a week to keep the jets from plugging up. You can fill just one color if needed and you can fill partial amount in the tanks and then keep the bottle for later I seal it in two zip lock bags until needed again.
5,The eco tank was the best printer I’ve ever had!  Bite the bullet and spend the money!  I’ve printed thousands of color documents and even more black and white!  I’ve had for almost 2 years and I just now bought my first black refill!  Not to mention the true Epson refill is only $13!  Sure beats $50 with other printers that print a small fraction of what this printer puts out!!!
5,I was hesitant when I bougth the printer that had inkwells instead of cartidages.... wow.... I wish I had got it sooner! No leaks easy to load and last forever.... I have gone through 4 large packs of paper and it is just at half way.  smooth printing does not gob up.... perfect!  Highly recommend
5,The ink tank printer is the greatest thing ever in home printing. The fact that I can just refill the printer instead of buying SUPER expensive replacement cartridges these ink wells are so much better. This is a great product and I’ll continue to buy it when needed.
5,While it is more expensive than third party inks you can’t go wrong with a bottle of OEM replacement ink
5,It does the job it is supposed to do and last a while
5,Prefect for my printer
5,Printing
5,Great ink and a great way to buy it!
5,Much cheaper than ink for some other printer
5,I loved  that printer
5,Works well for my Epson Ecotank.  Thanks.
5,Check your ink levels regularly people!Top off that printer ink and keep the counterfeit money rolling!!!
5,Easy to use highest quality great price!
5,Great refill for my Ecotank We love Epson
5,👍🏻

5,Absolutely 100% happy with this purchase. It took some time to be able to have it shipped to me but the stores were out so it was this or nothing anyway.

5,Great Printer Ink!

5,Great value for my money and it is so easy to refill ink in tank.
5,Print quality and easy use.
5,What can you say about black ink?  It's black ink by Epson so yes it's fine.  As far as economical & easy to install that's all a plus of my Epson Printer which I love!
5,This is a great deal for your eco printer
5,Easy to use and lots of prints.
5,Fast service great value.
5,Super easy to use with no messy cartridges to throw away.
5,No Brainer !!!
5,Great product
5,I needed to top up the black ink on my Epson ET-2720 after about 2 years of owning this printer.  This product met that requirement (after going through the maintenance prompts).  I really like not having to purchase ink cartridges as often as I used to.
4,Good Product
5,Exactly what I needed and fast delivery.
5,Liked everything  delivery product and what I expected
5,Parfait pour mon imprimante
5,Original stuff.
