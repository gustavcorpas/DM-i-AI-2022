5,This is a five star where the item. I never thought I would have or need it a spare charger. It ended up turning out to be way more than that. It’s gotten me out of a jam several times where I have lost or forgotten a cord to my laptops. One way to think about it is that this charger is five different chargers in one Due to the different tips that are included.
5,I lost my computer charger. Ordered and it was here next day. Something I didn't expect was extra plug sizes.  Not word I was looking for but nice to know I can use on other computers by changing out tip.
5,Okay
5,Came in fast and works pe
5,Arrived as expected and in good condition
5,Shipped & arrived quicklyPlugged right in & charged old laptop without any problems.
5,A must have. I’m so grateful it came with the multiple different connector sizes for your laptop due to me not being so sure. Thank god for previous review as well. Charges super fast. You will not be disappointed.
5,It works perfectly.
5,This was what I was looking for to replace a cheap cord we bought for my laptop that some how didn't come with one this fit great.
3,The last charger I had for my laptop bent badly and I needed a new one- After getting this as a replacement I have mixed feelings for it. I got this specifically because I didn't know the size my computer needed. It charges okay but not perfectly. I have to get the cord in the right angle so it actually charges. I haven't had this for more then a couple months and I am now getting a new charger that doesn't have extra attachments so it can actually do its job properly. This helped me figure out what the right size was and was a do-able charger for the time being but I will only use it again as an emergency backup charger. It's not worth being my main one now.
4,Don't have a problem with it right now. I like the different sizes are convenient for other electronics I have.
5,Ordered this for my computer because one of my dog's chewed up the one that came w/ it. It does the job but it isn't the best fit. Not putting down the seller @ all. Their might have been one I could have ordered that would work better. I just order the first one I saw.
5,I like it very much!
4,Works just fine.
5,Need it for travel.  It’s easy to pack. Light weight.
5,This was a purchase for my wife’s Asus laptop during a recent move her original charger was misplaced and she needed her laptop to complete some work so we decided to purchase this one the charger works perfect for her Asus laptop.
5,Has a choice of plugs for whatever fit needed. My computer is a bit old but there was an adapter that fits. Thanks
4,The product works for Asus q405u.  Price was good.  Item shipped quickly received next day.
4,It has several adapters and it had the one I needed but after unplugging it a couple times (it's supposed to be portable) the connection is now loose and if it's not completely stable while in use it jumps back and forth between charging and battery.
5,I was happy to see my ASUS model listed. The cord and choices of adaptors were reassuring more so after  confirming the adaptor I needed. Contrary to some reviewers I found the fit to be quite snug and had no issues with noncontinuous charging. Unfortunately I fried my laptop shortly after receiving this component but that had nothing to do with the adaptor itself. Take the time to read through the compatible laptops. It took a few minutes but sure enough my model was listed. The models are largely in chronological and alphabetical order. If you're debating especially since it's at its lowest price now do not hesitate to buy it. Highly recommended.
5,To charge my computer and it works.
4,Good value for money
4,It's light and compact
5,Great product and fast shipping. Bought two so far very pleased.
4,I love that it had multiple adaptors depending on your laptop. My only complaint is that the cord is shorter than the original charging cable that came with my laptop. If the cord were longer it would be perfect.
5,My sister had an old surface pro that she wasn't using. I grabbed it from her but the charging cable wasn't charging it. It was relatively new as well so I didn't think that was the problem. Regardless go with the cheapest fix first yeah? New charging cable worked. Charged up the surface pro and the length of the cable has allowed me to put it in tablet mode on a tablet stand and use it for streaming my music to wireless devices throughout my living room. Pretty awesome.
4,Part is not a physical match to the original but works well.
4,The laptop model I have is what’s in the title for this charger and yet it struggles just a little to fit. But it works at the end of the day so I don’t mind.
3,I used this charger for a few months and it worked fine.  All of a sudden a couple of weeks ago I plugged it in and suddenly the screen went black and it was dead. Could not get it to turn back on.  Sent it off for repair and the motherboard was fried.  Got it back fixed had ordered another one of this same charger and plugged it in to charge and same exact thing - black screen dead.  Sent off again today for repair.  I think that the charger is too high voltage/amperage(?) for my ASUS laptop. I'm ordering a genuine ASUS charger now.
5,It was plug and play. The interchangeable head fits tightly which was my biggest worry is losing that. It works fine with the laptop. Runs a little hot when fully charging though.
