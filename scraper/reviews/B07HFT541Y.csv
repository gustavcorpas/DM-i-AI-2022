5,Top rated XQD card as advertised! Works perfectly in my Nikon D850!
5,I shoot a lot of 4k video at dance competitions. The worse feeling is your add showing it’s full and being just last midpoint at an event. My previous card was a 120g. Not enough. Now I purchased the 240g and it’s definitely worth it for my peace of mind. You can never go back and recreate a moment in time. This was a good buy for me.
5,Me encanto
5,Exactly what I needed for my professional photography business
5,I paired one of these with a Nikon D850 nearly 4 years ago and have run tens of thousands of images through it without  a single problem. I really appreciate the speed when photographing birds in flight using Continuous High shutter setting and 14 bit Raw image output. I just purchased a second one for a long trip where I expect to shoot lots of photos and need the extra capacity a second high speed memory card gives me. I also appreciate the speed of offloading images to my PC.
5,This is the second one I’ve purchased for my camera. The card holds a great amount of pictures and is necessary for the large format files of the D850. The card allows for fast downloads. I haven’t had any issue with these cards.
5,The Sony  XQD card is fast and robust. I don’t worry that the memory card is going to give me a problem. I have bought many of these exact cards and they have never let me down. Yes prices have increased but that is due to inflation.I don’t hesitate for a second in recommending the Sony XQD memory card.
5,It arrived on time. I read reviews and made comparisons. I concluded this was the optimal purchase. I am at best an amateur photographer and I'll get around to reading the camera manual about how to use this card.
5,Purchased this from Focus Camera. The first one was lost in the mail. I informed them what happened and they immediately sent me another one!! Great seller. I would buy from them again in a heart beat!! And the XQD card by Sony is great!
5,These are super fast chips.
5,Lo que buscaba buen almacenamiento y rápida.
5,In Nikon digital camera seems to work ok.
5,Mainly for my Z7II nikon camera this product is at the top of my list of image storage devices.
4,I purchased the Sony 128 GB XQD card and didn't get a chance to use it until about 1 1/2 months later. It works in the camera but I cannot download the pictures to my Mac. The Mac doesn't recognize the card. I have a 64GB Sony XQD card and it recognizes it fine. I've tried it on both my iMac and my wife's iMac. Both 64GB cards are recognized but the 128 GB card is not. I've even downloaded some XQD card reader software from Sony but it still doesn't work. And since it's over a month old I cannot return it. Had I known that I'd have tried it earlier. I've formatted it in the camera (Nikon Z6) and I've taken two different sets of pictures formatting the card in the camera after each set but still no luck. I know it's not the card reader or USB port because the 64GB card is always read and yes I did try different ports directly on the computer. With an upcoming overseas trip I'm very disappointed in this card. Not sure if I need to purchase only 64GB cards from now on. Part two of this review. I changed my  Star rating from a 1 to a 4.  I found that using the cable and plugging my camera into my computer I can view the photos and delete them or save them to my library. So I’m thinking it might be the card reader that is having issues. Since I’m not sure that the card reader is reading the photos I’m hesitant to slam the card if it is indeed the card reader that is the problem.  I Purchased the card reader on Amazon because it had a four star rating.
5,Good service good product
4,The exterior of the XQD card is starting to fall apart after only 18 months of use. I tried contacting Sony no response. These have a 5 year warranty.
5,Performs as expected. Previous XQD card's frame (the section used to click card in place/press and remove) chipped and a piece broke off. I needed a new card quickly. This one arrived quickly intact.
5,Very happy with my cards. Now I have 2 a 120GB and 240GB. Use them a lot and they've been perfect.I will stick with these Sony J- series or the newer 'Tough' series which gets high ratings too.
5,Esta es la segunda tarjeta que compro después de 6 años imagínense la capacidad de trabajo y solo la compré para backup ni siquiera porque la otra que tengo se me haya dañado.
4,Works fine - hate how expensive these are.
5,My card corrupted with photos from a wedding I shot on it.  I lost everything on this card. Fortunately I had other cards.  It is less than six months old.For a $200 card I’m pretty upset.
5,Fast write/transfer speeds!  Perfect companion (well really THE ONLY COMPANION) for my Nikon Z6. Snag an XQD card reader if you don’t already have one.
5,Works well with Nikon Z6ii and can easily be read using device on my PC.
5,This is for my phaseone XF camera. It works perfectly
5,For sports or wildlife photography this card is perfect. Very fast and easy to upload to the computer. You do need a special adapter for the computer but it is worth it.
2,I love these cards and have been using them for years. The last card I bought from here arrived packaged as though it was brand new (which it was supposed to be!) and there were TONS of photos already on the card. So incredibly disappointed and will not be purchasing anymore memory cards through Amazon.
5,I didn't even know XQD cards existed before I upgraded from a D200 to a D500. This plus a large-capacity SD card means I can shoot until the cows come home and well into darkness. It's fast enough that I can rip off as many frames as I want on the high-speed setting without worrying about overrunning the buffer. Makes a perfect camera even more perfect.
4,They XQD  cards are running the same price wise. I do notice I able to download my images quicker . I may have more of a review in a few months. … then my review will be more concise.
5,Nikon D5 with dual QXD slots
5,velocidad insuperable sobre todo en aves donde las ráfagas son muy frecuentes y la tarjeta en una NIKON D850 se comporta de buena manera.
5,My Nikon D850 is my first camera with a XQD card slot.  The thought of it requiring a special card reader and the XQD cards being more expensive had me wishing for two SD Card slots at first.  After using it however I now find myself wishing it had two XQD slots.  These cards are fast!!!  Most notable when I put the card into the card reader and plug it into my computer.  SD cards are SLOW in comparison.  Very slow!  I'm definitely a convert!  Really cool and what a time saver.  I have a photography business and do very little video but I'm sure it will do a fine job there as well.
5,En Firmacion de video es excelente y rapidez.
5,First card I received was damaged my camera would not read it. I exchanged for a new one and it was delivered quickly and just in time for the wedding I needed it for. Recommend these cards I have four of them.
5,120GB es más para hacer videos no es tan necesario para fotos.El envío fue bastante rápido
5,I am using my 120 GB XQD card for my Nikon Z6 II and so far it has been as fast as advertised.  I will update this after some usage time but so far so good!
4,this is my second card it is just excellent and great quality
5,If your camera uses one of these you probably paid a lot of money for it. Sony makes several models of this memory card all with different amounts of storage and data transfer speeds. If your camera shoots in the 9 to 12 or more frames a second or takes 4K video you are in the right place. If you don't think you will your camera may work well with a card that utilizes a slower transfer rate or less memory. In either case it will cost you less. Take a moment and read your camera manual and make sure you understand the trade offs when you make your election. These cards a well made and built to take a liken and keep on clickin. This is the real deal so you can buy with confidence that it's not a knockoff... j
4,The Nikon D850 is a great camera there's no doubt about it but if you want to get the full use and range out of the item you definitely need to purchase at least one of the Sony professional X q.d.-G series cards simply there's no choice. I do hope in the future somebody else comes along and gives Sony a run for its money in a better price point then what we have now! This card works well actually very well indeed. I simply use it as my primary card because of its speed in processing. The other issue Sony is the only maker of the card reader also here again its price point is about three times as high as some of the other cards in different formats. So be prepared to spend the princely price if you want to use a full working range of this camera.
5,pleased with the price time it arrived and that is does what its supposed to!
5,Great price and shipping was fast!~ Thanks!
5,I can shoot an unlimited number of shots at 10fps( until the card is full ) with the Sony Professional XQD G series 120GB Memory Card. Amazing!!!!For a comparison I'm able to extend the shooting buffer in my Nikon D500 at 10fps from 29 16bit RAW shots to around 90 continuous frames with the Lexar Professional 2000x 128GB SDXC UHS-II Card. Not bad at all for a SDXC card.
5,The major selling point of this card is speed.  It will put away images from (for example) a Nikon D850 camera way faster than what you can achieve with an SD card and that's really the only reason to buy this card.  Sure it's overpriced but if you want the ability to shoot on continuous high without waiting for the camera to store the images before you can shoot again you pony up the bucks and get on with it.  In a year or two when micro-SD cards are twice the speed of this card (and the hardware to use that speed is available) this may be an obsolete technology but until then this is the gold standard.
5,I dont like the pricebut is very good.
5,If you’re new to XQD cards this is a proven memory card.
5,Works without problem.
5,This card is perfect for the Nikon D850 DSLR Camera.
5,I have a Nikon Z7 and needed a solid XQD card and this one delivers. A lot photographers are complaining that the Nikon Z7 doesn't have dual card slots but this card is reliable and handles raw files easily. These huge files download seamlessly in Lightroom and perfect photography work I do.
4,Works for now. See how long it will last. Hopefully CFExpress comes along soon enough. Personally I think its overpriced for it to be phased out later this year. The price did drop before I got it though went from $200 to $155. It not 120gig either its 101. Should be closer to 110. You have to understand the way marketing works and actually storage. Theres a formula for it and you can google it quite boring but the gist is that anything that states physical storage will be lower however this particular card is off more than it should be.
1,Only worked for 4 days. I downloaded photo through PC card reader placed back in Nikon D850 camera took one picture then received card read error.  Tried a second Nikon D500 camera body and also received the same error.  Placed back in PC card reader and after 2 or 3 minutes it was able to read but had errors reading and writing files.  Tried both camera body's again and they still gave the read error.  Also could not re-format because if the error.Tried to do an Amazon return it said there was an error and to contact support via phone or chat.  First time chat they said I had to do the return through the seller or through the manufacture.  Contacted seller via seller page and they said I needed to contact Amazon.  Started second chat session with Amazon and they said the same thing.  I pressed more that the Amazon website said I had another three weeks to do a return and they kept saying I needed to contact the manufacture.  They then tried on my behalf then call me to do a conference call with manufacture. Fine.  Few minutes later via same chat they said the manufacture is not accepting support calls and to contact them through their online support page.  I then pressed even harder that Amazon is supposed to accept returns through the return date. Finally they agreed and emailed me an RMA.
5,I usually go with smaller volume cards and a greater number but thought I would try the 120GB instead of the 64GB cards in the Nikon Z7.  So far albeit I've not really used the Z7 much (probably less than 300 clicks) I've not had an issue.  I've used the 64GB cards in the D850 under heavy usage 500 - 1000 clicks per week without issue and suspect the same with this capacity as well.
5,I have 10 of these cards and all work perfectly and are accurate with speed transfers. Only brand I truly trust.
5,I bought this for my Nikon Z 6 cameras and it has so far performed flawlessly. It has a sturdy feel to it and fast recording speeds.
5,As much as I’d like to transition to CFExpress cards these are working very well for me at about 1/3 the price.
5,I purchased the Sony Professional XQD G Series 64GB Memory Card for my Nikon 850 DSLR and have had no issues with it at all. It performs as designed and is my primary imaging card in a dual (XQD/ UHS-II SDXC SD) card camera body. The 4k video recording is stellar and the 440mbps capturing should make it future proof when 8k video recording makes it to consumer products. Be sure to download the complimentary Sony File Rescue Ver 3.3.0 Software too.
5,I recently left this XQD card in my shirt pocket. I washed and dried the shirt with my laundry and found the card sitting at the bottom of the dryer. To my surprise the card still worked and my data survived!
4,Got a new camera and needed to upgrade to this XQD card. It does what it says. Transfers are fast. The card is bigger than a standard SD card and 4 times as expensive. It's a shame there aren't more competitors in this field yet. This item is way overpriced. You then have to buy a special XQD Card Reader which is the same situation as this. They're overpriced sold out or cheap Chinese knockoffs.
5,Product seem fine but the price could be better.
5,Makes SD cards look like snails.FREAKING FFFFFAAAAAAAAAASSSSSTTTTTT!If your Nikon has a XQD slot and you’re debating whether to spend the extra bucks or just buy SD cards stop buy this card.If you don’t buy it today you’ll remember you read this when your buffer fills up and you miss the shot or buy it and watch yourself try in vain to outshoot this card. This is the card that’ll let you test the shutter actuation limits of your camera. 400+ megs per second....’nuff said. Good stuff.
5,Ordered for Nikon D850
4,My Sony Professional XQD G series 120GB Memory Card is an excellent purchase to be used with my Nikon Z7 camera and my only issue is the price. Regardless i definitely recommend its purchase for this usage.
4,XQD is pricey but Nikon forced my hand with the purchase of my Nikon D500. I had to get an XQD card to keep up with the D500's burst speeds. I gave 4 stars only because of the price. These will inevitably come down in price - it just hasn't happened yet.
5,These new memory cards for the mirror cameras are expensive yet this size was the best value I have found for this type of card.
4,Good quality product no issues with it. This is still the current standard hopefully replaced soon with CFexpress cards but until then this will need to do. Not the cheapest solution but en par with equally fast and high capacity SD cards per gigabyte. Works very well with my Nikon Z6 cameras.
5,XQD card works as expected. I think they are overpriced but happy with the quality.
5,Works great but get the highest capacity you can afford. 128G goes too fast.
5,These cards are expensive but it's worth the money.  I get quality pictures.
5,It worked!  I put it into the slot took pictures removed it loaded them onto my computer and all the pictures were there!Still camera's are now starting to switch.  Yay!  Hopefully they will all change to XQD - I've had too many problems with SD.  And hopefully they are more reliable. I like that they are bigger and thicker too. I don't like tiny little things I tend to lose them.
4,I have been using 7 XQD cards for almost a year. Luckily they all still work I hope they continue to work for a long time for this price.
5,Bought the XQD instead of opting for the CFexpress series.  No regrets in the XQD.  Very fast transfer speed of photos onto my iPad Pro model using the Sony XQD card reader.
2,My review is on the Sony XQD 120GB. I've tested this card out with my Nikon Z6 and it works perfectly the card read and writes extremely fast and also transfers incredibly fast.  Now for the worse part I know memory cards have a slightly lower storage capacity than advertised but if you look at my screenshot my PC is showing that the memory card has only 101GB total when the card is 120GB!! That is a 15.83% decrease in storage capacity!! I really hope this is a defect.If anyone else has this problem please post a review or if possible to comment on my review!UPDATE 12/3/2018: I just recieved a replacement from the seller and I can again confirm that the capacity is still much lower than advertised. The 120GB card shows up as 101GB. Not much I can do here since The only other option is to try out the one other brand "Delkin".UPDATE 12/27/2018:Guys seriously this 120GB is completely misleading I bought another one from Amazon with a newer manufacturer date and its still showing up as 101GB on both my PC and Mac.
4,The XQD cards are very expensive but they are my only choice for the Nikon Z series of cameras. The card works but I have no way of comparing its performance to that of a class 10 SD card. So if you need it then get it.
5,Na
5,Bought a Nikon D500 to replace my ageing D300. The D300 uses the older CF cards which I have plenty of and can use in my D700.The D500 and up series use the new XQD format. Bigger and faster. No complaints whatsoever. When I need more I will purchase another of this brand and size.
5,Great XQD card. I use it in my Nikon D500 as the main card with an SD card as overflow and it works great. I easily get 10 frames per second for 20 seconds with no buffering. If you need a fast XQD card this one will definitely work.
5,Works perfectly. They advertise that they are 240gb memory. QXD cards are different. 240 means total you get use of 200. Every xqd is like this. So when you order a 240 you get 200. 120 gets 100 etc etc etc.
5,I like the product for use in my camera. D 850
5,I have a Nikon D850 and a high-quality lenses so I need a good card to keep up. This card has never failed me and holds plenty of pictures on it. I've been using it on and off for 2-3 months now and haven't had to dump the memory card onto another hard drive yet. Great quality great storage space couldn't ask for more!
5,Trusted card
4,This thing is expensive so you’d think they’d send a nice protective case for it. Not at all. Works fine but come on guys just make a nice protective case standard for some  $200 storage.
5,I bit pricey but needed it took a while to get hear but still nothing wrong with it and came in good condition.
2,The card was great until I figured out the outer plastic was falling apart into my camera. I thought it was a camera problem and found out it was the memory card outer plastic breaking off and jamming the camera slot so the card won't go back in.
4,WAs exactly what I expected. The price was a little higher than I anticipated.
5,Excelente inversión po la calidad del producto.
5,These things are soooo expensive. Got the Nikon Z6 which requires it. 32Gb is plenty for me. Even if I needed more storage I would get another 32Gb. That way if one gets corrupted during a trip I have a backup. I've always done that with SD cards too. Better to go home with some shots than none at all.
4,Fastest card on the market! Uploads in seconds and have never seen my camera wait for a buffer.Only thing that's a drawback is that these cards are kinda fragile. And very expensive too!
5,This is an extremely fast memory card but are paying for that. As a normal consumer and my camera can only adapt to XQD card leave me no choice to purchase the expensive card. Hope the price will come down soon.
4,really had no choice due to their not many plays on a field that make this type of card.It's been holding up pretty well.the price I wish was a little cheaper but you have to get to keep up with technology.
5,Talk about surprise when I opened my new Z6 and there was no memory card (and these are very expensive compared to the SD cards I used in my D5600. )  But this is a decent price and even purchased one "used" and it works great too. I cannot answer if it's water resistant because I just don't know.
5,Great memory card
4,Good working card very expensive as sony became one of the only manufacturers of this format.Comparing this to any SSD of 120GB ($200 for the XQD $30 for 128GB SATA).
5,Works fine. I just wish these were less expensive.
2,The cards work... But for some reason this card doesn't hold as much footage as my other 128GB cards. It says it will hold 55 minutes of footage where my other cards hold 65 minutes of footage. Thats 15% less storage capacity than the other cards that are supposedly the same amount. Not sure how that's possible.
5,No surprises here. Writes fast no corruption issues or anything. Great cards. Would buy again.
4,dislikes none
4,I realize this card should cost more than the SD but I was a little shocked at the difference in price.
5,If you are doing wildlife sport photography as I do. Highly recommend them. May be bit pricey but well worth the investment. The latency on SD cards is a pain when shooting high volume and you can get the full potential out of your camera using them.
5,Using this as my primary storage in my Nikon D850. Very pleased with the performance so far.
5,Value for the money
4,The price of these needs to come down or cfast needs to get released.  I guarantee the cost of these are holding many back from getting a new camera.
5,I have a Nikon D850. This works well and saves images clearly and quickly
5,Value for money
5,A little pricey.  Very slow delivery to my home.  It could have been put in the US Mail and would have arrived more quickly.
5,Coming from SD cards before this the read/write speeds are incredible. I have never hit my Z6's buffer using this card and it's extremely durable and reliable.
5,Never had a problem with my card. Lots of space.
5,Expensive. Worth it.
1,I just loaded this card in my Nikon D850 and couldn't understand why the available picture count showed 77.  When I mounted the card to my laptop I found almost 100GB of wedding pictures and videos.  I was under the impression that I was purchasing a new card while in reality the card had obviously been used and returned.
4,Memory C performed excellent for this order. Got it fast. Needed this for the Nikon D500. It seems very fast within the camera however still won't get the card reader for a few more weeks so not sure yet whether this was a good decision by Nikon to incorporate this format.
5,Works as intended for my Nikon Z7
5,I bought these cards for my Nikon z6 and they are extremely fast. Downloading them onto my laptop is extremely quick and I really like these cards. The only thing I don't like is the price. They shouldn't cost so much.
5,This works great in my new Nikon Z6. Writes fast and doesn't hesitate. Holds over 5000 photos if shooting in regular mode.
5,good to work with quick item as described
5,Very fast write speed. They are pricey. They are less likely to fail than a SD card
5,I always wondered why you would need such a beast of memory. Then I purchased the Nikon D850 and it became self evident the right tool for the job.
5,Purchased for my Nikon D850.  Pricey yes but worth it.  Shooting Cross Country and Track runners I don't have time to worry about buffering when spraying a praying.  This card does the trick.
5,Card works well and does what I ask of it but this entire format is way too expensive $$$
2,Sony XQD more than other brands hides more gigabytes. In the 120 gig size expect to lose 10 or more gigs of storage. We are actually buying close to 100 gigs and not 120.
5,This XQD is worth the money if you are debating buying a camera that supports XQD format cards. Not only does this type of card read and write photos and videos fast but it keeps it going so you can keep up with the action like football or hockey.
5,Very fast delivery amazing product!Thank you!
5,High quality and efficient service.
5,I have 6 XQD cards from another brand that stopped making them. These are just as good but cost a bit more. Not a single problem so far.
5,Great SD card
5,Love this memory card definitely can tell it’s of high quality due to the way it’s made feel and how fast it operates.. lighting fast. Transfer your files and pics is incredible fast as well besides the price you won’t be disappointed.
5,Liked the fast speeds. Other reviewers said Sony is the only maker of these XQD G Series cards. Using it with a Nikon D850 I've yet to overload the buffering but have no need to do so. Nice to have the fast speeds and large capacity available
1,I've had 2 Sony XQD cards fail. I'm out $250 and have gone to a different brand. I sent one to Sony under warranty but it was promptly lost in the mail. Thanks FedEx! I bought another as backup and now my 120BG Sony XQD did the same thing "Cannot access this memory card. Insert another card".I had to send my Nikon Z6 into Nikon service because this is too much of a coincidence. They said there's nothing wrong with the camera so far but the 120GB Sony XQD is "write protected" and they can't access it to re-format.Nothing on the internet yet. Hopefully someone will solve this. But right now I have $250 worth of bricked cards and I can't trust my camera.  Where's the "write protection" being added?
3,I do not like these cards. Had to buy this stupid expensive bulky card because I bought the Z6. Only benefit is build quality honestly. My 80D is plenty fast with an U1 sd card. Love the Z6 but these overly priced cards are total BS.
5,it works as advertised.
4,Card works fine but the price on all these cards is offensive since there are no options.
5,I'm using this card with my Nikon Z6 for more than six month no problems at all i did order another that works as expected.
5,Very pricey but works great in my D500 & D850.
5,Works great fast shipping
5,Works as expected
5,I have 2 others and have not had an issue with them
5,XQD cards are the best!
5,I just bought these as my 64gb XQD card was irratic on my Nikon Z 6 (can’t read card messages). Thom recommended Sony 32gb for these mirrorless models. So far the cards tested well and appear to be very well made.
5,These Sony XQD cards do all that you might expect them to do. They're consistent in quality and although a little expensive they never seem to fail me.
5,Works great just so dang expensive.
5,I bought these instead of Lexar because the Lexar's seem to be made cheaply and the plastic is thing and breaks off.  Sony's seem better made quality.  They are also fast and hold many photos.  I shoot fast moving sports.
5,It fit my Nikon Mirrorless Camera well. It was easy to install and the quality of my photos were great.
5,these XQD cards are so much better than the standard SD cards. the are a lot faster and durable. its too bad that they are a bit pricey. but it will be worth it if the XQD card lasts for years.
3,So Nikon switched to this format which compelled my purchase. The card is fast but to my knowledge nothing else accepts these. You need an adapter and the cards themselves are hard to find at any conventional retailer. Lastly they are at least double the price of standard storage.
5,My first XQD card...and I love it! I haven't shot any video with it but I use it with my D500 to shoot wildlife stills. This thing is super fast! I don't know if I'll need another card but if I do I'm buying the same card again!
5,I was not sure if this G-series would work with my Nikon D4 camera.  It works! and cost less compared to my H-series at larger capacity.  Am glad I bought this one.
3,The card did not and/or card reader did not work the first time used but i gave it a second try and it now seems to be working. If it messes up again I will update this review. I tried to download to my PC into LR but there were problems with  reading the card. I now have it working correctly....at least i hope so.
5,Sony is the only one making these . I hate sony
5,Good small fast drive.  Handy for one off projects.
4,It's just pricey for what it is.  This is the best value on a $/GB basis but man Nikon screwed its photogs (esp D850 owners) by choosing a format with so few suppliers.
5,Great card for my Nikon D4S.
5,Least expensive card I found. It’s the real thing and works great in my camera.
4,Shame Sony is the only XQD game around right now - these cost more than they should.  That said they seem at least as fast as my older Lexar cards.
5,From the masterminds that invented CF cards comes the next lightning fast durable media required in 4k cameras. Get them now!
5,Super fast and vast storage esp when compared to SD
5,High quality expensive. Sure it lives up to the specs but it’s super expensive. Would be nice to get some competition  asking xqd cards so the consumer wouldn’t have to pay $130 for 64gb
5,Have had this for just a few months but really happy witt it. Fast transfer rate!
5,What I needed and the price is acceptable.
5,Excelente tal cual como lo muestren en venta muy contento con esta tarjeta
5,Thus far no problems writing to card via Nikon Z7 and reading from card to two different MacBooks (Air & Pro).Fast reads using MacBook Pro.
5,great card works perfectly as it should super fast 400mb/s it did great job with Nikon D850 but it's high price 64gb is average meet the most use however the raw file is about 50mb I loved is & happy with it.
5,I already had one of these cards and I bought this one for a back up. They work well and hold thousands of pictures.
5,Nice sturdy card!
4,Arrived on time as described and well packed.
5,I am still very new to this format but it worked great for the little bit of video I take with my Nikon D850.  The read and write is fast enough to keep up with 4K Video.
5,Very pleased with purchase
5,Still very expensive but there is no substitute for this type of card. Time will bring down price.
5,Product works as advertised! Quicker transfer rate than SD cards.
2,These cards are plenty fast and the price per GB has been coming down but they still haven't fixed the weak point in the design which is the paper-thin plastic over the contacts. Even with gentle use the casing inevitably cracks (replaced three of them under warranty so far) and the crack spreads to the rest of the housing. If a chunk breaks off in your camera or worse the card gets stuck that'd be an expensive repair and could sink your shoot.
5,Very durable and insanely fast! The price can be hard to justify but I can tell it’ll last a lot longer than any SD card in my life.
5,Perfect for my cameras
5,Really fast read/write times in my Nikon D850
1,I heard qxd cards were more reliable than sd cards so I invested in this one for my new mirrorless Nikon. I've only used it a handful of times and it's already corrupt with all of my personal and client images and video footage lost. For the price I'm extremely disappointed.
5,Too expensive but great for pics and video
3,As much as I like this card the cost is too high.
5,You get what you pay for. Extremely pricey however - fast reading card. Lots of storage. Perfect for my mirrorless Z7 Nikon. Highly recommended.
5,Works well in demanding applications.  Pricey but if you need this type of memory it is a good choice.  I use it in my Nikon D850 with good results.
5,Top of the line storage. Have never had one failI purchased it for back-up when on vacations.
5,Easy to use holds lots of pictures
5,Ease of use and quality of pics.
4,But they are expensive everywhere.  No great bargain here but convenient.
5,Reliable and fast. I have used one of these for 1.5 years now and had no problems.
5,Pro. Great product high quality very fastCon. Pricy
3,Sony makes quality items but in this case took advantage of the situation being for a time the only maker of XQD cards to jack the price way above what it sold for before.  This was an action I resent and will not buy from them again.
5,It came in with the correct package
5,I have used this or similar cards with my D850 for ALL of my photos.  ALWAYS works fast. Very reliable!  Will buy again!
5,I had no choice but to buy this for my Nikon D500. Works fine but it is very expensive.
5,Works great on my z6. But I don’t know if durable or water resistant yet probably not try those
5,So far it has met my needs
5,Solid product that works.
5,I needed this card for my Nikon Z 6 and it is send to me quick and good.
5,Not yet much experience with these cards but easy  and fast to export to computer and great photos quality.
2,Does not last long and isn’t very dependable  would need many if you plan to do a wedding or anything that lasts longer than an hour or two and is important .
5,This XQD drive is a soldier! Buy it. You’ll be happy that you did. ❤️
5,Perfect!
5,Sony quality at an affordable price
4,Expensive and the only option for my Z6
5,Excelente servicio y productos!
5,I bought a Nikon D500 that uses these XQD cards the card works perfectly. thanks!
5,Say what you will about pricing but these are solid memory cards and are insanely fast. Highly recommended.
5,Great card. Fast transfer rate.
5,Card is extremely durable and fast. I am very satisfied with these cards.
3,Read is no faster than around 280 mb/s and overall storage is only 101 GB
5,Value for the money? They are expensive but all QXD card are expensive.
5,As of this writing there are not many options but this works well in my Nikon Z6.
5,No issues at all!  Love the speed and durability
1,I would expect at the price paid that the card would not be previously used. I put it in my computer and it said that it showed up as " NIKON Z 6"I do not own a Nikon Z6 which means this card would have been used by another camera.
5,Sony's XQD & reader does the job fast
5,Great card! Writes super fast on my D500.  No problems at all.
5,Shipped and recieved in pretty decent time so far works great!
5,Quick in performance.quite expensive and I am not sure about the value for money.
5,Fully compatible with my Nikon D500
1,Purchased this card a week ago when I got my new Nikon D850. Took less than 50 test shots deleting the photos and reformatting the card once or twice. Now the card reports an error. Cannot reformat to remove the error. Card is a total loss. Now I have to go out and find one in a store for my photo session tomorrow. Hope I can find a different brand than Sony.[12 May 2019 UPDATE] I went to a local photography store and talked with one of the sales associates. He recommended the Delkin Devices XQD cards over the non-Sony manufactured Sony branded XQD cards. They are a bit more expensive but I had no issues with the card before during or after a client’s photo session.
5,Deberían bajarle el precio.
5,Works as expected. Came out to be ~109GB out of 120GB. Not too bad.
5,Works
3,Write 2GB File - 193 MB/secRead 2GB file 255MB/SecUsed H2testwLower speed than expected but better than SD by 2X at least
5,Extremely fast storage
5,Excellent
5,Unbeatable speed，Used for the first timeFeel good
5,Works as advertised with my Nikon z7.
5,Got this card for my nikon Z6. Pros: Robust construction fast. Cons: expensive.
5,Very fast !!  Works great !If I ever need a card with larger capacity Sony is the brand I will buy !
5,Like it much better than the SD card.
5,Works and works fast...  no issues  and no failures..
4,Worked just like a memory card should.
5,Great card and a must use for newer mirrorless cameras
4,Wish they weren't so pricey
2,After 6 months the card is no longer recognized by the computer. A similar card is. So not the card reader. Using in a Nikon Z7 which does still recognize the card. The only way to transfer images is over wireless which is really slow and means I have to leave the camera on. I’m not happy. I’ve never had a SD card die after such a short time. Especially given the outrageous price
5,Great card. As described. Fast shipping good packaging.
5,Very fast write speeds perfect for 4K video...
5,I use this card with my Nikon D500 when shooting 10fps pics... it has worked flawless and I'm very happy with the cards.
5,Going to Alaska will let you know.
5,Next generation
5,Product was exactly as described and works as expected
5,Well worth the money would recommend this product.
4,Fast but quite expecive.
5,Worked well. Fast light weight and easy to use.
5,Fast delivery Good product.Thanks alot. I like it.
5,So far so good
5,I'm really happy with this card! Very fast excellent quality and does the job! Recommend to everyone!
5,Sturdy and fast these should replace Compact Flash....hard to find right now though since Lexar disappeared.
5,Works as advertised.
5,XQD The Best cards on the market-- I have 7 of the XQD memorie cards!
5,Great Product Fast Delivery A++++!
5,Fast just not that much storage
5,Shipment is fast and the product is good.
5,A nice solid card. Amazingly fast
1,Lost an entire 2 weeks worth of vacation photos!  was able to view images via camera whilst shooting. Then got home and card "not readable" when attempting to download images  onto desktop.  Reinserted into my Nikon D850...thinking I could tranfer to sd card in camera. Error says xqd card needs formatted. No images available to view. Got online to research not an uncommon failure of this product to be unreadable. All attempts at recovering my images have failed!
5,I use this memory card in two sizes in my Nikon Z7 and Nikon D850.
5,RAS
5,Super fast super costly....get what you pay for.
3,Purchased a 120GB card after in-camera formatting only 101GB available.  Other than misleading marketing adverting and being overcharged - the card seems OK.
4,Good!
5,Excelente tarjeta full rápido
5,D 850 works great. Very fast uploading
5,Great cards. Use with Sony FS7.Never had a read/write error. Knock on wood.
5,Excellent Product and Vendor
5,Exactly as described
5,Perform as expected
5,Nice
5,Works well but expensive compared to SD.
5,Great. But expensive.
5,Fast only complaint I have is I should have bought more capacity to start with.
5,Nothing use for take still photos
5,No problems - works great
5,I have used this memory card on both a Nikon D5 and D500 fast and no problems.
5,Good quality eligible price
5,Works good.
5,Good value
4,If you shoot fast action and sports get this card if you only shoot slow moving objects and landscapes and have other card slots in your camera it is not needed..
5,Only used it once but it functions well.
5,Works great........and fast!
5,Good
5,It worked
2,I felt extorted on the price of this thing.  You just can't find many others out there and this price seems ridiculous to me for what it is.  Maybe I'm missing something about the complexity of manufacturing these things but this seems like pure supply and demand (which I do support btw) craziness.
5,Buen producto
5,Its a memory card and works. Not sure what else you can say
5,The performance is as expected when is being used with the SONY QDA-SB1 reader.
5,Very fast and expensive
5,Very good quality!
5,Great
1,Use Sony XQD XQD USB Adapter to test its speed on my PC over USB 3.1 port PCI express 3.0x4 SSD (3400MB/s Read 3200MB/s Write):this Sony XQD card actual read speed is 300MB/s actual write speed is 169MB/s which is far less than its claimed speed 440MB/s Read 400M/s Write.Tested on my Nikon D850 its buffer capactiy can reach less than half of Nikon claimed capacity on Sony XQD 64GB card.My card was bought from Adorma at about $150.
3,Way overpriced because Sony knows they are your only option
5,excellent performance
5,Very fast!
5,Fits my cameras well made
4,No problems so far.
5,Durable

5,fast write speeds
5,Great memory card no problems.
5,enable the full capability of the D500
5,Works like a charm
5,Super fast just not big enough.
1,I used this only a couple times but have had it over 30 days. Today I lost an entire shoot because it died. It will not format in the camera or the computer. $200 bucks gone at $100 per usage. No way to contact the manufacture so I guess I SOL and out $200. Try a different brand name this was a card I saved for a long time and now my money is gone.
5,Works well.
5,Great fast card!! Does the job very well.
5,Very fast awesome!!
5,must buy it!! for my D500!
5,Fast! So Far So Good!
5,Excellent

5,great product
5,Great product! A +++++++
5,performs as expected.  No issues.
1,After a few months of use the camera did not recognize files..I thought it was the camera. It was not. The XQD card worked for a few months and then showed some file and others were unable to open.
5,Fast card!!
5,amazing
5,Works perfectly in my D500.
5,very well
5,Great product.  Work well.
5,Perfect
5,Perfect!
5,Great
1,I purchased this card "new" when I received it my camera wouldn't read it. When I put it in my computer its permissions were set to read-only. Using some recovery software I found photos on the card.  I now have a card that doesn't work and out the $80 I paid for it.
2,This card misrepresents it’s size. It is barely more than a 100G card.
1,I have two drives 64GB and 120GB.This is the second time in 4 months that 120GB has suffered data corruption.Bad quality product... I have shelled out more money in data recovery than this product is worth :(
5,Though XQD cards are quite pricey compared to SD cards XQDs have up to 4 times faster write speeds which aids in freeing up camera buffers. Professional users rely on these cards for the extreme performance and reliability. This card has allows me to continue to work effortlessly without waiting for the camera to catch-up .
1,It is upsetting to spend $200 on something that doesn't last. My D500 "doesn't recognize" the card all of a sudden. I can't spend $400 to get ONE working card! I purchased the Sony Professional XQD G-Series 120GB Memory Card (QD-G120F). So frustrating.
1,Beyond disappointed.
1,There is something ion the card that is moving if I shake it gently. I can feel it when I remove it from my Nikon D4s- I can't seem to find a way replace this as it seems defective. My other cards have no 'moving parts'... I don't trust this card any longer and don't use it
1,New card failed in my Nikon D850 after one week.  Empty card read "Full" and didn't allow ay pictures to be taken.  Dead weight in one slot in my camera.  Not happy.  My first try with Sony product didn't go well.
1,The most overpriced item i have ever bought. Not worth the money I am unloading my Nikon Z6 and buying a Leica Not from Amazon
2,for Sony Cameras only...& shipper will not pay for return.
1,Only 84% of memory capacity
1,only 2-3 months of use and it stopped working completely false advertisement  causes a lot of frustration I dont recommend it.
1,I ordered and used one tone only after I downloaded the pictures never works again
1,Ordered a 64GB card... Received a 32GB card with a 64GB label.
5,Seen some reviews of this card here on Amazon (I bought mine from a camera retailer) I thought I'd weigh in.  While the cost of these cards is outlandish ($88 for 32gb) the speed is extremely good IMHO. No I have not clocked it down to the millisecond like some geek but I can tell you that it is noticeable when shooting raw on burst and when dumping the card down to the Mac.  Very noticeable compared to SD and CF cards I use.  As for longevity and reliability only time will tell.  I've had the card now since September and have shot few thousand images in all weather conditions and reformatted it many times.  No issues...yet.  So fingers crossed. maybe the issues only happen with the larger capacity cards but in reality as a photographer I don't condone using anything larger then a 32gb just for the reason that things do fail.  I don't want to lose any images but I'd rather loose 32gb then 120-512gb in on shot.  I just wish the Z6 came with dual slots like my D750.  While slower SD card it has the comfort of knowing I have two copies of every shot on separate cards. :)  If this fails me I'll update this review.
4,Sony XQD is essential for photographers like me who don't want their days disrupted because their memory card has maxed out; and for those rarer but crucial instances when it's important to capture images in motion (burst).  The XQD provides the level of performance to help me avoid disappointment that comes from missing the shot due to a technical issue.  (Tip: be certain to check that your camera is compatible before purchasing such as the Nikon D4 and D4S.)I like that the card is more rugged when compared with traditional cards. With my photographic data requirements growing exponentially the Sony XQD is simply indispensable to doing the job right.I highly recommend the Sony XQD to everyone.
4,While I don't really like new formats/replacing new setup compact flashes have been replaced by XQD.There are SD cards that are capable of write speeds as much as these; however it can't compete to these 400MB/sec when it comes to the read speeds.Sony is always a pioneer in new technologies. You do need a device that supports XQD and also a XQD card reader.These days 32 GB is bare minimum.
4,As others have noted its well below the "rated" capacity. My 64G card shows up as 56G.  I know they play a numbers game but even using their math it should show up at least as a 62G. Its all very misleading.The sad thing about this all is that this type of card will likely be short lived as some others have gone with the competing format Cfast. Its suppose to interchange but only IF your OEM maker gives you a software update. WIth Nikon we have only seen them update firmware for the Z6 and Z7. Those of us with D500's and such may be left out in the cold.
4,These are reliable cards and that's what it really comes down to when you are working on projects that matter.  I use these on my Sony Fs7 and have had zero problems including on some pretty large projects.Although they have come down in price for 32GB the current price is still pricey but I really don't want to risk a project by buying a knockoff.  I'll let my competition make that mistake!  Most of my cards are 64GB or 128GB but it's nice to have a smaller card to use for smaller projects.
4,This is a fast card for your higher end cameras.  These are great if you camera's support them. I use it in my higher end Nikon and compared to and SD card my wait time for the camera to write from buffer to card was decreased.  I did have to get a card reader to read the card into my pc but those are easy to get.  I recommend these if your camera supports them and shooting speed is important.
5,The XQD cards are similar to CF cards but can't be used in CF slots. Their advantage is that they offer extremely fast write speeds in equipment that supports them such as the high end Nikon cameras in which I tried this out. Shooting rapidly with the setting at RAW requires rapid write speeds to allow the camera to work at its maximum possible shooting speed. This is perfect for sports photographers and others who typically want as many photos as possible squeezed into a minimum possible time. The card fits and works as promised. Just make certain before your purchase that you are looking for an XQD card rather than a standard CF card.
5,These are not inexpensive cards but this was a great price for THIS card.  I have been using XQD since the Nikon Z7 was introduced and I really like the product.  I'm heading out in 2 days for Iceland Russia Poland Finland.  I'm afraid I might run out of room on my current card so I tapped Amazon for quick delivery and they had BY FAR the best price - by $50!
5,Sony originally designed the XQD standard along with SanDisk and Nikon. SanDisk decided not to develop XQD products yet and allow Sony to take the lead. Lexar joined in later. So right now there's just a choice between Sony and Lexar. Although it's more pricey I recommend this Sony G series because it has faster 400MB/s write speed vs the 150MB/s write speed on the cheaper M series card. Downloading photos to Adobe Lightroom is about 3x faster compared to the old CompactFlash cards.Buy this G series if you do a lot of continuous action shooting.
5,Some of today's fastest SD cards can be crazy fast but these are ludicrously fast.  It's a bit of a pain to need a new card type in my D500 to have a backup and get the full speed of the camera but it's totally worth it.  The buffer seems to go on forever (pretty sure it does with jpg and these) as data writes incredibly fast.  Likewise 4k is no issue.The card is built like a tank and I'm not anticipating any issues.  Should I encounter any an update will be posted.
5,Unless you are particularly tech savvy which I am not and engage in benchmarking for most of us hardware working well consists of putting something like a memory card into whatever device you are needing to use it for and then forgetting about it. If you never have to think about it it is doing its job. That is what happened here. I put it in my Nikon and forgot about it. It worked fine at all speed settings with great video in the end.
5,I use the 64gb version of this in my d500. It is fast there is no buffer. So if you find yourself hitting the buffer this card should be a major improvement.
5,Good SONY and good products! Thus far no problems writing to card via Sony α7M3 Fast reads using My PC.
5,The Sony Professional 32GB XQD card is exactly what you need for capturing high frame rate photos or shooting 4K video.A friend let me borrow his D5 for a few days and I was amazed how much faster it shot than my D600. Because XQD is so much faster I could shoot long bursts at full resolution and was pleased how fast the buffer cleared.This card does not come with a USB reader but they're available by themselves or as part of a bundle.
5,As fast as it gets!  Insanely expensive.
5,Great card fast and small.
5,Very fast - Sony Quality
5,If you need an XQD memory card for your particular application (high end DSLR camera etc) this is one of the best (and fastest) out there. Personally I'm not convinced that XQD is 'here to stay' and it still could go the way of betamax (equivalently fast SD cards were just announced recentl which will keep that format alive longer) but this card is working fine. I just wish it were a bit cheaper...
5,Blazing fast card! Works perfectly in my Nikon camera for stills and video and transferring the files to my Mac with a USB3 XQD reader is refreshingly fast. I'm surprised the market for these hasn't grown faster because they are so much better than CF cards.
5,Expensive but good.
1,Lost 64GB of very good photos I took on a trip to Zion NP that where there one minute while the card was in my Nikon D850 and literally gone the next. When I inserted the card into the Sony card reader (the one they push with this card) and into my computer for no apoarent reason it showed the card as being empty! Hmm I thought wtf is going on here? I immediately placed the card back into the camera only to see the "no photos on this file" message when I hit the photo review button! I played around with it trying everything I could think of for about an hour with no luck!! The disk never was wet It never was dropped or had any other thing happen that would warrant this thoe of failure! 99% of the time I back up all of my cards with an SDII card in the 2nd slot! The truth of the matter is I wound up staying an extra few days and was low on storage. I decided to just use my last 2 cards (1 of ea) separately and did not take the time to offload the images from the original cards I had in the camera and to use these individually. Keep in mind my first 3 DSLRs only used the cheaper SD cards so A. I hadnt accumulated many of the Sony XQD cards yet. B. In the hundreds of thousands of images I have taken using plain old SD cards that literally cost a fraction of what these Sony cards that are supposed to be so wonderful cost I have NEVER so much as had a glitch let alone total failure! ( 90% of which where Sandisk Extreme Pros) Needless to say I am extremely disappointed with this product! Im sure the manufacturer would try to talk circles around me and make me believe I did something wrong however that is not the case.. I am not new to this game! I have read about the recovery software an plan on trying to extract the lost files. Unfortunately if the cards are this poor I'm imagining the software is probably equally bad! These cards are the first piece of Sony photography equipment/accessory thatI I have used unfortunately I now have no faith in their product whatsoever! In the end I was stupid for not backing the card up im aware however there is no excuse for a 64 GB memory card that cost $140 to fail the first time its used! Chances are I will never recover these images but you can take it to the bank I have used my last Sony XQD memory card!!
5,I really wish this was the standard. I threw everything at the card and it never slowed down.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
5,I have been using this card with my Nikon D3400.  I've been able to take consecutive pictures with no issues in storage.  Overall a great card.
5,Great memory card. No issues
5,Fast reliable and error free use in my Panasonic G4 and GM5 including shooting 4K video.  Excellent choice for filmmakers and photographers.
5,Good solid card.  Happy with it in my Canon 5D Mark III.  No issues at all.
5,I lent this to a friend for his Nikon D500. He reports it works even better than his old Lexar. Good job Sony.
1,Why short us on 8GB!!! I'll stick to 64GB!!!
5,This card is amazingly fast and doesn't hesitate at all during the taking or storing of the picture.  It clicks quickly between pictures as well! It works awesome and my rapid shooting has never been so great.  Overall I am VERY pleased with the performance of this memory card in my D500
5,This is just like the XQD card that came with the camera seems to work fine.
5,Liked used many times. No moving parts.
5,Received the item on time to my surprise. The tracking didn't show arrival time. Great card.
5,It is what it is an XQD memory card. Shipping was very fast and arrived before the estimate. Very happy with this seller
5,I just love the spee of this card..
5,Fast and reliable.
5,As advertised
5,No problems delivered on time
5,I have to admit taking my D850 to an airshow and having the buffer be able to empty into the card without hesitation was great My camera sounded like a machine gun clicking off shots. Had a buddy get jelly on me with the rattling of the shutter. I have to say it's a great card they're just high for my taste. It would be a good value at about 70% of the price I paid. It's a fair market price though so I wouldn't hesitate.
5,Works as a memory card should and compared to retail store prices was a bit better in cost
5,Only card I have tried and it works well so no need to switch
5,Great XQD card!
5,This is the best one I ever use
5,Nothing to dislike. Very impressed with the speed in which it arrived. Great service.
5,Needed it fast for a wedding job!
5,Use this XQD card primarily for portraits and landscape photos. Have not tried it yet for videos.
4,I’ve been waiting until there was a sale to buy an extra one. It’s really expensive but it’s the only one for Nikon Z6. It took longer than I expected to be delivered but finally I received it.It works perfectly fine. It’s Sony .
5,I blanched a little bit when I saw the price tag on this card that I needed for memory on my Nikon D850 camera.  I had been shooting with the other SD card slot and it was acceptable but the performance for the XQM card is 1000 times better and the amount of storage on that car is significant.  If I break down the cost based on storage it’s not as overwhelming as it first felt.
5,The Tech Evolves and the Nikon D850Is no exception.I LOVE that when on an assignments  call for On The Fly images.The amount  of Storage carries throughout  the day.True there are few Options. But Sony designed this Tech.  YOU have a Camera that uses this ...BUY IT!
5,This is my favorite XQD card. I love the write speed and that I’m able to label them.
5,I shoot a lot of long bursts of uncompressed full-resolution RAW images with my D850 and these cards prevent the buffer from filling up too fast. Downloading images using an XQD reader is very fast at about 300 MB/s. My only complaint along with everyone else is the ridiculously high price.
5,This is so much faster than an SD card and it is a better design.  Unfortunately you'll need a new reader to user it.  You will only get maximum read when using a usb 3 or 3.1 port on a system fast enough to take the information in quick enough.  I just read in 600 MB of pictures and movies from my Z 7 on an Ubuntu desktop in about 2 seconds.  I couldn't believe it.  It feels more durable than an SD card too.I only care about write speeds when it is in my camera and so far so good.
5,I have x6 32GB x1 64GB and x1 128GB. 100% solid in my Nikon D5 and yes will buy more.
5,I just wish these things were less expensive but it's necessary to use with my camera so I bought it.  It's very sturdy and it really does impact the amount of pictures I can take at once.  Im getting shots I may have missed with another card.  I recommend it
5,Works in my Nikon Z6. Kind of expensive but you have to use these cards
5,Love it. Exactly what I was looking for.
5,No issues at all. Very satisfied with this!
5,Price comparable to other cards like this
5,Keeps up with a D850 at 7fps on 12 bit RAW.  It can take 50 MB files at 7 frames per second almost indefinitely.I don't like how expensive they are but that's the price for speed I guess.
4,Todo correcto según se indica
4,Todo correcto. De momento funciona muy bien
5,de momento bien la camara la reconoce y graba ok falta ver el comportamiento con el tiempo
5,Ottimo
4,This card (120gb) is great with my D850. It has a very fast read and write speed and is very reliable. The price is constantly jumping around almost every couple of days  on here going from as low as $200 - to a high of about $309 at the time of this review. My suggestion is to give it some time before you buy it as the price might go down and to get it closer to the lowest point which is the $200 mark.
4,La calidad de materiales es muy buena y son muy rapidas.Si comparo la calidad de materiales entre una SD y una XQD la XQD es mucho mejor siempre me he quejado que las SD son muy fragiles estas XQD son robustas y mucho mas duraderas.A pesar de ser una tecnologia de sony nikon y sandisk solo las produce sony y delkin otras marcas dejaron de producirlas (nikon y lexar).Es un teconologia aun es muy cara. Integrada solo en camaras Nikon y algunas videograbadoras sonySi solo tomas fotos por muy grandes que sean (48mpx)  no encontraras diferencia contra una SD muy rapida Esta ayuda en caso de video 4K pero es ilogico si tu modelo de camara incluye un slot sd y un xqd de cualquier manera tendra que escribir en los 2 al mismo tiempo asi es que el cuello de botella sera en la SD y no habra ventajas. Si solo escribes en el slot XQD si es mas rapido. Si eres fotografo creo que la real ventaja solo la verian los fotografos de deportes que toman fotografia en rafagas. . Espero que se comercialice mas para que bajen los precios pero si otras marcas no lo incluyen en sus camaras tambien corre el riesgo de desaparecer.
4,I bought this for my Nikon D850.  It is professional grade. The bottom is made of steel for insulation. It is expensive but reliable. If you are not a video shooter or not doing  continuous shooting at 9 frame per second you don't need it.  The SDXC UHS-2 is just as good for half the price.
4,Very fast and feels very durable! would give 4.5 stars (if 0.5 stars was possible). Loss of 0.5 stars for the fact that single files over 10GB were consider too large to be transported on to the card. My file might be unreasonablely large but knowing that limitation kinda deterred me from giving full points for this product. regardless it's lightning fast and amazing would highly recommend still.
5,Hasta que no incorporas una memoria XQD a la cámara no te das cuenta el cambio de la velocidad de la ráfaga en una D850. Ademas de ello los archivos RAW se transfieren con mucha velocidad a la Mac aún en la configuración de mayor peso. Es un complemento perfecto para explotar todo el potencial de la cámara vale cada peso.
4,Very satisfied with it...except of the price. That's why I gave it only 4 stars out of 5.
5,I just bought a Nikon Z6 camera.  the 32 gb XQD is plenty enough for my need as a macro-photographer.  Most of the time I shoot pictures in focus single or continuous.
5,The XQD provides the read/write speeds required for high resolution digital cameras.  Great product.
2,I bought 120GB card for my D850 unfortunately when I verified the card capacity in my laptop its showing only 100GB space. I paid 288CAD but only lost 20GB! Unacceptable. I understand there is some lost of space due to calculation difference between windows and manufacturer but which should not be 20GB space differences.
5,Works perfect on my D850 if only we could open up the raw files already camera has been in the works and on the market long enough  its getting a little lame ;-)
5,No review on performance needed.Great pricing and service.Boxing day sale helped but XQD still hold their price even after the release of the faster CF2 cards.
4,EN mi opinion es una tarjeta extraodinaria en sus capacidades sin embargo asi como tiene grandes capacidades es muy costosa... estaré pendiente de los nuevos formatos de tarjetas para una posible sustitución de las mismas
4,Funciona perfecto en mi Nikon Z6 la trasferencia de archivos a la PC o una SSD externa es genial.Le doy 4 por el precio espero que se hagan más populares para que bajen.
5,Sony es la única marca que encontré para este tipo de memoria.  Sin embargo Sony es una marca de calidad en lo que hace.  La memoria ha funcionado bien en la cámara en que la uso.
4,Es una tarjeta cara y por supuesto que espero que bajen en el futuro pero de que es calidad sin duda lo es
5,the 120 gb gives me about 1100 more shots in RAW Large and 1900 in RAW mediumcompare to the 64gb that give me about 700 in RAW L  and 1200 in RAW M with nikon Z7if it can help you decide between the 64 or 120 gb size !
5,Works as it should in my D850. Very fast. If your camera don't have a fast enough card then it can't reach its potential.
4,What can I say? Sony has the market cornered with these xqd cards. Yes they are good quality. Yes they are overpriced!
5,Una excelente memoria por su velocidad de escritura y lectura lo único malo es el costo ya que a diferencia de otras memorias como las sd cuesta casi 10 veces más. Aun así lo vale.
5,Muy bien ojalá sean mas populares para que bajen de precio. Genial en la Z6 y D500
5,Super fast card and I don't see myself ever filling it on a shoot or even a wedding.
5,Un producto de tecnología muy avanzada propio para las nuevas cámaras mirrorless
1,Card was corrupt getting format error!  Could not format card
5,Mi esposo es fotógrafo y está feliz con la tarjeta de memoria. Es RÁPIDA y no le frena el trabajo para poder tomar una foto tras otra.
5,Ok come da descrizione

5,Used on Panasonic S1. Very fast
5,Aucun problème elle est parfaite!
4,Good
5,I use this product for stack photography in RAW format meaning very large files and consequently you need a fast memory card and this one is really fast.
5,Card is super fast ad expected and the item was well described. On the top of that it was cheapest comparing all online shops.
5,Excelente compra. Muy recomendable a pesar del precio.
5,Works in my D500 camera.  Does what it is supposed to do.Meets my expectatations
1,Nunca lo recibí me cancelaron el pedido no supe porque
5,Muy funcional y de gran capacidad materiales de buen tacto y velocidad muy buena.
5,Todo excelente a llenarla de sesiones!
5,My girlfriend semi professional photographer loves how quick the card is
5,Needed a fast reading card for new camera body...this one did the trick at a decent price
5,Best xqd card on the market. Worth the price
4,Expensive but very fast card!
5,good transfer speeds
5,As expected
5,Llego a tiempo y cumple con lo que es...  pd nada es mas rapido que una xqd card..
4,Great R/W speeds good capacity & reliable.
5,Perfect
5,best product but expensive.
5,Gran velocidad y solidez de la tarjeta
5,Good packaging- solid performance
5,La mejor inversión hasta ahora. Usándola en mi nikon D850 la rapidez con la que reacciona la memoria en modo ráfaga es increíble.
4,Todo bien el producto llego en perfecto estado y funcionando al 100%

5,Ich habe die  Sony XQD  G Serie - 120 GB Karten bei AMAZON USA bestellt und inkl aller Kosten für knappe 169 € nach fünf Werktagen erhalten.Die 128 GB Karte zieht ja nun hier in D so langsam über die 300 € Marke und ist dazu noch kaum zu bekommen.Wo der Unterschied zwischen der 120 und der 128 GB Karte liegt ist nicht ganz zuverlässig zu ermitteln. Wie es scheint liegen die Unterschiede einzig in der Speicherkapazität der Chips von verschiedenen Vorlieferanten begründet.Geschwindigkeit oder Zuverlässigkeit scheinen sich nach den dürftigen Infos die ich gefunden habe nicht zu unterscheiden.Nicht falsch verstehen - auch ca. 170 € für eine 120GB Karte ist ein überaus stolzer wenn nicht überzogener Preis.Da der mir aber vorher bekannt war werte ich die Karte mit einem weinenden Auge NICHT wegen des Preises ab.Außerdem stecke ich die Karte in eine Nikon D850 - und die ist ja auch nicht billig. Und wer A sagt muss auch die B Kröte schlucken..Belohnt wird man allerdings auch mit einer überaus schnellen SpeicherkarteIch nutze jetzt normaler Weise diese 120 GB XQD Karte  für RAWsund diese:Lexar Professional 2000x SDXC UHS-II Karten 64GB  für JPEGs.JPGs dabei in maximaler AuflösungBei schneller Serie schafft die D850 ca 25 Fotos bevor sie mit dem Schreiben nicht mehr nachkommt und auf etwa 5 Bilder / Sekunde runterschaltet.Mit dieser Geschwindikkeit schiesst die Kamera dann weiter bis der Akku leer oder die Karten voll sind.Lupfe ich den Finger für ein Paar Sekunden (so fünf sechs Sekunden) schafft sie wieder ca 20 Fotos in schneller Serie....Da ja bekanntlich eine der wenigen "Schwächen" der D850 der für so eine Kamera recht kleine Buffer ist schließt die XQD Karte aber auch die UHS-II SDXC Karte  diese Lücke für mich überaus effektiv.Ich schieße nur selten Serien. Noch seltener schnelle Serien und bin daher mit der Geschwindigkeit und auch der Ausdauer mehr als zufrieden.Bemerkenswert ist auch noch folgendes. Wenn ich nur JPEG schieße und diese auf die XQD Karte schreiben lasse bricht die schnelle Serie nicht ein.  Nach über 150 Auslösungen habe ich den entsprechenden Test beendet.Klar - die JPEGs sind nur etwa halb so groß wie die RAW Dateien - aber dieses Tempo mit JPEG Dateien schafft die SDXC UHS-II Karte auch schon.Letztlich erscheint es mir daher so dass der "Flaschenhals" hier die D850 ist und nicht die Speicherkarten.Aber das ist Jammern auf 6 Sterne Niveau.  Wer eine noch schnellere Kamera als die D850 braucht der wird das schon selber wissen und auch bezahlen müssen.Die Karte wirkt jedenfalls deutlich robuster und stabiler als SD Karten - aber auch bei dutzenden SD Karten in allen möglichen Varianten hatte ich noch nie einen Defekt. Die Dinger sind irgendwie alle besser als z.B. USB Sticks von denen ich schon einige Leichen entsorgt habe. Während selbst alte 256 MB SD Karten und eine 8 MB CF Karte aus meinem Fundus noch einwandfrei arbeiten.Bei den XQD Karten kann ich natürlich noch nichts zur Haltbarkeit sagen....Bleibt nur zu hoffen dass die XQD Karten dann auch mal in zivile Preisregionen rutschen
5,fa il suo lavoro ottimamente
5,Fácil y rapida conectividad
4,Marca conosciuta rispetta la descrizione
5,La tengo desde hace 3 años y siempre me ha funcionado bien.
4,Achetée pour un Nikon Z6 qui n'est utilisé que pour de la photo (pas de vidéos) cette carte fonctionne parfaitement et rapidement. Les transferts sont super rapides. Rien à dire si ce n'est que c'est cher par rapport au format SD mais plus qualitatif aussi.
5,Cartão original Sony xqd.Bom preço.Não há mais nada a dizer.
5,Utilisé sur un boitier photo NIKON D5 ( DSLR ) ce boitier plein format dispose comme bon nombre d'appareil d'un bus informatique c'est-à-dire « de liaisons physiques pouvant être exploitées par plusieurs éléments matériels afin de communiquer.»Bien qu'il soit un boitier professionnelIl est alors difficile de juger " avec precision " d'un meileur :. ↳  Débits en lecture.  ↳  Et d'une Vitesse en écriture plus elevée comparativement aux cartes CF.  ☞  Toujours est-il qu'après essai ( professionnel sur un shooting sportif ) j'ai vraiment été surpris de son :  ⇨  Débits très élevés  ⇨  Et de ses capacités de stockage conséquentes.  ✺✺  Resultat :  ☞  Rapidité d'ecriture de mise en mémoire  ☞  Impression des photos d'une excellente qualité  ☞  Aucun delais d'attente meme sur des prises en rafale { aussi rapide que l'appareil de l'ordre de 10 photos par seconde }  ➢  Pour  ma  part cette  carte  me  convient « Parfaitement Bien.»Aucune déception bien au contraire dès l'installation de la carte XQD dans votre boitier n'oubliez pas un formatage et la voilà prête a être utilisée.Une seule petite critique restre son prixMais cette carte est assez nouvelle sur le marché espérant que ce format durera dans le temps ...Apres l'avoir testée elle est donc une carte que je conseil à mon regard dans un bon rapport " Qualité / Prix "  estimant qu'elle mérite ses 5 étoiles.
4,Va bene la differenza di solidità rispetto alle SD ma queste schede non giustifica un prezzo così alto. Prossime volte mi garderò bene da acquistare una fotocamera che monta solo questo tipo di scheda.
1,This card doesn't work with D 800. The is thicker then regular memory card. The money I spent was a waste. Very disappointed
5,Diese Sony G-Karte ist unglaublich schnell in allem beim Schreiben und Lesen. Ein Vergnügen mit meiner Systemkamera zu verwenden.
5,Per quanto mi risulta insolito dover utilizzare un formato specifico di scheda di memoria su una fotocamera digitale quando ormai sono abituato all'uso di SD da diversi anni trovo che queste XQD siano molto veloci in fase di scrittura e accesso e dopo alcuni mesi di utilizzo posso confermare che non hanno mai avuto alcun problema di cedimento rallentamento o perdita di dati o difficoltà nel loro accedervi.Ho comprato anche un lettore di schede specifico per questo formato sempre della Sony tuttavia avrei potuto tranquillamente scaricare le foto attraverso la porta usb C della fotocamera.Con file raw da circa 50 Mb Jpeg salvato contemporaneamente a circa 10-11 Mb e scheda nel formato 64 Gb ci stanno circa 500 foto abbondanti. A display spento o con i soli dati di scatto (quindi senza preview continua dello scatto) finirete prima la scheda della batteria per cui consiglio di acquistarne 2.
5,Nelle ultime reflex Nikon occupa uno dei due slot necessaria nelle serie mirrorless Z in quanto presente per ragioni di spazio un unico slot di memoria. Visti i requisiti di velocità richiesti per lo stoccaggio dei file sia fotografici che video l'XQD è all'altezza della situazione. Utilizzata sul campo risponde bene e non crea tempi di attesa per la memorizzazione dei dati anche ad alta velocità di scatto. Per la qualità sono molto soddisfatto. IL prezzo è alto e i produttori per il momento sono solo 2 si spera per il futuro una maggiore diffusione per poter avere prezzi migliori. ATTENZIONE: Amazon le propone a prezzi assolutamente vantaggiosi rispetto ai venditori tradizionali. La mia nota negativa sul prezzo è rivolta ai produttori. Qualità ai massimi livelli risponde perfettamente alle aspettative. E' la seconda che acquisto da Amazon.
5,Buscaba rapidez y fiabilidad la fiabilidad se verá con el tiempo pero en cuanto a la rapidez es bestial. Me ha sorprendido mucho
5,A cumplido sus funciones sin problema.
5,Was soll ich da groß bewerten. Die Karte funktioniert einwandfrei. Dass die XQD-Karten einfach noch viel zu teuer sind ist bekannt. Ob sich noch groß was ändern wird ist fraglich weil die Speicherkarten schlicht nicht zum Massengeschäft werden dürften.
5,Nessuna sorpresa. Un nome e una garanzia. Amazon come sempre preciso e puntuale.
5,Ich setze die Speicherkarte in meiner Nikon D850 ein. Die Performance ist besser als mit einer UDSC Speicherkarte
5,Top quality come atteso da Sony. Super veloce sulla mia Z6_II fino all’ultimo scatto
5,Muy bien aunque compre de segunda mano pero me ahorre dinero
4,Buena tarjeta pero muy cara y sin competencia. No hay alternativa.
4,Deze gekocht voor mijn Nikon D500. Ik vind het niet leuk dat camera fabrikanten om de haverklap met nieuwe memory cards afkomen. CF was zeer goed in mijn D300s en volgens sommigen zelfs kwalitatief de beste memory card ooit.SD doet het ook zeer goed in mijn D7200 maar toch vond Nikon het nodig om deze Sony XQD te implementeren.Misschien omdat ze sneller zijn dan de oude CF en toch sterker dan de SD ?Memory cards zijn echter in het begin altijd veel te duur en tegen dat ze ingeburgerd zijn en goedkoper worden verdwijnen ze alweer voor een nieuwe generatie.Al bij al werkt deze Sony XQD zeer goed en heb ik nog geen fouten ontdekt.Als ze binnenkort drastisch in prijs zakken koop ik waarschijnlijk een groter formaat dan 32 gb bij.
4,Son las tarjetas mas seguras tanto las Xqd como las compatibles CFExpress pero para haber salido las primeras hace mas de seis años siguen siendo demasiado caras y con pocas opciones de compra.
5,Niente da dire sulle performance ma il prezzo è decisamente alto anche a causa del monopolio di fatto di Sony. La scheda offre velocità da vendere come si nota bene nello scatto a raffica e scaricare gigabite di file RAW sul pc è veramente questione di poco. Insomma robustezza superiore alle SD e  prestazioni da urlo che ahimè si pagano profumatamente. Spedizione Amazon impeccabile e velocissima come sempre
4,Acquéreur depuis peu de l'excellent Nikon Z6 l'obligation m'est faites d'acquérir cette très cher carte XQD indispensable au bon fonctionnement de mon appareil photo. Evidemment elle est très performante offrant des vitesses d'écriture élevées à 440 Mo/s suffisantes pour la photo que je pratique. Depuis décembre 2019 un autre type de carte CF type B est également disponible pour cet appareil le prix étant légèrement moins onéreux. Outre les qualités indéniables ce cette carte XQD il est urgent que la concurrence propose ce matériel pour obtenir une diminution du tarif légèrement excessif.
4,Superbe qualité surtout avec le Nikon z6 ou d850 c'est parfait mais je trouve que ces cartes restent très chères
5,Excellent for Nikon  great for wildlife photography
4,Acquistata per la mia Nikon Z6 la scheda è velocissima sia nella raffica( il buffer di memoria si riempie in modo omogeneo) sia nello scaricare le immagini sul pc.Purtroppo queste schede hanno uno svantaggio ossia il prezzo secondo troppo eccessivo però sono davvero veloci ed affidabili.
4,très rapide en téléchargement sur PC mais trop chère
4,Ottime prestazioni (usata du Nikon Z6) un po' sproporzionato il rapporto qualità/prezzo. Attivata in tempi velocissimi.
5,rapidez
4,Very well made cards haven't used them yet. Very expensive.
4,Bought through Amazon warehouse for less than £60 with damaged packaging . So much better than the full price at over £100 . Have yet to use but cosmetically it looks fine and unused .
4,Good product but a lot costly..wish yhe cost reduces so that al lot of enthusiasts benefit
4,I purchased this for my D850 and the read and write times are PHENOMENAL. I need a few more 64GB cards for jobs I have coming up soon and this card has already exceeded expectations. For shooting in RAW you need a fast and reliable XQD card and this one certainly meets those requirements.Reliable Card and I hope it will last for many more photoshoots to come.
5,Bin mit der Karte sehr zufrieden. Sie ist sehr zuverlässig und schnell.1 Punkt stört mich jedoch: sie geht bei meiner Kamera (Nikon Z7) schwer heraus. Aber vielleicht liegt das auch an der Kamera.
5,Für meine Kamera ist es die günstigste Karte - wie haltbar sie auf Dauer ist weiss ich noch nicht - und grösser muss sie auch nicht sein - 32GB reicht mir!
5,It works like a beast on my Nikon D500. Sony Professional XQD G Series 64GB Memory Card (QDG64E/J) is the best XQD card for all high end cameras. Tried the burst mode on my Nikon D500 i.e. 200 shots in 20 sec with both RAW and JEPG.Still writes the image very fast and the 21st second your camera will be ready for next shot.Packing quality was good and delivered in time. I would recommend this card for all those who have dual card slots in their cameras.
4,Quelle rapidité !Installé sur un z6 absorbe bien les 120 FPS en 1080 p !Rafale photo RAW aussi :)Mais le prix faut que l’on m’explique !!
4,Très bon produit joli packaging.Vaut son prix.
3,Los precios son ridículos y absurdos... la tarjeta en sí está correcta pero por ese precio hay CFExpress de 1000 MB/s y tuve que comprar esta porque mi Nikon Z6 "requería" una XQD para actualizar desde la versión 2.0 a la 3.0 ya compatible con CFExpress. Tecnología a precio de sangre de unicornio.
4,Non ho testato a fondo la velocità della scheda ma sembra molto veloce perchè a 11fps il buffer della d4s non si satura nemmenoanche se per me è un aspetto marginale dato che non uso praticamente mai la raffica H...la scheda è robusta e sembra ben fatta ma onestamente sono ancora scettico rispetto alle CF in quanto a robustezza  e il costo è davvero spropositato a causa del monopolio di Sony..
4,Tutto nella norma
5,Resistenza veloce nel trasferimento foto e video.
5,Tutto come da descrizione l'oggetto nonostante usato ha condizioni pari al nuovo tempi di spedizioni rapidissimi e ottimo l'imballaggio
4,Cettte carte mémoire a des performances excellentes en lecture et ecriture. De ce fait les hautes rafales ou les videos 4k sont facilement sauvegardées. Du point vue technique c est 5/5 mais le rapport qualité coute un point  le standard xqd est breveté et aujourd' hui il ne reste plus de competition entre les fabricants... CF express on t attend... Fais vite stp
4,Convient parfaitement au D5 ou D850 sachant qu'actuellement Sony est le seul à proposer ce format de carte....La loi du marché fait que le prix est en hausse très sensible mais quand on n'a pas le choix ...... on n'aura pas 5 * à cause du prix justement ! Ah si: un autre regret: la garantie n'est pas illimitée comme chez d'autres marques; dommage à ce tarif !
5,prodotto veramante ottimo!! sony non delude mai... arrivato nei tempi. consiliato!!
4,QXD is fairly new to the market and I had trouble getting an alternative brand and Sony was the only one available at the time.  The market could do with a little more competition to bring the price down a little.The card does exactly what it's supposed to but at a cost.
5,Se siete capitati su questa scheda è perchè avete preso una mirrorless nikon z6 o z7. Ebbene con la z6 ci stanno circa 500 raw e 980 Jpg fine.La scheda è veramente veloce in lettura e scrittura vale i soldi che ci spendete su
4,Parfait. Fonctionnel.
5,A very fast card expensive though
4,da lässt sich Sony aber seinen Namen vergolden den echten Vorteil gegenüber SD Karten habe ich noch nicht entdeckt. Aber die Nikon D500 hat eben nun zwei Karten-Slots und warum auch immer ist einer als XQD realisiert. Warum ? SD Karten können das Selbe und sind bei gleicher Leistung viel günstiger. Vielleicht kann mir ja jemand erklären warum ich die toll finden soll ;)
5,Tres bonne carte XQD - 32Go
5,Rapidísimas que decir de esta tarjeta son lo mas rápido que vas a tener nunca en una cámara algo inigualable muy resistentes la envidia de cualquier cámara capacidad mas que suficiente para tirar miles de fotos. Funciona excelente con ráfagas y video todo un lujo
5,Scheda consegnata in tempi brevissimi ottimo prodotto ma la qualità vai paga anche se ancora troppo alto il prezzo secondo me. Xqd è una garanzia
5,Cumple con lo descrito.La tarjeta está perfecta para el uso que la quiero darfotos y video
5,Fair product at a realistic price. XQD cards are massively overpriced for their performance.These cards are much cheaper in Japan the price I got of £78.00 whilst still high is 30% less than U.K. usual.Manufacturers are just pricing for what they can get rather than completely pricing.  If it looks like a cartel...
5,Utilisez avec un D500 Nikon pour la réalisation de vidéos. Bon produit qui est rapide et de bonne capacité
5,Très bonne carte urlta rapide pour de la rafale a 14 i/sec
5,No quedaba otro remedio ya que la Z6 sólo admite está XQD. Y es cara.
5,I resisted buying XQD with my other cameras but decided to take the plunge due tot he high file sizes produced by my most recent camera body.  The card is very fast to write which is exactly what i need when working.  The lack of card reader choice on the market is a major negative however.  Currently copying onto a SD card to transfer the images not good workflow practice.
5,Utilisée sur une Nikon Z6. Rien à redire sinon que la carte est rapide. Directement formatée sur l’appareil photo. Se lit aussi facilement via un lecteur de carte adéquat sur le PC. A voir à l'usage la fiabilité. Le coût reste toutefois élevé même si c'est sur Amazon que je l'ai trouvée au meilleur prix.
4,Une carte tout à fait rapide et utilisant au mieux les capacités des reflex récents comme mon Nikon D850 à conjuguer avec une SD aussi rapide en norme UHS II sandisk extreme Pro ou une Sony (un peu plus chère)Un véritable investissement quand même au vu de son prix.
5,Presa per la Z6 non ha dato il minimo problema.Nettamente più veloce delle CF usate con la D800 non ho mai perso dati o visto rallentamenti.Peccato solo che il loro costo sia così più alto delle SD.
5,Me ha gustado por lo rápida que es. la volvería a comprar  es cara pero vale la pena comprarla. muy contento.
4,It is what it is and does what it should. WIsh there was more competition to make the price more reasonable. No problems with it to date.
5,Todo bien llegoy rápido. Buen articulo.
5,Der Preis ist Unverschämt aber so ist das immer mit neuen Speichermedien.Die Karte ist Schnell Robust und funktioniert einwandfrei.Datenrate scheint zu passen Kamera meckert nicht.
5,Reçu un colis impeccable matériel exactement comme je l'avais espéré. C'est du tout bon. Un très grand merci.Par contre vous nous pomper l'air avec un nombre de mots imposés.Le plus court c'est le mieux si vous voulez que les gens continuent à faire l'effort de remplir votre questionnaire!Partisan du moindre effort vous penser bien que j'ai fait un copier/coller!
5,Though I had no occasion yet to test its full speed it is said to allow 20 RAW images in a 45Mp camera in burst mode without  buffer overflow. That is awesome speed.
4,Schnell und stabil. Leider im Vergleich recht kostspielig.
5,As with all pro products this is a fantastic quality VERY fast card but the price is quite hefty. If you want Audi you have to pay for it or settle for Toyota instead. 8-)
5,Obviously the storage space is great.Specially if one is using a full-frame body and shooting in RAW.The greater  writing speed is a great help when shooting in continuous mode.Just wish it could be cheaper.
5,Bon produit sans problème et rapide.
4,Ottimo prodotto ma un po costosa e quindi una stella in meno!
4,Good product but far too expensive
5,Malgré un prix très élevé les cartes sont fiables à 100% seul point négatif le prix trop cher pour une carte mémoire.transfert rapide à recommander
5,Teuer aber leider geil. Die Bilder sind so schnell auf dem Rechner....Weiterhin im Dauerfeuer (Sportfotografie) unverzichtbar.
4,Cette carte de 64 GO est indispensable pour enregistrer les photos d'un boîtier de 45 millions de pixels qui produit donc des photos "lourdes" et  elle est tout à fait à la hauteur taille vitesse d'enregistrement restitution...
5,A++++
4,Queste schede sono davvero veloci e rispetto alle SD danno una sensazione di solidità superiore con la cover di metallo che copre la parte elettronica. Ma non posso dare 5 stelle per il costo a mio avviso esagerato.
5,QUando si parla di schede XQD le alternative sono veramente poche. Sony sono fra le migliori da poco sono uscite quelle della nikon che dovrebbero garantire le stesse prestazioni ma a costi più contenuti
5,Had no issues with the card  and works fine with my Z6 . Just wish they wasn’t so expensive.
5,Excellent avec mon Nikon D850
5,Good quality genuine brand product
5,ho comprato una Mirrorless Nikon Z6 e le uniche schede di memoria che utilizza sono queste! costosa ma consigliata
5,Una velocità pazzesca.. bella robusta!
5,Bought for use with my Nikon d850 i tried it last week for the first time and wow! It’s very robust & fast. Much better value all the others on sale.
5,lo que mas me gusta es la rapidez de esta tarjeta y lo que menos es que es un poco cara pero claro es una tarjeta de calidad
4,Die Speicherkarte ist sehr schnell leider überteuert.
5,La consegna è stata più rapida del previsto.Una SD XQD da 64 Gb originale arrivata perferfettamente chiusa.Da provare per chi ha fotocamere che montano questo tipo di schede.Costo elevato speriamo che in futuro si abbassano da prezzo.
5,Tutto bene tranne il prezzo!
5,En general muy buena calidad su precio sigue siendo elevado embalaje perfectamente sellado.
5,Indispensabile per archiviare
3,My Nikon Z6 only takes XQD cards unfortunately. SD would have been much better.
5,So weit ich das überblicken kann ist XQD die derzeit beste Speicherkarte auf dem Markt (Geschwindigkeit des Lesens und Schreibens). Sie ist allerdings nicht billig. Und sie kann von den herkömmlichen Hardware-Systemen nicht gelesen werden. Deshalb erfordert sie eine spezielle Hardware zum Lesen der Karte die wiederum auch nicht billig ist.
5,I was a little daunted by the price but this card is an absolute must for Nikon D850 users. It reads and writes phenomenally quickly. Hopefully other manufacturers will produce these cards since Lexar have stopped making them - some competition is needed to keep the prices sensible.
5,Lightening fast performance. Price is quite high though. Not very pocket friendly.
4,Alles ok
5,I am using it in a Nikon D500 and it’s lighting fast
5,Ottimo
5,Does what it says on the side of the box. Stores about 550 full res Raw files on my D850
5,Todo dentro de lo esperado
5,tutto senza problemi
5,Works perfectly with my D850. Transfer speeds are phenomenal. Clears the buffer on the camera very quickly. Transfer speeds to my Macbook Pro using the Sony MRWE90 BC1 XQD USB 3.0 Reader are great too.
4,Excellent carte memoire pour mon Nikon Z7. rapide fiable mais d'un prix assez élevée.Malheureusement pas beaucoup d'alternatives.
5,Scheda grandiosa. Il Prezzo è spropositato ma in giro costa ancor di più.
4,La memoria è veloce niente da dire non 5 stelle solo perchè  adesso come adesso che LEXAR non produce più memorie la sony non ha competitors per quanto riguarda questo tipo di memorie.
5,Description is incorrect card is actually 64GB although I notice that the usable capacity is slightly less than the old Lexar 64GB XQD (1.2k photos vs 1.3k on my D500)
5,Alles in Ordnung keine Beanstandungen!
5,Increíble la velocidad de escritura.En ráfaga no se detiene puedes quedarte con el dedo clavado en el disparador.
5,perfect product
3,Jo la vaig comprar per 139€ i no noto cap diferencia en la D500 respecte una SD de w180Mb/s de Transcent. La velocitat no arriba a la meitat que la xqd w400Mb/s però no notes cap diferència i costa menys de la meitat. Tampoc l'he portat al límit del buffer però no en penso comprar cap més. És una presa de pèl. El monopoli que exerceix Sony des que Lexar va deixar de produir-ne no té nom.
4,Produit tout à fait correct jusqu' au jour d' aujourd' hui  le temps permet mieux de savoir définir une qualité de produit de ce type
5,La card funziona ma è Sony e costa un botto. Ci mancherebbe altro. Prezzo comunque migliore che nei negozi. Consegna puntuale
4,Good but expensive!
5,Prodotto super usato su macchina fotografica consegnato come da accordi nei tempi stabiliti
5,Tutto
5,Ist sehr schnell nur der Preis ist sehr hoch.
5,L'unico problema è il prezzo. Decisamente costoso !Ottima la qualità .Efficiente nell'utilizzo si foto XQD
5,Works well so far no issues. Prompt delivery.
5,Sin problemas. Se ajusta a la información del vendedor. La estoy utilizando  en una cámara mirrorless y la velocidad de escritura es muy alta. La compraría otra vez.
5,Fonctionne parfaitement malgré un prix très élevé...Mais elle fait "le taff" c'est tout ce qu'on lui demande.
5,The read/write speed is amazing. I've been using this in my Nikon D850 . Excellent for 4K video
5,very quick delivery thanks
3,Ich hatte bei der ersten Anwendung leider sofort einen Fehler! Alles Fotos weg! Erst durch neu formatieren ließ sich dieser beheben.
4,Velocissime nel download dei dati con il lettore sony
5,la velocità
4,Bought for a Nikon D500
4,peccato solo che siano veramente TROPPO CARE !!!!! purtroppo al momento esistono solo le sony per il resto sono eccellenti.
4,rien a dire
5,Endlich ist die Speicherkarte in meiner Nikon D5 und alles ist gut! 5x schneller als meine SD Karte - von der Kamera auf meinem iMac. Mit der Lieferung gab es einige Probleme. Aufgefangen hat diesen Mangel der Kundenservice.
5,Buono
5,après avoir demandé par Mail à un site spécialisé  et reconnu en matériel photo si cette carte était excellente pour mon Nikon D850 à venir : la réponse a été de leur part: OUI donc je l'ai acheté
5,sind top. Schnelle Lieferung.
5,e' la mia prima xqd e la utilizzo su una nikonz7 velocissima la registrazione delle immagini e anche lo scarico una volta inserita nell'apposito adattatore originale sony consigliata
5,Looks like these cards are the new kid on the block as far as cards go  so I'm glad I've got mine...
5,Amazing speed and works best with my Nikon D500
5,Great values and taxes paid at checkout. No nasty surprises later.
4,Nice product
5,J'utilise cette carte pour mon Nikon D850. Elle est très rapide aussi bien en écriture qu'en lecture.J'en suis très satisfait.
5,c'est rapide mais chère trés chère. la concurrence n'est pas au rdv.Donc pas vraiment le choix
4,veloce
5,Montée sur d500 nikon pas de problème.
5,Lieferung und Funtkion einwandfrei.Nachteilig sind die hohen Kosten aber dafür kein Punkteabzug. Die Übertragungsgeschwindigkeit - bisher nur für Fotos verwendet - ist kein Thema.
5,extra
2,XQD-Speicherkarten von Sony sind zur Zeit sehr schwer zu bekommen und so war ich erfreut über die absolut schnelle Lieferung der zwei von mir bestellten 64 GB Speicherkarten (werden fälschlicherweise als 32 GB in der digitalen Rechnung ausgezeichnet zum Glück sind aber die richtigen Karten geliefert worden). Dass eine der beiden gelieferten originalen Verpackungen bereits geöffnet und leicht beschädigt war macht den Verkauf aus meiner Sicht allerdings unseriös.
5,Prodotto perfetto come da aspettative. Consegna rapidissima. Ottimo acquisto
4,Cumple las con las espectativas con mi cámara.
5,arrived 2 days early. superfast card. price wasn't too bad. now I can get some shooting done.

5,Uso esta tarjeta para la D4s NIKON y funciona perfectamente es veloz y de alta calidad.
5,Supporto molto caro ma che vale quello che costa. Per registrare filmati in 4K è l'ideale. Consigliata.
5,Das Produkt entspricht absolut meinen Wünschen.
5,Velocità stratosferica! La SD più performante in confronto sembra un floppy disc
5,Transfert très  très rapide sur l'ordi en USB 3Il faut cependant acquérir le lecteur SONY dédié au format XQDLes Gigaoctets ne posent plus de problème : un vrai plaisir
5,Pas de problème avec ce carte.  Un peut cher mais nécessaire pour avoir 2 cartes dans un Nikon D850
5,Excellent product works really well in the Nikon D500. Fantastic seller with super fast delivery
3,Sau schnell Sau teuer! Deshalb nur drei Sterne!!!!

2,LA TARJETA XQD DE SONY 32G CREO QUE NO REUNIA LAS CONDICIONES DE NUEVA.GRACIAS POR SU COLABORACIÓN.
5,Very good value
5,dommage qu'elle soit si chère j'espère que ce format ne sera pas abandonné...
5,Carte conforme. Produit original fonctionne parfaitement dans mon D850.Livré en 2j ouvrés dans son emballage d'origine scellé dans une enveloppe bulle dans une enveloppe carton. Indestructible!

5,Une carte XQD indispensable pour utiliser pleinement un boitier D500 . Grande capacité et transfert ultra  rapide. Un achat que l'on ne regrette pas...
5,pour camera professionnel donc adapté
5,Come da titolo
1,Write speeds are shockingly slow. Didnt realise this until my friend pointed it out that his 150mbp/s card wrote quicker! For the cost this is not acceptable!
5,Nice Product but import duty was there which made the price more.
5,LA SICUREZZA DI UNA SCHEDA XQD IO PENSO CHE NESSUNA SCHEDA TI DA UNA SICUREZZA DELLA XQD GRAZIE AL RIVENDITORE ONESTO SIA SUL PREZZO E ALTRO
5,Commande arrivée bien avant la date initialement indiquée...ce qui n'est pas le cas d'autres produits commandés en France. Excellent emballage. Je l'ai déjà utilisé et il me convient parfaitement.

3,Muy caro no este en concreto. Si no este tipo de tarjeta
