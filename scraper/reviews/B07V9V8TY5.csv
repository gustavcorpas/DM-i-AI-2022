5,Bought this for a trip I was taking on Spirit Airlines where you are charged for carry-ons but not personal items. Wanted something that opens up like a suitcase but wears like a backpack and meets the size limits for a Spirit personal item. This thing fits the bill perfectly. I was able to take a weekend's worth of clothing including flip-flops and a bathing suit a Surface Go laptop an 8" tablet a set of Bose noise cancelling headphones in their case a paperback book toiletry items and all chargers. The large packing cube is perfect for your dirty clothes the medium one take a set of shoes nicely and the small one is perfect for your chargers. Fully packed I was easily able to fit this in the Spirit item "personal item" sizer box that they have at the gates.Would highly recommend it paid for itself on the trip over (and then some) and was saving me money on the return flight.
5,While I have not used the backpack on a trip so I can't comment on durability and sturdiness I can say that the size structure and organization will be perfect as a carry-on for a long trip that includes local flights in small planes. And the price is perfectly reasonable especially since 3 divider bags are included.Additional information - as I was test-packing the bag I found that a zipper caught on the fabric because of the way in which it was sewn. I returned the backpack at no cost and received a new one in 3 days and it is perfect. I will be ordering a second one for my partner.
4,This travel bag fits comfortably in the overhead cabin but not so much underneath the seat. You won’t have much room for your feet so not recommended for long flights.  Lots of compartments and pockets.It’s very sturdy and the clasps keeps everything nice and tight. The optional backup straps are great but I don’t recommend wearing this travel bag as a backpack. It killed my back after a few hours and I barely had anything in there.
5,I am still traveling in FL and this bag/backpack is fabulous!  Used it as a carry-on out and will check as a bag to go back. Fits a lot in its compact space. My first time using the packing cubes and….OMG game changer.Love this and may buy a few as Christmas Gifts!
5,I’m headed overseas today for 5 days (2 of  which are travel) so I didn’t want the hassle of checking a bag. I’ve been looking into getting one of these travel backpacks after a friend told me about them but my last overseas trip was for 2 weeks so definitely needed a larger bag then. For this next trip I decided to go with this bag based on reviews and my needs.I was immediately skeptical upon opening the package. The bag looked way too small and I was convinced I’d need to return it but I kept the faith and opened the bag up completely. Wow was I certainly surprised at the roominess so decided to get on with the business of packing it!Here’s what’s in the main compartment of my bag after completely packing it:*A medium compression bag (not one included purchased separately on Amazon) filled with a dress two pants two tops pajamas a bathing suit 4 pair of underwear and 2 pairs of socks*A quart bag of liquid toiletries*A second separate bag for non-liquid toiletries*2 pairs of sandals*A hair flat iron*2 empty compression bags for the return trip*An empty duffle bag for checking on the way back with purchasesThe outer pocket holds my iPad a cable organizer case an international travel adapter a compact travel umbrella and masks.The side pocket holds an empty reusable water bottle.I plan to wear it as a backpack and stow it under the seat in front of me. I’ve put it on fully packed and its comfortable and not at all heavy or awkward.I’d say so far so good. I’m truly pleased with my purchase and will update after my trip with further thoughts.
5,Used this bag for a 3 week trip to Europe worked great! The 3 bags helped keep my clothes neat and less wrinkled. I was worried about durability but it held up. I used it as a backpack for a couple miles not super comfortable but fine.Well worth the money I spent!
5,got this for my trip to florida to fit under the airplane seat since i like to travel pretty light. no need to buy a carry on! this bag has nice features and plenty of room for my stuff. my 14” macbook fits nicely as well with room to spare in the pocket. i also like how theres a pocket for my water bottle. this bag opens just like a suit case which was exactly what i was looking for to maximize space + it comes with 3 different sized organizers. theres also a handle on the side so you can carry it like a duffel bag if you want. the back straps also can be tucked into a pocket and zipped up too which is pretty cool if you’re not wearing it like a backpack. the strap on the back to strap it to a suit case handle is also a nice touch to keep it in place if you’re traveling with a suitcase as well. have yet to test the durability but seems like a pretty solid bag for the price.
4,I just went on a week long vacation and used this backpack as my only luggage. I was able to fit in a week's worth of clothes toiletries 2 laptops (work (15") and personal (13")) and associated cords and chargers. The large flap on the front allowed quick access to the laptops for going through airport security. Even though this backpack was pretty full I was still able to place it under the seat.This was the first trip I took with it so I am not sure how well it will hold up with increased use but so far it has worked well. I am able to go on trips with just a single backpack instead of having a carry-on and a laptop bag.
4,Bought this for a long weekend trip as my "personal item" on a budget airline.  It does hold quite a lot and it fit under my seat.  Packing cubes were great.  I love that it opens/packs like a small suitcase.  The main compartment with compression straps is nearly perfect.  The laptop compartment is roomy and padded.  Shoulder straps are sturdy.  I like that they can be tucked away without wasting valuable packing space.Why only a 4 star rating?A.  The outside compression straps only compress the sides of the backpack.  You can't put anything thick like a toiletry bag or shoes in the top of the main compartment or in the laptop compartment because the side straps will not compress it down.  If the compression straps would wrap around the whole front it would make this backpack a BEAST.B.  The front pocket is too deep and not easy to access.  Everything slides to the bottom. I would suggest making 2 smaller pockets on the front to easily access a wallet phone glasses etc.C.  The velcro pocket in the laptop section is also too deep.  I would again suggest 2 smaller pockets.D.  Adding some support to the corners of the main compartment would be helpful.  Especially on the "bottom" when wearing as a backpack.  Everything inside tends to slide down. Had I needed to put this bag in the size checker it would not have fit.Overall this is a very good bag.  I will continue to use it.
5,I bought this so I’ll be able to fit everything for a 4-5 day trip and not have to check a back or even take a roller board.Can’t speak to durability yet because I’m using it for the first time but I’m very pleased with it so far.We’ll designed and seems sturdy including zippers.Really holds a lot.Front pockets are well designed.
4,I did not expect much but the bag exceeded my expectations especially for the price. Seems pretty durable and was comfortable for traveling by plane with two laptops in it.
5,I took this luggage backpack to Hawaii and I was shocked at just how much this bag can hold. It fit perfectly on top of my carry on. I am an habitual over packer and I was able to shove so much extra clothing in this bag along with my 12.9 inch ipad and all it's accessories. It seems amazing for everyday use as well not too bulky and doesn't stick out like crazy if you stuff it. Decent price for how sturdy it is 10/10 would recommend! So happy with my purchase! :)
5,It fits a lot of things inside it also fits under the airplane seat. I had to bring a control inside the size of a shoe box plus my clothes and shoes. I am glad I bought this bag.
5,Versatility pack a lot of clothes and accessories for travel. Great carry on bag.
5,Great for even a 10 day Europe trip. Plenty of room. The packing squares make all the difference
2,*Quick observations after full review if you're pressed for timeFull Review:  I decided to take a risk and purchase this backpack on a flash sale especially since it could be delivered on the same day in time for a trip. I was looking for something to replace my Swiss Army backpack which is still in superb condition but not big enough to fit all of my things and my wife's things for a weekend trip. This backpack seemed to be a great replacement for our individual backpacks and roller suitcase and I was looking forward to having to bring only one bag.  Unfortunately the product itself is a far cry from what is shown in its advertising. In its Amazon product page one sees [or at least I saw] a bag that appears to have good structural integrity [with the appearance of an internal shell or wire structure to keep it from deforming] durable build quality and a comfortable fit. This is not the case.  In actuality the bag did not meet my expectations on these points. It easily deforms the build quality is poor and despite repeated adjustments to the straps it was very uncomfortable. The seller boasts that the product has undergone many iterations of development and its centre of gravity was paid special attention. However after filling the bag with varying items of size and weight in different configurations [along with strap adjustments] it was still very uncomfortable. Specifically the top of the bag to the middle back did not stay level to my back leaving a large gap. In practice one would have to hunch to achieve contact with the bag along the length of one's back. This is due to how flimsy the material of the bag is which affects how easily it deforms.  As an aside I understand that marketing materials are at best deceptive and it's my fault that I did not do enough due diligence before purchasing the bag in my rush. I also acknowledge that looking over a disappointing product's advertising after purchase is likely to influence one's objectivity. Still I find it worth noting that the images of the backpack being worn appear to be photoshopped. Notice the image quality of the bag against the individuals wearing it and the confusing size disparity of the bags from picture to picture. It should not appear to be the same size on an individual clearly farther away from your perspective than on an individual much closer to you. This gives it the appearance in some pictures of being monstrously large and in others of being of a more reasonable size. This I did notice prior to purchasing but I should have thought more carefully because of it. The appearance of shoddy marketing should have given me pause.  I should note the positive qualities of this product. It is indeed very spacious and it would certainly fit all of my things and the missus' things as well for a short trip. Indeed if it was comfortable and built well it would be the ideal bag for trips and one I would not hesitate to recommend. Unfortunately this spaciousness is overshadowed by poor build quality all around. I perhaps took it for granted that it would be similar to my Swiss Army bag in quality but it was my fault that I was mesmerised by the seemingly outstanding consensus of reviews [despite knowing how the review industry is intentionally shrouded in gamesmanship] the appealing product descriptions and the cheap price. However I think most people would be as well. So hopefully this review can help you pause before purchasing this item.///Pros:- SpaciousCons:- Poor build quality [seams do not have much leeway very thin the material itself is flimsy]- Easily deforms because of said poor build quality- As a result of the aforementioned two points the bag's centre of gravity is very low making it uncomfortable to wear. This is a cardinal sin if you will for a backpack.
5,Love this backpack. It’s light durable and incredibly well designed. It fits so much more than my normal backpack because if the rectangular design.
4,This can absolutely be used as a personal item on airplanes. I was going to europe and needed an extra bag as I was already checking in a big luggage. I’m not a backpack type of person but this was comfortable and held a lot of stuff for me. I am small person so this bag was big enough but didn’t overwhelm me like some of the other bags. Even with it stuffed it slipped easily under the seats. The only reason I give it a 4 out of 5 is that within a week of using it some of the seams came undone in the inner zipper areas. It’s not a big deal but I just bought it so it shouldn’t be coming undone. Nonetheless so glad I got this!
4,I loved this item for its ease of carrying and how much I could fit in it.
5,We used to this bag on frontier airlines as a personal item and it was great. I was able to fit 7 outfits using the packing cubes provided. That’s all I needed could have fit even more. Recommend 100%.
