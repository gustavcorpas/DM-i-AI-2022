5,Need it for Work so I can Hold it with a good grip while using. Feels good
4,Pen holder magnetic holder is weak won't retain the pen if moved or tilted.  Other than that it looks good and sturdy.
4,I think this will work fine for some. But since I have two crazy young boys who like to fight over things I didn’t care to find out how the plastic frame that secures the ipad into the plastic shell would hold up in one of their tug of wars. I have Otter tablet covers that are similarly designed and are very difficult to free the tablet from. This one just seemed… too easy to remove with just one fingernail. And the soft silicon of this one pulled away too easily from the black frame for my liking. The Otter design feels like I have to rip out several fingernails just to loosen the plastic frame AND that is AFTER I’ve already lost several fingernails prying the firm silicon cover away from the plastic frame. Also I was really looking for a case that came with a clear plastic screen protector attached to the top frame and for some silly reason thought this one would have one. One thing I really liked about this one though is the spongy air pockets in the silicon. Seems like it would create a nice cushion of protection for the ipad if dropped. I had to go off Amazon to find what I was looking for but this is an affordable and decent alternative for individuals who will not potentially have someone playing tug of war with their ipad.
4,I love the shoulder strap palm strap kickstand and stylus cradle…The only thing I don’t love about the case is that the top cover seems to float a little loose in the corners
4,My son wanted one so I bought it for his birthday
4,Looks like it will do a good job of protecting my iPad from a fall.  I don’t want to test it though.  It seams to be well made but a bit heavy.  Good hand hold on the back that will rotate if needed.  Comes with a shoulder strap which I have not installed yet.  I don’t know if I will use it.  Stand pulls out from the back and will hold in landscape or portrait mode.  Data and charge connector is protected well until needed.  All buttons line up well with their counter button on the iPad.  The camera is protected by being recessed about a quarter of an inch from the back surface.  I gave it a four stars for the heaviness of it but if you want good protection it is not too bad of a trade off.
5,
3,Protection seems good and the stand works great but the outter rubber layer is not very sturdy or tight fitting. Can easily move out of alignment with the harder layer under it.
3,To bulky and heavy
5,Must satisfied with the product ideal for kids.
5,Very durable! Has straps so you can carry it. Easy to hold. We also put ours in a car stand and even with the case on it still fits. We love the case! Highly recommend
4,Pictures deceived me with the pen. Very tight fit but nice case and seems it can protect my ipad.
5,Works very well and helped to be able to carry it around and use when needed. Hands free carrying.
5,I use this for my Matterport Capture device and it makes the job a lot easier. Sturdy reliable and very functional.
4,Seems pretty sturdy. It was easy to install and fits well.
4,My iPad is an iPad Pro 2020 11”The installation was a tiny bit awkward but overall it was pretty quick. I will note that two of the corners are ever so slightly warped so that there is a slight gap between the case and the screen. It’s not an iPad safety issue but I’m going to have to be wary of random dirt or dust.The soft black backing is a dust/fur magnet but it doesn’t bother me too much because it’s easy to just swipe clean. I am a tiny bit surprised that the hard material is against the iPad and the soft material is on the outside…but I do still like the case.All of the buttons line up correctly and they are easy to press. The Apple Pencil (2nd) is easy to place and remove from the case and most importantly it can still charge. The kickstand works well and it rotates along with the hand strap so that it can face all four directions. There is no screen protection provided so I bought my own separately.I’m fairly satisfied with this case because the perks outweigh the downfalls by a good margin.
3,It’s a nice case that is durable but doesn’t properly fit the cheap plastic at the top won’t stay snapped together and I’m constantly having to put it back together daily
4,I had plans to attach it to the headrest for passengers in the back. Is is okay for just carrying the tablet. I found it easier to watch installation video. It is okay.
5,These are great. I buy these all the time.
3,Fragile and cheaply made
5,I haven't had any issues with this cover at all. It seems to work very well although I have not dropped my I pad pro. It looks good though. I think I'd buy it again. Perhaps I'll come back to update my review if I change my mind about it at some point. But So far so good.
4,Probably my favorite rubber on a case so far but it's not as tight and form fitting as it should be they should just adhere the rubber to the main backing imo.
5,
5,Got this because I was looking for a case with a handle and a built-in stand. This satisfies both. And it's got some protection from dropping. The only con is that it's a bit heavier than I wanted but it's as light as it can be for the protection you get in my opinion. Would definitely buy again!
5,I’ve had the case for a couple of weeks and it appears to be pretty sturdy. The rotating strap on the back makes it so comfortable to work just about anywhere.
4,Easy to install and use.
5,Thank you for the perfect case for my iPad.
5,Good product for the price.
5,Do the job great very comfortable
5,Falta cubrir la pantalla
5,Excelente para proteger el iPad. De buena calidad.
5,Really happy to have this cover on my iPad.  Glad I found it.  I find myself constantly using the handle on the back the kickstand and of course the pencil holder.  It came with a shoulder/neck strap which I have yet to use but I saw it featured on “Upload” streaming on Amazon.  Season two I think episode 6.
5,I love the handle that allows you to move the iPad without moving your hand!
4,Hard to close apps and swipe however great
5,Now this is very sturdy. Even if you drop the tablet this will protect it. Just don’t intentionally drop it. Joking aside this is like an armor. Very bulky sturdy if you use the tablet frequestly for work while on the go this is the best I found. Very durable convenient to use.
5,I like the strap on the back!
5,Easy to hold.
5,The best case I've ever had  and perfect if you're using your iPad for drawing.  It is so easy to hold and I love that the handle rotates so you don't have to reposition your hand as your turning the iPad.
5,The design made this easy to hold while at the game using the game day app.
3,Doesn’t come with a screen protector i thought It did but the case seems pretty good
5,Lo compre en diciembre y ahora mismo es mayo y el continúa como el primer día. Lo recomiendo al 100%
5,The case seems secure and well padded. The installation video in the product description above is very helpful. It installed in nothing flat and works with the Apple Pencil 2. Shows it is charging and percent charged. I actually like that there is NO screen protector build in. I use ESR's tempered glass and it works great. I had a built in screen protector with Otterbox Defender for Air 3 and it felt like cheap plastic.I am replacing an ESR iPad Pro Case with this case because I really didn't like the flap cover it had. This iPad is used outdoors a lot and using it with a cover flopping around seemed annoying and dangerous.All and all I really like this case. The insert showed that the case with have optional colors. That would be nice too.My iPad Pro 11 2021 is Model A2301  Wi-Fi + Cellular
4,Product was great but I ordered the wrong size.  It was fast and easy to return
4,Almost but not quite the snug fit I expected.  Good product for the price.  Certainly does the job.
5,Excelente calidad lo recomiendo perfectamente
5,It has worked out great for my business iPad I am in the whole industry and I am in and out of my truck all day long and I do drop my iPad every now and then. The case has really held up.
5,I love that it’s easy to hold and durability!!
4,It’s easy to hold and seems durable.
5,got this for my grandson it really work for him  he still have his table cause baby  it would be broke by nie
5,Love this case. It’s not too much bigger than the iPad itself. I like the carrying strap and the handle on the back.
4,Very good
5,Si nunca tienen que sacarlo de la funda es genial pero si son como yo que tienen que estarlo cambiando del estuche al teclado hay una pieza que es muy delicada y fácilmente se puede quebrar.
2,Case works overall frustrated that the back clip is broken. Have to prop it up on things now. Was a five star case til the back broke.
3,Easy to hold one handed but broke. I never ended up using the strap.
5,This very sturdy and easy to hold.....The pop out stand is a nice plus...
5,Easy to install and excellent comfortable shape its protected i pad more than i expected it's i pad perfectly and also comes with pencil holder perfect for kids.
4,Great case..I would rather it have a place for Pen that didn't charge all the time and maybe a more sturdy kick stand
5,This is a great case my daughter plays in the iPad all day and I live that it have that strap too awesome
2,The case cutouts do not align with the IPad Pro 11.  Received yesterday and returning tomorrow
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I have total control of the position of my tablet. Love it!!!. Never had any other case that works so well.
2,First the Velcro gets covered in stuff and makes the handle useless. Secondly one drop and my sons iPad Pro has dead pixels now. Also day 1 and my sons Apple Pencil fell out so that is another $100 loss.  Pretty unhappy. Doesn’t do much for protecting it.
5,This case provides excellent protection for the iPad. However it does not include a screen protector and it may be a little heavy. It does provide good overall protection.
3,Product broke after 2 months. Can't return it or even reach out to seller. Do NOT recommend.
5,Awesome af
5,Perfect for the new iPad my wife bought for me.
5,Very nice case took a little messing around to figure out how to properly put it on but all-in-all not to difficult. The little piece of rubber that covers the charger spot is kind of a pain but🤷‍♂️ other than that 👌
2,The Lever has broken that allows the iPad to freely stand.  The locking button on the system is difficult to reach.  After less than 3 months the bracket is broken.  I would not recommend this holder if you need for it to stand on its own.May 16 2022 - Wanted to add that if you plan to take the iPad out of the case and place it on any keyboard folio for editing releasing the pad is very difficult.  If you purchase this pad plan on purchasing a separate keyboard if you so choose.
5,I really need I love it good quality
5,This holder for my iPad Pro 11 fits perfectly and is super durable. Love that it’s easy to hold and carry with the strap. I love the hand held strap in the back that is fully adjustable and makes the pad easy to turn a full 180. Highly recommended!Oh and super fast shipping too!
5,Great Case. I bought one new and one used. Only problem with used is that it didn’t come with the body cross strap.
4,I like the protection but it’s so freakin hard to put on. You must be patient!
3,Would be perfect if it included a screen protector.There were not many options for iPad Pro with the tough case and strap and hand grip so I went with this so I at least had some protection.Will have to figure out the screen protector now which is not included. Would be great if it came with it I would have paid the extra money.
4,Fits great but doesn’t really stay in place around the corners but does the job well.
4,This case is nice but not the easiest to put on.
3,Kickstand latch is weak and when deployed will fold up when it receives a little pressure on it.  The rotating handle turns almost freely and the catches on it are weak.  I returned the first one I received and ordered a second one thinking that the first one was a fluke.  The second one had the same problems.  Great if you are looking for a protection cover for your IPad.  The on-off button on the cover works well with the IPad switch.  The same is true of the volume switches in the cover.  The pen fits well and charges right up when placed in the cover slot.  The pen also stays in place when the cover is accidently knocked around.  If you need just a protective cover for the IPad then this one is a great.
3,This is a reasonably cool case. Don't love that it's only black unlike Zenrich's. I also find the silicone rubber case to be a bit too smooth/silky because it feels slippery not to mention it's ultra bulky. But I am definitely returning because speaker holes do not line up - at all.  I've included 2 photos of the bottom edge and then one of the top. The speaker holes at the top are actually on the back side. So weird. Maybe this will work for an older model arrangement but I am not familiar with those myself.
5,Love the versatility of this my doctor was in awe of this product. Great for work can hold it with my hand or carry it like a purse for convenience. I don’t worry about setting my iPad down and forgetting about it as it’s always attached to me.
5,This is truly an outstanding case for my iPad Pro 11’’ in every respect ease of use functionality solidity. It is really easy to put together the iPad feels very secure. Using a screen protector is no problem. Another plus is how responsive the buttons are and the fact that the charging ports is covered. I enjoy using the adjustable hand strap. I have not yet used the adjustable shoulder strap but that is a unique feature of this case. Of course the case adds weight to the tablet but that is to be expected. I only wish that I have purchased a durable case. Time will tell but so far I have no regrets. Highly recommended.
2,I bought this for my new ipad. Seemed like a good quality case. Its unsnapped on the sides at least four times. The silicone is ill fitting and slips off meaning that i have to repeatedly take the whole thing apart and reset it in the case. I dont feel safe using it because i feel like it could come apart while im out with my ipad. I did like the stand and hand strap. I will not be giving this away or donating it because i wouldnt want to be responsible for a dropped tablet.
5,Good product - just wish it came with a screen protector had to buy it separately.It’s not bulky easy to hold onto really like it.
2,I dropped the case it protected the ipad but the case fell apart from about 5 feet
5,Facil de instalar llego con herramientas para instalar los botones y orificios calzaron perfectamente en general buen producto para Ipad pro 2021
5,Fits I pad 3rd gen 11 inch perfect  my daughter loved it
3,My strap just broke.  The holder so I had to order another one.  Just bought in August 21
5,This cover is perfect for my needs and easy to hold while durable!
3,The handle is inconvenient and not comfortable with no covering on the face
4,Kind of hard to use but its awsome
5,Ipad
3,This case did not stand a chance against my child. I wouldn’t recommend. For a adult however I like it.
5,Durable and kid proof brought a screen protector and put that on first then the case. No problem with touch screen space or button pressing.
5,
4,Great value.  Slight fitment issues but not bad.
3,Overall good product but the clips holding the product together is not strong some of them easily pops open.
5,Es muy resistente y protege bien el ipad. Aparte de ser un color espectacular (rosa). Muy satisfecha.
2,The product for protection is fine and seems to work. It's rubber parts are very stiff for opening to charge or pushing buttons and may get better with time.The big issue is the back handle where you put your hande spins and is super loose with no way of locking. So the ipad when trying to hold vertical just spins down one way or the other. Very frustrating product to be honest.
5,This fit the bill exactly.  I'm a pilot and needed a secure durable case with the ability to secure it to my leg while flying.  This case is exactly what I needed. The pivot on the back allows the rotation of the iPad and the adjustable strap allows me to velcro an extension to wrap around my leg which has the ipad nicely.  I highly recommend this case to ipad fliers..look nowhere else the bang for the buck is unparalleled.
3,While it is built tough enough to be handled by someone with fumble fingers the case covers enough of the screen that it is difficult for those same fumble fingers to swipe.
5,My daughter loves this case holds her IPad 11 Pro and the charges the apple pen at the same time! It’s perfect easy to hold the strap allows for extra safety and easy carrying! Love it! Wish I’d gotten it sooner!
3,the pink part is the hard plastic the black in the rubber once the child tugs on it a bit it will not fit right over the plastic much longer. otherwise the rest pieces are a fine.
5,It easy to use
4,This product seems very sturdy.  I just installed new iPad and I am most pleased.  The stand seems to work well.  And when I put the strap around my neck - my beloved thinks I look like #FlavorFlav!!!
5,Got this case for my 10Year old sons I pad pro my son is autistic and throws things and this has been great on protecting it
5,Good product would buy again.
5,Pretty happy about the case
5,I like the protection this case provides! Great investment!
2,I use the shoulder strap if you bump into anything the pencil falls out. poor design and expensive to keep replacing the pencil.
5,I was looking at cased 2 to 3 times the price. All the high ratings convinced me to give this a try. I'm very happy with it. I will probably look into a screen protector too.
5,Es fácil de sostener y la robustez es de buen tamaño
5,I like it much better and cool to carry it too big to bring out there but glad to use art for my jewelry I have to get used and cool pencils hold enough awesome.
5,Solid construction. Easy to handle
1,Slippery and plastic cover comes off easily and you can’t reach the edges of the screen to swipe up down or sideways! Horrible for an Apple product! Went out and purchased an OtterBox
5,This case is perfect for my iPad 11in pro. I chose this one because it doesn’t have a built in screen protector. I love the red color and it fits perfectly around the buttons and can keep my pen charged. It’s very durable and the rotating feature makes it perfect.
1,It broke and lost shape very easily in less than one month. Is a pricey product for the time that lasted. I would like a refund and i won’t never buy this product ever again.
5,very rugged easy to install great to hold
5,This seems like it will do just fine. The space for the pencil is perfect because my daughter was already leaving the pencil all over the house and it's not cheap! Seems as good of quality as the one she has had on her older iPad for 5 yrs.
5,-
4,The case because unsecured after a few days
5,Bought this case for use in the classroom as a teacher.  Wanted to be able to easily handle my iPad while using the pencil to take notes.  The handheld feature is great and easily rotates.  The kickstand and rotating features make it very versatile.  Seems durable and like it will protect the iPad.  Would recommend.
4,This is the best yet to keep your Apple Pencil in place....No more worries on the pencil detaching from movement.
5,Love this new case for our IPad Pro. The pink and the black color combination is beautiful. Its is sturdy. Buttons are accessible and the kickstand rotates easily but does not lock in place most of the time. Hopefully the kickstand gets better. My daughter loves it and We will be keeping it.
2,I really wanted to like this case. It’s nice and it seems like it would protect my iPad really well but it doesn’t hold together properly. I should’ve returned it in the beginning when it didn’t quite match up to securely lock in place but for the most part it was ok and I didn’t want to go thru the hassle of returning it. But now almost 2 months later it’s coming apart more and more. You can’t access the volume buttons and can barely access the home button because the rubber around the case doesn’t line up. I wish I could return this but the window has closed so I guess I’m stuck with it and I’m only writing a review now because I’m finding myself in need of a new case and feeling a bit annoyed...
5,Should protect from ordinary dings and drops. Very please with the fit and the protection it provides.
1,I was sent a case in which the packaging appears to have been previously opened. Additionally the silicon cover was broken at the top and did not properly fit the hard case. I'm sending it back and asking for a refund.
2,The products handle on the back is awkward to use the cover is very clunky.
1,Handle on back side of the case is not the right way to hold the tablet. Holding it in the strap has caused damage to the tendon’s in my thumb. Now I have to wear a brace and have trouble with my thumb holding and grabbing things. Now have to go to physical therapyBuyer beware!!!!
3,No es lo que esperaba
2,I bought this for my iPad and it didn't make it a week.  The thin plastic parts broke very easily.  Disappointed that I have to buy another one so quickly
5,This is the fourth one I’ve bought and I love them all. Their super easy to use for my kids and even better they last!
5,Muy resistible
1,You know this might be a little redundant as other people have already posted pictures but I just wanted to drive home the fact that this product is straight up lying about their product details. Only half of the cutouts for the speaker holes match up where the others are no where remotely close to the actual holes. its actually rather comical how they put "Precise cutouts easily access all ports buttons and functions thanks to the exact design makes sure every hole is in the exact place." in the product description.On a side note and equally annoying the stand is 1000% useless if u intend to write on it as its snaps closed with the slightest pressure. This is the biggest disappointment as its one of the few cases that has a vertical stand.Despite all this I actually would still recommend it if u don't care about either of these things. However I cannot give a product a good rating when they so blatantly lie.
5,The media could not be loaded.
5,Great case!  Ordered one for my son (he’s 9) and my daughter (she’s 15) wanted one as well.  These are better than any others we have tried!  Best value well worth the price.
1,The stand on the case broke just past the return period.  I tried to contact the seller twice (to the email address listed in one of the questions supfivesstock@outlook.com) but didn't hear back.  I had to buy a new one.That said the case provides excellent protection.  The iPad fell a few times and bounced right back.  I would've given it 5 stars had the seller was responsive.
5,Perfect for toddlers.
1,Own several of this style case from several brands and none of them are close to this cheaply made. The hard plastic bezel is warped and miss molded. The rubber casing has several untrimmed tags. The speaker cut outs are not even close. It just all around feels extra special cheap. Also why does no one make this case without an Apple Pencil holder. I don’t want one. I am returning. Hope the next brand I try is better.
4,It was a little difficult putting the cover on.
1,Hot Garbage!Camera alignment is way off.Speaker holes are nonexistent on the top of the iPad.Speaker holes are severely misaligned on the bottom of the case relative to the iPad.Mic holes are partially covered.Pain in the butt to remove when work is finished.The hardware of the iPad case is questionable It will surely survive a drop from 15' HOWEVER there are small flimsy plastic tabs that hold the case together which will fail & there are segments of the silicone membrane that are as thin or thinner than a rubber band that will shear and tear over time.I never write reviews on products but this is a major fail.  The product description and quality are two of the most misleading qualities of this product.
2,Very disappointed in the fit & finish of the product. Instructions were very poor. I did not feel the 900.00I-Pad was very secure in the product. Returned it the same day.
5,This case is great for an iPad 12 pro super durable! Also came with a screen protector. Definitely would recommend and purchase again if needs be
1,Had the case since May it’s the end of June and the iPad inside is cracked. My daughter has only dropped it a few times and not from very high so I’m extremely upset this so called durable case did nothing to protect the iPad. Based on the location of the crack I’m not even sure if it didn’t contribute to the cause. Would not recommend buying.
1,Got this for my son and the stand broke within the first week.
1,I must have read wrong or something. It’s plastic and don’t think dropping it would be good to go. I believe it’s not durable enough to hold up.
1,Doesn’t fit right poorly constructed junk for the money will be returning
5,
5,It was a little difficult to get the case to fit the I pad. Directions not good had to use a video in the reviews.
5,Fits very good on Ipad Pro 11 3rd gen.
5,The case works well.  It's sturdy and holds the tablet is place nicely.  I've also added a screen protector which isn't included and it works with the case.
5,Love this case!  So durable.  Love the long carrying strap.  Bought 2 more to give as gifts.
5,It is real durably and a great color I will be using it for work so this case will work great!! Good prices for it too!!
5,Love it. I have a 16 month old who has made it her sole purpose in life to get ahold of my iPad and phone so I have to have durable cases. This is perfect.
2,Bought this after screen replaced on our IPad because if it’s “durability”.  I Always keep a high grade screen cover on for extra protection.  Ended up with 1 crack about 2 weeks ago.  Tonight....it fell off the bed and not only is the screen cover shattered but so is the screen. So much for durability and protection. I did a lot of research and read reviews before deciding on this product....I expected more from this product besides more $ to fix my IPad.
1,The silicone is flimsy and stretched out. Does not confirm well. Not what I paid for and expecting. This case does not support my Apple Pro 11 inch device that cost over $1000. There are sharp prices on the hard plastic part. Someone can easily be injured. Reaching out to seller for refund
5,It is well built and easy to use
1,They are lying!  There are four speaker on the  iPad Pro 3rd Generation!  The case has only two and they are way out of alignment!  If you do not care about listening to quality music etc.  Then keep it!  It was clearly not made for iPad Pro 11" 3rd Generation!Returned it immediately.
2,After installed screen protector (not included paid separately).  Found out where hand strap- rotary dial polymer not seating tight polymer completely unsecured (flimsy bulky not tightness nor rugged).My girls like Black  +  Rose color which okay.  I should have gone with $69.00 case.  Disappointed.Not sure how to handle this?  Found another case from manufacture name:  Poetic Revolution Series Designed very sturdy rugged it for commercially used in the hospital.
1,This thing sucked so bad. Case didn’t snap together well silicone didn’t fit on the hard shell. All garbage.
5,My daughter is in love with her case. Its a very great quality case for a reasonable price I would have paid 50 dollars for the case I think its worth it 😊😊
5,It durable. Best case. It fits perfectly with my IPad.
2,I did not like the fit or assembly it’s not kid friendly I made a bad pick this
5,I was great
5,Nothing
5,Purchased to keep my 10 year olds new iPad protected. So far it has done the job! Not a single scratch ding or crack on his iPad.
5,Excellent quality!
1,It’s almost impossible to fit together and when it does it doesn’t even fit well. Not worth the effort
5,I bought this for my son’s new iPad for school.  It is sturdy and looks great.  Great value for the price.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Works great for my toddlers tablet he drops soMuch and tablet is good
5,Great
5,I like that this has a stand so my son can use this
5,Wife loves it. Perfect way to keep track of your apple pencil
1,This case is complete and total garbage. It feels cheap the second you open the package. The frame tabs broke with installation. I highly recommend you do not buy this unless you are desperate.
5,Good
5,Muy buen producto. Fácil de armar. Muy resistente y cómodo para agarrar el iPad.
1,Originally I really liked this case however now the front plate on one side will not stay closed at all keeps popping off. Also the spot for the Apple Pencil did nothing to stop it from falling out luckily I did find the pencil. Back to looking for a case. So today Jan 3 the plastic piece that the strap hooks through broke and my iPad fell onto the ground luckily it didn’t break even though the front plate came completely off. I definitely would not recommend this case.
5,Case fits iPad perfectly. seems well made and very durable. Great price too.
5,I like it
5,Love this case it sturdy and fits my Ipad prefect!
5,very durable bought 2 case
5,I love the color
2,Have had this a short time and the Velcro on the back no longer sticks. For a 6 year old using it it’s disappointing that this has happened. Would like to exchange but only lets me return and I can’t let him go without a case so I’m kind of stuck now sadly.
5,My son loves this color for his new iPad pro.. highly recommended
1,It’s an okay product. I do not think my iPad is very secure with it. The plastic keeps popping out of place. I would not recommend.
5,Good Value for your money
5,Very sturdy.  Fit perfect with screen screen protector.
5,Excelente caludad
1,I returned the item because it did not fit my gen 6 device. But it didn't come with any type of screen cover. I didn't realize that.
5,That it will help not to break easily
2,It covered too much of the screen.
5,Very stylish;durable and affordable
3,Received with missing pieces
5,I like it
5,I love this case!
5,Great product
5,Perfect for my son!!! Sturdy and functional!!
5,Great value.
1,At first this case was bulky but nice. This went downhill quickly. The kick stand won’t stay out once clicked and set down the lightest touch will disengage the stand. The Velcro on the hand strap no longer works and the swivel is very loose. Biggest flaw however is the fact that after dropped somewhere between two and three feet the scream has shattered from one corner in.
1,This case was very Flemsy and it broke very easy I was shocked on how bad it actually was put together it broke very easily.
1,I honestly thought my iPad was going to break when I tried putting this on. The plastic is so cheap and flimsy you want to scream. The volume buttons are cheap plastic that rattles around. Don’t buy this and just spend the money on a name brand case. The stress of buying this junk case wasn’t worth it
1,Looks nice and all but the issue is the volume up button. I’ve ordered a replacement and it’s the second one after the first one which was only a week before thinking it was just a defective one I received. Turns out to be just the manufacturing on it. Esthetically it looks amazing but unfortunately looks wasn’t the sole purpose.
1,I ordered a iPad Pro 11 inch case and the stand was no good… not everything that you get from Amazon is good  some products are no good…. I’m very unsatisfied with this product I’ll have to shop elsewhere for this product…..
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The case is cute overall.  But what I dislike was the fact that the rubber part on the top front is lifted . I'm not happy with this case will definitely return
1,It would have been great but it broke the second day I had it. Also my buttons weren’t usable
1,I used this for work I’m in the construction industry. I didn’t like the quality of the case. The clips to hang the strap broke a week after using it.
1,Se cae el caucho y se aprecia muy tosco
1,This case do not fit it also is made poorly.
1,Piece of garbage!!! Not compatible with IPad Pro 11”…save your money and your time seriously! Had to return this item the same day I got this
1,It doesn’t stay locked on my iPad good. I have to keep press the top part down on the side where the Apple Pencil sits. So not happy.
1,The rubber comes off if your kids play a lot of games on their iPad this case isn’t for them
1,the rubber piece consistently falls off - very frustrated - should have returned it but I didn't.  waste of money
1,My brand new iPad has a massive crack down the middle and is CURVED somehow! This case is AWFUL!!!
1,It’s not military that’s for sure cheap bad had way better than this one
1,Pésimo producto la goma es muy deformable y al final de una semana termina suelto no lo recomiendo.
1,It doesn't fit properly!
1,Nothing like the picture. It doesn't fit the iPad Pro 11. It's small. I wouldn't recommend this product.
2,Buy elsewhere!! It's very cheap and falls apart whenever I drop it. The screen protector that I put on it may be the only reason it haven't cracked yet. The plastic clamps don't all align properly which prevents a nice snug fit around the tablet itself. Buy at your own risk. It's not bad for the price but ultimately.. You get what you pay for!!
1,This is not military grade the case fills like my hands will slip out of it. The texture of the case is no good. I was very disappointed with this buy.
5,The OtterBox defender is a great case for your iPad. I have bought many of them throughout the years of different iPads and I’ve never had a single issue ever. It is ugly and bulky though and a bit expensive. So I decided to try this case for the first time ever and I am super pleased to say that it offers excellent protection the rotating stand is perfect and well it looks stylish to boot!  I also love the fact that this comes with a detachable yet sturdy shoulder strap.  Nice touch!
5,I bought this tablet case to protect my new iPad.The iPad I bought cost a lot of my savings.However I received this high looking high handle protective case.The size of the board is very good and does not affect charging.It's also good to watch videos or play games.There are a lot of functions where you need to read instructions which is a must.It would be a shame to miss out on powerful features.All in all my new iPad case is perfect for my happy purchase.
2,There's nothing wrong with it but just not what my son need it
5,This case is amazing! I love that I can use the stand to watch movies or the hand strap for reading. Highly recommend!
5,It’s very sturdy! Nice color and easy to assemble. Son dropped it and iPad was fine! Would buy it again!
5,goot fit  it is sturdy  quality is great.
5,I use this for doing job estaminets this has become an indispensable tool!
5,I love this product. It helps me at work.
5,The durability is nice and the feel of it is smooth. It feels good to hold it. Easy to assemble and has protected it so far. Great buy.
5,Great bit of insurance if you work outside and your IPad needs protection.Easy to put on.Buy a screen protector and you are all set.Secures the pencil too.
5,Sturdiness the color is very pretty
4,I liked the case very much. Easy to hold and stand for viewing. I bought this ipad pro 11 3rd gen. due to its picture quality and sound quality. The case covers 2 of the 4 speakers on the right side. Sound quality is a bit muffled on right side. Left side sounds great.
5,Excelente funda totalmente recomendable
5,Me ayuda a proteger mi tablet de cualquier impactó.
5,Super nice case.
5,My son loves it
5,Works as described
4,It's a great but apple pen falls off and its not safe for a 140 $ pen
5,Just as described.
5,Love it it’s sturdy iPad fits perfectly only problem is it covers your front camera makes real inconvenient for FaceTime or messenger video calls.
5,Easy to hold durable top of the line product for me!
5,I feel like my iPad is pretty bullet-proof when it's in this thing.  There's a bit of a learning curve to putting it together.  Make sure you lead with the two volume buttons into the rigid plastic backing first -- there's an orange sticker on it to show you where.  then that whole operation fits into the rubbery layer.  pull the rubbery shoulders over what you've got so far all the way around.  And then snap the rigid plastic front frame with two "snaps" on all four sides.  Test your power and volume buttons and you're on your way.
4,Got and installed it on the new iPad. I guess having an Otterbox I thought it would come with a screen protector but it didn’t and the glass is always exposed. Because of the rear handle I have to place it most times glass down in fear the that wobble of the handle could have a pet or me topple it over. Otherwise pleased with the item!
5,Awesome! Easy to install perfect fit secure and very complete. Totally happy with purchase.
5,I have had The Survivor and Otterbox and this product is just as good with more features. Hand grip  pen holder and kick stand is a must. Also comes with a shoulder strap I will never use. I would recommend this product
5,I lurched it for my granddaughters iPad and loved the practicality that I purchased a similar holder for my iPad mini. I love that I can hold it around my neck when I need my hands free and I can hold it in my hand when I need to use the iPad. It is secure 100% of the time. There is never any fear of dropping it.
5,Very good I am recommended
5,This case is a little on the bulkier side which is exactly what I wanted as it was going over my kids iPad. Easy enough for a 5 year old to use and love that it has a kick stand and handle!
5,Fits perfectly great coverage and best protection for our 5 yr old son!
4,So far it is working well
5,Great product and service thank you
5,would reccomand to a friend
4,A little bit of a fitment problem but not to bad
5,Exactly what I wanted. Not bulky or heavy but really good protection. I definitely recommend this product.
4,I purchased two of these and I am pretty happy with them.  I feel secure carrying my tablet in this case.  I don't carry a purse but my wife does and she loves the strap that comes with it.  I have two complaints.  First I wish the hand strap on the back was easily removed.  There are times I like the tablet to lay flat but it's not a big deal as it usually lays flat enough.  I just have to get used to it.  The second bigger gripe and the reason I rated 4 instead of 5 stars is the lack of any screen protection.  The UAG case that I replaced had a sheet of plastic over the screen.  It didn't do anything to protect against bangs but it did protect against fingerprints dirt and minor scratches (such as from normal use).Overall I'd recommend this case to anyone and in fact I have recommended to family members who also have iPads.
4,The back handle is curved so when you use the stand it’s not very stable.
5,I purchased a new iPad Pro and purchased this case.  Very sturdy. Looks great and well protected.
3,I loved it at first because it seemed so sturdy but then I started doing art work and good notes it started to annoy me cause I can lay it flat. This is better for children or if you're just using it to watch or do social media.
5,I like the fact that my new Ipad is protected with this case. It seems to have enough protection if I accidentally drop it.
5,I like this case a lot. The biggest feature for me is the stand allows you to have the iPad vertical or horizontal. I also love the handle and the Apple Pencil holder. I highly recommend this product.
5,No complaints.
5,Love this case! Fits great has space for my apple pen durable love the handle to hold it on the back & love the easy rest option to lean for my live meeting.
5,Good value for money
5,Apart from the fact that I do not have a pencil yet -- this is a BEAST of a case -- HOWEVER - you will need to get a glass film protector separately if you want to avoid scratching the screen. Good price and good product. Built like tank armor
1,Not true. It does not fit Ipad pro 11 2018
3,Comme indiquer
4,Seems to work fine but the strap on the back is not much use!
