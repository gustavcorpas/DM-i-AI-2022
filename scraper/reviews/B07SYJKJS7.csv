5,I get busted on for being called mission control. But I like when something can make things simple. That's exactly what this car charger does. The on off switching at the top makes it easy for me to control what I decide to have on if necessary. The 90 degree angle helps with space and the build besides materials used. This a solid car charger. I do plan on letting my friends know of this. More should have it.
5,I don‚Äôt have anything bad about this device to say that I dislike ut and as far as what I like about it I would say absolutely everything! The quality is amazing all the ports come in so handy and the fact that it has 2 socket ports that you can turn on and off individually with their own buttons is a game changer oh it also has a screen that will tell you the strength of your cars battery!!!! Im so happy with this purchase!!!
5,I usually buy these at auto zone for around $30 and the fuse always blows and I have to buy a replacement fuse with higher voltage. This comes with extra fuses but does not blow. It also has buttons that you can use to turn each socket on/off and tells you how much wattage you are using. I love this well worth the $
5,I have an older car from 95 and while what I got is pretty good for what I paid for it does come with a few flaws due to it's age some of those flaws is that I have a dash cam and when I turn my car on the dash cam never shuts off draining my battery one time I forgot I had it plugged in and it effectively recorded over my SD card many times drained my battery and broke my SD card.There's another problem ontop of this and that is my car's dashboard does not have a voltimeter which is slightly stressful especially considering the fact like I said above that I've ran the battery dry without realizing it a couple times one time was my fault another was due to a faulty component draining it without me realizing.Another battery that is drained on a daily basis is my phone battery which is normal but I don't usually bring a charger with me so can easily end up with a dead phone when using my GPS in my car if I'm on a long trip and forgot to charge my phoone beforehand which could be dangerous if I don't remember my way back as I have no way of charging my phone.So to sum this all up I needed something that would make shutting off my camera easier something to check my car battery voltage so I know when something is draining it and something that can charge my phone and quickly would be preferable to keep it topped up this product literally does all of this and more.Ontop of solving all my previous issues it also splits my CLR into two so my dash cam isn't taking up the only slot of my car for itself anymore has a SECOND slow charge USB port an 1.5A USB-C port a FUSE (and extras) and it also reduces wear and tear on my now abused original CLR no more having to constantly pull out my dash's plug out only to put it back in when I drive again and the blue light warns me if I forgot to press the button to shut it off not only that it even bends which lets me position it into a more easily accessible angle.That and despite all of the features and problems it solves it only cost $17.27 (/w tax) which is a steal for me thank you for the adapter Otium Audio Store! :)
5,So far it works and I have had no issues yet.
5,Works as advertised
5,I needed it got it and it works!
4,I have a Pixel 5 that fast charges with the cable and charge block that came with it.  Couldn't get it to fast charge with this item. Followed up with Amazon who put me in touch with the Amazon Seller pizago Direct. They said to use the QC3.0 port. I used that port with a new USB to USB c cable that is designed for fast charging.  But still no fast charge.
5,Appears very well made.i especially enjoy the feature which allows one to fold it so it does not interfere with the ability to close my center console.Also possesses on/off buttons to allow shutting it off without disconnecting the plugs from the Cigarette lighter.Very satisfied with purchase!!
5,Producto de acuerdo a la descripci√≥n aunque tengo poco tiempo de usarlo funciona a la perfecci√≥n los puertos de carga r√°pida funcionan perfectamente. Muy satisfecho con la compra.
5,Use with my Garmin & charge iPhones.
5,Had this for several months and it is still functional. I have several devices that connect to this and all is well.
5,Todo bien
4,bought this item because it has very good charging power and you can charge two devices at once
5,Nothing to dislike looks nice works well would recommend.
5,Great product and performs as stated.
5,None
5,This is exactly what I was looking for and love that the design has extra charging ports. Swivel makes it a little easy from the position it's at. Comes with extra fuse.
5,Works
5,I bought this to replace my previous Cigarette Lighter Splitter which began failing.I like the fact that it comes equipped with a 2.4-amp USB port a fast-charging port a QuickCharge 3.0 USB a USB C fast-charge port also the Independent ON/OFF Switch.It is an All-in-one design with flexible rotation which is very convenient.This splitter comes with a led voltage display which is very handy.I use it primarily to power my dashcam and charge my phone.The only drawback is the size (it is not exactly the smallest Cigarette Lighter Splitter)However time will tell about its durability
5,Does what it's supposed to do.This is the 2nd one I've purchased. There's a good reason for that. Product works well! üëç
4,Pros: Works as it should. Dual USB is a nice feature. Dual plug -in to power 2 devices is nice to have on older model vehicles that have only one output device that are typically cigarette llighters. Not confident device has a long longevity life but the price is attractive.
5,I bought this device specifically because my car only had one 12 volt outlet and I needed two for a recent car trip.  The device worked perfectly to allow me to use both my GPS device and a portable refrigerator for medications.  The device has worked perfectly so far although I have only had it for a short while.  Definitely did everything I needed.  I also used it to rapidly charge my iPhone and it went much quicker than the USB input in my car.  I haven't had time to do a total set of tests on the device but after I do I will update my review if necessary.
5,Looks nice. Works well.
5,Got this to replace my 3 socket car adapter which would occasionally not charge to do weight / size would disconnect . This 2 socket is solid and sturdy  but not odd weight displaced so it doesn‚Äôt pop out ever . Love how don‚Äôt have to constantly touch it to make the cords stay charged
5,Been using this for about 2 weeks in my work van. Works as expected. I can run the dash cam the work led flashing lights charge my phone the work tablet and a flashlight all at the same time. Does exactly what I wanted it to do. And the amp gauge seems accurate as well nice little addition.
4,Works like it should. Nice to be able to turn power off to half of the charger. It‚Äôs somewhat cheap feeling but why do you expect for the price and function you are getting. I only wish that you could bend it to a 90 degree angle. Time will tell on how long this lasts.
5,As I started adding accessories to my car I realized that the two USBs and the 12-v I had weren't going to be enough outlets; I'd need to find a splitter if I was going to use my dashcam and lighting setup if I wanted to use both products. That's when I came across this charger. I knew I'd need at least two 12-v and maybe an extra set of USBs given that one out of the two in my car is strictly dedicated to Apple Carplay and the other one is left for charging. I went with this one mainly because of the extra fuses. Not wanting to blow any fuses in my car I appreciate the consideration of the additional ones included.This splitter set works really well. I've had it for a few months now and I've had no issues with it. Installing it was a bit tricky as I really had to shove it into the 12-v and I was scared I was going to break it. That might've had to do with the outlet in my car but once it was in there's no wiggling and I really like that I can adjust it to various angles for movement and ease of access. I know it's got the battery reader on it as well which I don't really pay attention to it much given my car is only a few months off the lot. However I'm sure this will come in handy in the future so it's a nice little feature to have. I will also admit that I chose this one due to the 150W and the color - the detailing is blue which is what I wanted over the red version they carry. If you're not picky about color or the wattage then you could certainly find a cheaper version from this brand and I'm sure it'd work just as well.Overall it's a really useful product and I'm happy to have extra outlets in case anyone should need them when in my car.
3,I'm on the fence with this. I like it but it seems gimmicky.The voltage display is a nice feature 1 reason I bought this so I can remove my voltmeter and install a new gauge in its place. It's not that bright during day but adequate enough. On the other side of that coin it's not overpowering at night which is a nice thing.I have charged my phone with it but using a very cheap dollar usb cable. The 3.0 port acted like a normal usb port charge it couldn't handle/keep my phone discharging while plugged in. I need to test it with a better cable and report back if I get a different result. The 2.4amp port worked better with that cheap cable and kept the phone going. I don't have a C cable so I don't know if it works or how well. Unfortunately I don't have a test circuit to know what the actual amp output is when charging. Just going off how the phone reacted when plugged in.It does feel like cheap plastic there is a rubber sleeve to keep it plugged in but that also adds resistance when plugging it in and it feels like you may break it just doing that.I'm not saying don't buy it just saying it probably isn't going to outlive your vehicle.
5,AMAZING! Finally a charger that works!  I'm able to keep my front/rear cameras on AND use my QC mounted phone charger simultaneously! Even better when I am doing deliveries and have to have my GPS/BT features on it doesn't deplete my battery...  .instead my battery life actually increases! Great to not have to stress about a dead phone anymore!
5,It looks bulky but actually would fit well in a tight space and works well as it described. I used it for 2 days and someone break into my car and stole it :(
5,It's not made to put into the center arm rest cig plug it's kinda big and would be hard to close but I made it to work
3,Works as described. Looks good and seems well put together. Time and usage will tell.Update after less then one week of usage. Everything seems to be working properly with the exception of the usb-c jack. Wasn‚Äôt able to charge my iPad which was the reason i bought this unit to begin with. Thankfully there was a Walmart near by and I just bought something else instead. Still using the other features. We will see how long they last.
5,Works great so far and I love the voltage being displayed so you can see how the battery and alternator are doing.
5,Highly recommend for Mail Trucks! I have it and it‚Äôs the best! I‚Äôm able to run 2 more fans and it has 2 usb cables if you need it also. It‚Äôs perfect! Easy to use and I love it!
5,Great car charger and durable! This charger comes with extra replacement fuses but I have not had to replace any fuses. Also I like the blue lights inside each socket which indicates that it is powered. The on/off buttons on top to turn on/off each socket is not needed in my opinion but I guess someone else may need to turn one or both of them on/off. I use this car charger to charge my phone Bluetooth Transmitter and to power my Garmin GPS. The swivel seems to be useful if you need access to the charging ports in the way your vehicles charging ports maybe situated. I recommend this product.
5,Enabled me to connect a Dashcam and portable GPS into one outlet
5,I love the increased power capacity and the ability to  turn each port on and off. I also love that it has a digital display of the voltage of the alternator and battery!
5,I needed a dual accessory plug for my car and this one works great. It is made very well and I like the dual off and on power buttons. It has one for each side. I also like that it can be tilted up or down so it doesn't block the accessory tray in my car.
3,I got it so I could use my gps and charge my phone I‚Äôm so disappointed that none of them worked waste of money.
5,works great. 2 extra fuses. on off buttons for each side
4,I have been using this charger for a few days and it has been great so far.  I mainly purchased this for the USB-C port and the voltage display so I can monitor my car's charging circuit. As a whole the unit looks pretty polished and despite providing an additional two 12V sockets it does not take up any considerable space. This model blends in well with my car's black interior (Infiniti G20 / Nissan Primera).The voltage display is one of the best I have seen so far (compared with similar products I have used in the past). Its very visible during daylight but not as "loud" as I have experienced with other models. Its quite succinct and classy. One of the problems I have had with almost ALL the previous chargers with display is that sooner or later the some of the LEDs in the display stops working making it difficult to read the number displayed. Hopefully this model will last longer.Hopefully in the long run it will live up to its 5-year warranty. Lets see and I will update accordingly.
5,This charger or port is perfect.The items fit well and they do not slide around as some I've bought did. The plugged in items fit snug and secure. It IS A REALLY FAST CHARGE on the 2.4 outlet.I love this and wish I had gotten it sooner.I bought it for my IPad Garmin GPS and my Radar Detector.  ... Perfect.
5,I have now purchased my third one of these-  ( 2 for my cars 1 for my wifes).  This unit is attractive has versitle positioning on/off switched  "lighted" 12V sockets and an accurate car voltage LED display not to mention 3 USB ports (always active).  A very nice unit.
5,Well made. Looks good and works well.
5,I like this product because I can now operate my Dash Cam and also my GPS Driving system.It also has additional plug-in options for cell phones and other electronic devices. I also like this product because it also has it's own fuses and the company provided extra fuses just in case. I also like that it has a display that shows you the battery voltage output and allows you to determine when your battery is losing it life.
5,I needed an all in one solution as I have an older vehicle. Opened it up and the weight felt pretty solid the shell is plastic of course but still feels solid. Being able to position the angle is a very nice plus and the fact it lights up is very much a plus as you know exactly where to insert your plug into. It has everything you need 2 12 cigarette lighter ports QC ports. The USB- C port is a must these days as more and more devices are adopting this type of plug and having the voltage read clearly visible is nice and just gives it a sleek look. So far the devices I have plugged in with no issue and having multiple devices plugged in at the same time did not cause any issues as well. It also has a replaceable fuse the description states you get an extra fuse with but I received 2 extra fuses so a total of 3 fuses!. That extra effort on the sellers part make the all around experience perfect.
5,Very pleased with this purchase.
5,I have been using this for over a year now and it has always provided enough charging ports for all of the devices I need to power when on long road trips.  Recently I was very upset when one of the "lighter" ports wasn't working and I came to Amazon to order a replacement.  Upon reviewing my previous order I realized that the fault was entirely my own!  I had TOTALLY forgotten that both "lighter" ports have their own on/off switch and apparently I had accidentally turned off the second port.  Once I realized this and powered that port back on it now works perfectly again!  Bonus is that they included TWO extra fuses just in case!  So far I have NOT needed to replace the fuse and this port is still going strong!!!
4,I just want to start off by saying the main purpose I bought this was for the dual 12v sockets. Which work great!I have this plugged into my cars socket that shuts off when the car is off. I‚Äôm using two 30w usb c 12v chargers in the sockets. It seems to charge my devices at full speed so at least plenty of power from this unit to my chargers.All ports work fine at once as well. I can‚Äôt confirm charging speeds when all ports are used but they work!Very slim profile for having all the features this 12v charger has. Seems sturdy in my cars socket no issues with it moving around or falling out.I haven‚Äôt had a fuse blow so far it also came with two replacement fuses (3 in total).I would probably recommend this because it is useful & has worked as expected in my case.
5,Fast charging on the goi love it
5,I like the connector usb and the power switch for both sides
5,I ordered one of these and it works perfectly. So good I ordered another one. The second one arrived and one of the 12v ports didn't work. Got a replacement and exactly the same thing. I now have 2 I have to return which is a pain in the butt. So if you get one that works it's great if you don't it's not.
5,It's very sturdy once plugged in.  My car has only one cigarette charger so I can not use it for my dash cam and phone charge at the same time.  My dash cam does not take power from USB.  This device allows me to plug in my dash cam and QC 3.0 Type C and Type A USB ports for our phones.  Very convenient.  The size of the charger is a bit larger than expected.  It can bend any angel to fit the need.  It comes with 2 additional fuses and a rubber to cover unused charging slot.  Very nice.  Great deal.  I like it.
5,I bought this to use in my postal vehicle (LLV). They don't have AC so I have a seat cooling mechanism that can run on a heavy duty rechargeable battery or be plugged into the lighter socket. I also needed to charge my phone. This not only has 2 sockets but also has 2 USB ports. So I use the USB port to charge my phone and one of the sockets to run my seat cooler. So now I have an addition socket that I plug a small (crappy) fan into. t swivels so you can angle it however is convenient for you. This charger came with 2 fuses (it only uses one so you have a spare) and I ordered additional fuses...just in case. The fuse has never needed to be replaced...yet (and I've had this for almost 8 months). It charges my phone quickly and has been a life saver for me. I highly recommend this dual/multiple splitter/charger and would buy it again.
3,I don't know if mine is defective or what but it frequently slips and losses connection if I hit a bump. It's very annoying to have my Bluetooth keep dropping.
5,This charger looks unique and very effective‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm an Uber driver so I hope it lasts for a while
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†Slim slick yet powerful and handy. This item is a must for your daily usage or your roadtrip in an rv or in a car. With the lcd screen you can keep an eye on your battery voltage level at a glance. It's QC3.0 it makes sure it delivers a fast charging power to your device. The type c output and 2.4A USB port it can deliver all the power stated simultaneously as they are all built in parallel and not continuous. If you thought it would take your cigarette lighter port your wrong as it is a splitter too! The best over all is that the 12v ports have individual on/off switches! Allll of this talk is backed up by a 15 Amp fuse serving as a circuit breaker to save your cigarette lighter port and its fuse. For the price you can't beat it. I spent my own money and I'm not sponsored or have bias in my reviews.
5,Unlike similar items that I have tried the cigarette lighter sockets of this one have a snug fit to keep devices plugged in properly.  And the power on/off option solves a big problem that I had with previous chargers; my GPS and dash cam would sometimes turn on by themselves and would drain my Jeep's battery.  Now I can simply turn the power off for them on the charger & not have to worry about it.  I also like the fact that it doesn't take up a lot of space & you can adjust the angle
5,I've had this for a couple of months now and I am really happy with it. Charges my Pixel 3 up quickly. Wife and I can charge our phones with the dash cam on all at the same time.
5,Please note.  The product I have is the 95w item and this description is for 150 which is not what I ordered or received.  I have the 95w which was delivered on time and works as expected.  I am pleased with that purchase.  Please note.  There are two buttons on the top of the device to control power for each outlet.  You must press these first or your will not get power.  You will know you are receiving power because of the blue light on each outlet.Hope this helps.
5,This is our second one of these. We have one in my car and one in our work car. Works great and I love this product.  I definitely think it is worth the money.
5,Quite handy - It works as advertised
4,I purchased 2 of these one for myself and one for my husband.  My husband especially enjoys this as he has an older vehicle with only one cigarette lighter outlet forcing him to chose between his phone charger and radar detector :-)  He also loves the voltage display.  This charger works great when we're on trips in any of our vehicles.  The left socket stopped working on each of our chargers which made us believe they were defective after checking the fuses.  Didn't realize there is a button to shut each side off that we both must have accidentally hit.  Glad we figured that out as we really like these chargers.
4,Value sturdy looks good!
5,Great for additional charging port space.  All phone cords are in one port and does a good job.
5,I travel with a 110v powered oxygen machine for oxygen therapy (I can't handle oxygen tanks by myself and I travel alone often) and I also have floor lights installed in my car. This device allows me to run both at the same time. I have a power converter [first picture the small black box on the center console] that plugs into this device which is plugged into my car.  Then I plug the  oxygen machine [white machine on the passenger seat] into the power converter. I love my floor lights [second picture] because I can see around my car at a glance and I find the soft lighting very soothing to drive with. It relaxes me so long distance driving isn't so stressful. I also love that each power head of this device has its own on/off switch. So my floor lights are on at night and off during the day.  I highly recommend this product for everyone.
5,Have had this for a few months. Probably 3 or 4. Has been great to have multiple chargers in the car for road trips or even having to charge multiple things at once. Have an older car so only 1 car charging port. But this changed the game!  Fits good in my car and is adjustable so should fit good in most or all cars. Comes with extra fuse in case it blows. And has the new I phone port for the new chargers. Chargers fast and works as it should.
5,Great experience and product just what I was wanting
5,If you have an older car it probably does not have enough 12V or any USB ports. This charger is the cure.If you have gadgets that need 12V power and-or USB-C power this is the one you want.
3,The item is large and too bulky. It may be difficult to plug in. Also because of the weight it sometimes drops down. Otherwise it works.
3,Haven't had it long so can't say about durability.  But...It works fine as long as the end is straight out from the lighter socket.  Angle it more than a few degrees and it quits.  All lights turn off.  Presumably the power to the plugs turns off too but I did not check I just used it straight.  When I find my tester I will find this out.The reason I bought this one is to angle the end.  I have a GPS with a  short cord and I need an inch or two  additional length from the plug to the GPS unit.  If this thing worked with the end angled up it would be perfect.It's possible that it might last quite a while but my guess is that if this defect exists right out of the box then longevity is suspect.  We'll see.  Hope it does not cause my car to burn up.
5,Very good car charger good build quality
5,Use this for my video camera in my truck and to connect my gps system.
5,No issues as of yet. I used both cigarette outlets and separate USB  outlets. What I really like is the output LCD display that indicates the electrical current in voltage numbers for example 13.7 while everything is connected.  The ergonomics are: small enough to fit up to  3.5 inches in space width-wise the ability to position the charger in different angles adding flexibility in confined spots.  The plastic cover is smooth and has a sheen appearance. The addon fuse protector is a plus because the concept behind that is if something shorts it will blow the fuse first before the car fuses. And everyone will understand how tedious it is to get to some of those car fuses !! . For everyday use i think the price vs quality is justified.
5,This is an all-in-one 5-plug car charger which includes 2 12V sockets 2 USBs: 2.4a and 3.0a Quick Charge plus one USB-C Type connector!Also has a voltage display and two separate on/off switches for each 12V sockets.
5,I bought this Blue 2x socket 3x usb Car Charger because my wife and I kept leaving our heated seat cushion cover on and killing our battery. The lights and display on this  help us remember to turn it off and being able to just push a button the turn off one of the power ports is much easier than trying to find the inline switch on the cord of the heated seat cover.I will say the blue chrome trim around the charger has gone from a royal blue to a purple-ish blue color I assume from sun. Doesn't bother me since I like purple more than blue might bother other people though!
5,My wife likes it
4,This is a nicely built device with just a single issue.  Each cigarette outlet has a separate off/on switch but the throw for the switch is so slight it's hard to tell when an outlet is on and the lighting isn't enough to distinguish. Other than that it's a good buy.
5,Great product so far
5,Use in semi truck
5,Made of solid material and easily gets the job done. Fast charge usb for phones is great
4,This is my second car charger. The other one broke down what a disappointment. So far this one is holding up. I like it hope it will last longer this time.
5,Liked the design however for my 1998 F 150 Truck the gearshift comes too close in first and 3rd gear to use this device's 12v outlets. Eventually I will try this on the other vehicles we own. I do not expect this to be a common problem for most people because few people own manual shifting vehicles with 12 outlets in close proximity to gear shift travel. It did seem to function very well and would allow more power to get to my magnetic charger but the point of this ancient truck is that I need to drive it. This is a great way to add many device capability to a vehicle with a single 12v outlet.
5,I like this item as it charges my phone and I can have my GPS plugged in to. Also like having the digital voltage readout to know the voltage of the battery and charging system. The extra fuses included with the adapter are nice. Hope I never need them or I can find where I put them if I do. There was a small rubber ring or gasket included in the package without any explanation of what it was for. I have it stored too just in case I can figure out what it is used for.
5,Works waht I wanted it for
5,We have to use backseat fans for both of our kids in the car but that was a problem since they both needed to plug into the cigarette lighter/charger in the front. We ordered this so they could both run at the same time and it works amazingly! The power is great and the usb ports to plug our phones in is a great addition that helps a ton and will be great for trips once we're able to go on them again. Another bonus is the fact that it's movable so we're able to adjust the double charger to avoid bumping into anything in the front area of the car (like the small storage parts where we set our phones and hand sanitizer). Overall this is a great item and for a great value! We highly recommend it!
2,Within two weeks the voltage digital readout and usb-c charging port both stopped working. SO NO I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT any more than I recommend a non multi-millionaire vote retardlican.
4,Works well I love the extra USB ports and the fact that I can just hit a button to turn it off and on.
4,I like it with one exception. When you got two things plugged in its almost impossible to see the display showing the amps.  I moved it in such a way that I could and like I said it works good and it showed me right off the bat what was going wrong  I needed a new alternator.  It is a must have if you don't have a display on the car and you need to know that kind of thing to make sure you are getting  a good charge built up on your battery.
4,I actually bought this on a whim and figured I would end up returning it but its a keeper!!  ITs good quality construction the ability to turn the individual lighter plugs on and off is very convenient and the three types of USB charging accommodate my many devices.  I may get another one for my car. I dont use as much stuff there as I do in the truck but it would still be a good thing to have.  I highly recommend it it's definitely worth the $20.
5,Works great so far after a few months of use. Stupid auto manufacturers putting only one outlet in a big truck. This fit the bill perfectly and works great. The phone charger port it great. Charges for 10% to 100$ in about 20 minutes which is faster than the plug in lightning charges I use at home.I am very happy with it.
5,To be fair I haven't used this long. I'll update later w/ a long term use review if there's a problem. So far it works. My previous one (different brand) killed fuses w/ the quickness and messed up the connection in my car such that I had to replace the charger/ashtray area. I know that's a really low bar but it's something worth mentioning.  I appreciate that the main part pivots from the stalk (the straight tube part that goes into the cigarette lighter/12v slot) in 2 directions. Many others only pivot 1 direction. I also appreciate that the fuse slot is on the outside making it much easier to replace fuses (3 were included w/ mine) if needed. Having the switches to turn 12v slots on/off is definitely nice.
5,I bought it for the display but I ended up liking it for all the features that it offers
4,It works fine but it bends sometimes and is not sturdy. When it bends the stuff I have plugged in loosens up and unplugs. Other than that it works fine.
5,I‚Äôve been using this device for the past couple weeks and it has been fantastic. I have an older vehicle that doesn‚Äôt have a USB port so it‚Äôs really nice to be able to charge my phone (fast charging) while using other plugged in devices. If you‚Äôre wondering I have an ambient lighting kit and an FM Bluetooth transmitter plugged in simultaneously.It‚Äôs also nice to be able to individually turn off ports (light up when on) as well having those extra fuses in the instance of a short-circuit blowout. So far I haven‚Äôt had any connection issues; it may take a second after starting the vehicle to get the power running through it but it is fast nonetheless. Overall well-designed product feels and looks nice too.
4,Worked well fast charging didn't kick in for my devices but might have been due to the plug ins I used
5,I have a cigarette lighter plug in my glove box and use it for my footwell lightning. Recently I also started using a dash cam got an mobile hotspot in the car. Since I need to charge from time to time I wanted to split the plug in the glove box. I did my search and decided to give this unit a chance. Unit works perfectly fine. The battery voltage is a nice additional feature to check the battery status. Since my dash cam is also doing parking mode (connected to the power magic pro which prevents battery drain by eating to 12v) I check my battery status from once a week to make sure everything is fine. In addition the nice blue led also lids up the glove box. The unit itself looks very solid and fits perfectly. Highly recommended.
5,So far this has been a really useful adapter. I bought a dashcam and it came with a cigarette lighter plug and I was already using that plug to charge my phone. So this solved my issue in splitting the plug and adding USB and USB-C. The fact that it has USB-C is extremely useful for me since I've had times where my mirrorless camera battery was dead (my camera takes USB-C to charge it)...and I've always been without it since I dont have an AC adapter. Anyway this solves THREE of my issues. Great design as well. Would buy again...for my wife!
5,Very thoughtful design. The on/off togle is perfect for my dash cam. Charges all my devices with ease. Just right size and swivels out of the way making changing stations or the A/C a snap.
4,Really like the cut off switches.  Was hoping to get a superfast charger.  This one appears to be a fast charger.  The voltage indicator is a great feature.
5,I am using this unit on the dash for my Ram 2500. There is a 12v receptacle on the top of the dash and having this plugged in allows me to power my TPMS trailer camera and other items without having cables draped down the front of my dash. Great addition and having the voltmeter display is useful for a quick check of both the charging voltage and static voltage when the engine is off. Love it.
5,I bought this car charger a few months ago.  I felt I‚Äôd give it a few months before giving a review so I can give a real world evaluation of the product.  So far it has been good.  I have a radar detector plugged in plus 2 phone chargers.  I typically charge an iPhone 11 Pro while the radar detector is on.  Sometimes my passenger plugs his iPhone 11 as well.  So far the unit  has not given me any problems.  The radar detector plugs in fine unlike with my old charger where the plug comes out by itself.  Good purchase!!
5,I can't really speak to durability I just purchased it. The two lighter sockets both worked (radar detector and GPS performed fine) and I like that they can be switched on and off. I also checked the 2.4 amp USB port with a smart phone. The battery meter voltage display is also nice. I have a voltage meter I carry in the car because of battery issues I have had in the past this can serve the same purpose - helping to monitor the battery level. It is compact and helps maintain a cleaner look in my car (previously I had to keep my ash tray open to plug in a second device). I would recommend it so far.
5,Es un Cargador que cumple perfectamente con lo que se promociona. Robusto y lo he utilizado en diferentes autos y en todos ha funcionado siempre bien.Totalmente recomendado.
5,I have a few of these gadgets but I needed one that has triple functions Cigarette Lighter Voltmeter and USB output that I can use also for my solar panel installed on my van's rooftop that has 20V output.  The Voltmeter will prevent mistakes plugging-in a 12V only electronics. The dual 12V output will let me plug-in my portable 12/24V fridge and my 14V-30V battery solar generator . And with an EXTRA USB outputs is a BONUS!Another PROS with this product the negative part of the plug has two  RUBBERS on the side WHICH MAKES THE PLUG HOLD TIGHT INTO THE FEMALE SOCKET which insures great contact and prevents accidental ejection when plugged-in .
5,It does what it says it does. I got 2 of them cause my 2015 Wrangler doesn't have enough cigarette lighters sorry accessory ports for all my gadgets. Let's see how well it holds up over time....Wish they made cars like they used to where every passenger had a cig lighter. Ok you can leave the ash trays out but I'm this day and she you still need the outlets between phones GPS's emergency spot lights cameras or whatever else u need to charge.
4,Power works great. However the hinge is not strong enough to stay upright if you use both plugs.
4,I love it. It barely lets the armrest close though when plugged in (one of my chargers is way too big). The good thing is it bends so if I get a smaller charger for one of my devices that wouldn't be an issue. I can turn on/off charging for my devices separately without having to unplug this one. It tells me how much voltage is currently in use (it's usually around 13 for 2 devices). It should be anywhere between 12-24. So I guess if I'm charging too many devices at the same time it would let me know and - possibly - shut itself down before too late.
4,It is sturdy flexible and it fit in the limited space of our Nissan X-Trail. We now can use our Garmin have room for a dash-cam and can plug both phones in for charging.
5,If you change vehicles such as rentals and you need more than one quality charging ports this product is for you.
5,I purchased the Otium car charger/splitter to be able to power my GPS unit and charge two cell phones all at the same time. I was pleased when I opened the box to find a well-made good quality splitter that was just the right size to fit in my van cigarette lighter without adding too much bulk. Otium even included two extra 15-amp fuses. The device works as expected for the GPS and charges the cell phones very fast. I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend to anyone.
5,I just needed a 12V splitter as my new truck has only one outlet in the cab! Unbelievable! Anyway this also has extra USB regular and USB C which also can be handy. I also like how it articulates to allow more orientations. Only time will tell how it holds up in the long run. Only been using it for a couple of solid weeks on the road.
5,I bought this to put on the single 12v port in the back seat of my truck.  It works great but I did notice that the hinge was a little weak and the top part of it would constantly point down at the floor so I used Gorilla Glue to fix that.  But I have had my son and mother-in-law back there charging their phones at the same time while using them as well as my briefcase with my MacBook plugged in and charging.  And I had not even started using the two 12v ports yet...  so yeah... this is worth it.
5,I have an older vehicle with a lighter that does not have enough voltage to allow me to hook up a radar detector and kept blowing fuses. With this the radar detector works perfectly with no more blown fuses
4,Broke after 2 months and I can't return because the return window is already closed.It won't make contact with the energized parts of the cigarette lighter port.Save your money.
5,This worked really nice I had interior cabin lights installed and then wanted to get a dashcam as well and this allowed me to make that idea a reality. I am able to reliably use both the interior LEDs and Dash Cam by using the power splitter. However I would not recommend using the QC ports and type C for charging while both ports are being used.
4,So far it's working.
5,La presentaci√≥n del empaque es muy buena viene en una caja de carton con un instructivo muy claro.  El material de adaptador se siente bien al tacto y est√° muy bien acabado y su dise√±o es bonito.  Ajusta perfecto en tomacorriente y el rango de inclinaci√≥n se adapta muy bien a lo que necesito. Funciona bien con una adaptador adicional de USB por si se quieren conectar 2 o mas dispositivos USB adicionales.  Tambien funciona bien con un inverter de 100 W.  Aunque aun no he probado con toda la carga el hecho de que sea de 150W de potencia no deberia de tener problemas.  Muy recomendable.
5,Because I have a three channel dash cam in my car and the cigarette lighter stays on all the time and the manufacture does not recommend that you leave the unit turned on all the time so I bought this so I can manually turn it on and off without pulling it in and out of the cigarette lighter and wearing that out was my thought so I like it plus it still gives me access for another cigarette lighter outlet and USB
5,Used to charge two heated seats in my wrangler as well as charge phones. Love the on/off switches so it doesn‚Äôt drain my battery when not in use.
5,I got this so that I could use my phone charger and my dash cam together. Of course it's able to do this but I can also charge 2 more iPhones and my Nintendo Switch while I'm traveling. I really like the way it looks too. It's beefy plastic with glowing blue lights on the inside. Oh you can also turn off each charging port individually if you need to for whatever reason. Definitely a good buy high recommend. I'll be sure to update this review if it breaks!
5,I'm so pleased with this 150 watt version of the Otium ashtray splitter--charger because I have not only my tiny 2" dashcam plugged into it but also my huge Escort 360 radar detector. The radar detector weighs several ounces so I imagine it requires more watts to operate ( I don't really know if this is true or not). I also really like the two shut-off BUTTONS on the Otium because I can leave the splitter IN the ashtray when I turn off the car-- without having to pull out the splitter!!  Finally when the car AND splitter are both turned off the splitter's yellow LED light remains on and reveals the car battery's voltage status...usually around 12.
3,So far it charges ok and the switches work.My problem is it is only a 45 degree adjustment and there just isn't room for that in the car.The plastic that keeps it to 45 degrees bends very easily and I can see it being a future breakage point. It will end up in the back seat for the kids instead of on the front where I need it.
4,This is a good product the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it‚Äôs really shiny. If there was Matte version I would totally buy it again. I like the idea that it bends up and down. It‚Äôs a bit bulky in size but I put it in the arm rest compartment to hide away from view.
5,Our new car only had one charge port and this completely solves that problem and then some. Get it!!
4,I like so far almost everthing about it except that it sliwly works itself out and loses connection but in all the cars i have/had they all seem to do this ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èIdk why just a thing i guess
5,I bought this to add an extra cigarette port for my car since I just purchased a Garmin and wanted to be able to charge my phone and use the Garmin at the same time but it came in handy with the 2 additional usb ports because I used it in my 2nd car a 2006 Altima  since I have a FM transmitter in it to play music from my phone to the car and the usb port on the transmitter stopped working so I plugged the FM transmitter into the Cigarette Lighter Splitter and I was able to listen to the music and charge my phone using the usb port and the voltage was always above 13.0 the whole time
5,This is a game changer worth the money. No complaints. Works great
5,Works great to power two 12V chargers and 3 USB outlets.  Having an On/Off switch for each charger is a nice feature when you don't need the outlet on.  Easily powered my rear observation camera and GPS unit.
5,I like this one The sockets are tight and the unit is well built and sturdy The fuse for it is easy accessed and the voltage gauge is a nice touch. The usb ports work well Don't understand why they are different amperage tho seems to me it would make sense to make them both the same power but whatever not a deal breaker. This is the the best and hopefully the last one I purchase. Would recommend it.
5,This will go into my race car and serves a couple of purposes.  It will power our in-car camera (USB) and the in-car camera from our race series (12v & USB).  I also want it for the voltage output reading so I can eliminate a gauge from an already busy dash.  Ideally it fits into a car's 12v port with some tightness.  This unit is very tight.  I don't expect it to be removed often but if it was going to be removed often i would add a little dielectric grease to make it removable without feeling it is being forced.
5,I have a dual phone charger that fits into my cigarette lighter.  However I was going on a trip and I needed a cigarette splitter.  But I didn't want to give up dual phone chargers.  This one device does it all.  I like the on/off buttons so I don't have to worry about draining power when I turn the ignition off.  Also if one side isn't being used I can simply turn it off and not worry power going to the open socket..  It was a big plus on my trip.  This one device handled everything with ease.  I would buy it again.
5,first time I didn't have to switch cables to powered all my Electronics at one time fuzz busterauto gps navigatorcell phonepower pack it's just what I needed.
5,Great Product Exactly As Described.  Well Made & Great Price.  Recommend
5,good idea for a product.  works well.  sturdy.
5,The product is as stated in the Amazon description. It arrived on-time and I'm enjoying the product. I needed a charger with more power as an older unit (not made by this company) was not cutting it anymore with regard to my power consumption needs.This charger's USB ports include a Quick Charge port which is exactly what I needed for my phone as I use navigation software quite frequently. While using my previous charger the battery wasn't charging adequately during high power consumption periods of time. I'm glad that I ordered this product. It has made a world of difference.
5,So far so good.  I like the fact that I can manually turn on and off the cigarette adapter plugs plus it offers USB charging to charge my phone and tablet.  I use the cigarette plug to run my dash cam which in this day and age you'd be crazy not to use one driving in Houston.  LOL... The volt meter also helps knowing what's going on with your battery/alternator life while driving and parked though I would like to have a master kill switch so it doesn't drain any battery life when parked in the long term.
5,Good output. works well for my application to add a second 'lighter' output in car.
5,This is a great addition to my car accessories making my life a little more convenient
4,This is a nice excellent car Cigarette Lighter Splitter that offer a lot of feature that is very useful for car person fanatic. I used it for powering a lot of mobile devices and being able to use the two of the cigarette lighter power the mobile espresso on to go. A center usb c was good touch fit nicely. Thank you ^__^
5,Easy to use and operates as described
5,worked good to charge phones power other in car devices gave additional 12v "cigarette lighter" for electrical power for in car devices.
4,Now I could see the battery capacity when I driving. Fine quality and good workmanship plus nice value.
5,Muy bien gracias
4,Works as described so far
4,I like it
5,Needed an adapter to add more outlets for an older car that just has one 12V cigarette lighter spot.  This allows me to plug in 2 items (GPS and radar detector) as well as charge my phone.  The fast charge slot worked great.  I didn't know the charger had an adjustable "neck" area so I could adjust it to face up/down more.
5,I've been using this for about two weeks. My Honda Fit Sport only came with 1 charging port... This is a life saver! I can charge 5 devices depending on the volts. I can now use my mirror dash camera and charge my phone at the same time for weekend road trips.
5,Really nifty little item! Besides telling me what my alternator is doing. I just put new one in since last one went bad an also ruined two replaced batteries before i realized it was alternator. So being able to keep tabs on that really makes this charger exceptionally good thing to have. Also powered everything i plugged into it.  Very happy with this!
4,Muy c√≥modo
5,I have multiple  devices that needs to be charged via 12 V(cigarette lighter) port but car only came with two ports. This really solved the issue at very little cost and it was a breeze to set up. Just plug it in and you're ready to go. I love how there are two USB ports and a USC port so you can charge your phone AirPods  etc while using it.
5,This charger works as described--love the volts output. Like that it has replaceable fuses and switch for charging outlets.
5,It's a bit large but it has a lot of connections. It's a bonus that it displays the output voltage so you know the charger is working and you know your alternator is charging properly.
5,Just finished a two week trip and was able to charge two phones charge my Jackery for camping and run my backup camera on my camper.  Was very pleased with this product's reliability and charging power.
5,For the customer who asked how accurate the voltage meter was (that is the main reason I purchased it) I checked the voltage with the engine not running and a good quality DMM read 12.52V.  This device read 12.5V.  I also checked the voltage with the engine running which caused the digits to move around a bit and the DMM read 14.0 - 14.5V.  This device's readings were in the same range.  So I can safely say that since this device reads to the nearest 1/10th volt it's pretty much right on.
5,Works really great. Using the regular USB port on the charger my Galaxy S10 reported charging current of 1.9 amps at 60% capacity without using fast charging option on the phone. The charger looks really sharp with its shiny black surface. I really like the car battery voltage display. Allows me to see if charging with the engine off has depleted too much battery capacity and it's time to run the engine. The readout is accurate as checked by voltmeter. Overall would recommend this charger.
5,Our older vehicle has 12v outlets that do not turn off when the ignition is off.  We added an aftermarket back up camera and it keeps draining the battery unless we unplug it.  Now we can just use the on/off switch on this charger and turn the camera off when not in use and save our battery Easy peasy.
5,It arrived super fast and is very simple to use. Good value for the money.
5,This is very well built and gave me the two 12V power outlets I needed for a towed vehicle aux brake and light strip.  Included two spare fuses which I have not found necessary to use but a welcome extra.  I was also impressed by the rubber friction pads added to the male plug that provides a snug fit in the lighter (power) receptacle of my car.
5,Has quick charge which works very well. This is the main reason why I bought this product over others. Had multiple options for charging and includes additional fuses which is very handy.
5,Use this item everyday. Build quality is very good. Charges fast. Comes with extra fuses if needed but so far I haven't had the need to use the extra.
5,This fit in my 05‚Äô Civic. The 2 outlets both charge fast and comes with 2 extra fuses in the box. It also has 2 on/off switches for each socket making it easy to use and doesn‚Äôt drain the battery. I highly recommend this one. And the socket moves up and down while connected so it doesn‚Äôt cut power.
5,The USB ports in my car are not working anymore. So I've purchased this product to charge my phone while driving as well as for the dash cam.  It does what it needs to do very well. Phones are charged pretty quickly and I have an extra cigar jack which I will use for a car cooler or portable neck massage device for a longer road trip. Overall I'm satisfied with the functions of this charger and its sleek design as well.
5,Individual port switches.Actually operates my Garmin device and charges my phone at the same time.
5,Loved the fact that it also displays battery voltage to monitor draws.  Also with a USB-C as well as 2 USB ports one of which is a high-speed port to use.  The usability and value for such a well-built product really make a difference in the ability to use multiple items in my car.
4,I like it it's not slow on charging
5,I am always afraid of buying chargers or items like this.  But this thing has a decent weight for its size feels solid.  My only thing to worry about is the right and left buttons on top they kind of rattle a bit.  Everything else seems fine as far as I can tell.
5,I've owned 4 different models of a splitter like this all of them said they could fast charge. I have a pixel 3xl. this is the first one that actually does. It looks to be made well and the swivel is great.
5,Used this in my car because it's a 2011. When I plug in the audio cord to it it has throne static all except 1 time.
5,I had few chargers over the yearsSome would break or stop charging entirely.While other just would not work.Yet this one simple effective defiantly cool looking. With a lot of holes no pun intended for charging I meanHas A c type charger with two Lightning chargers for  apple products but it has a cool light feature that you can turn on to see which charger you are using.Over all i used daily and love it.
4,Great product well made but a tad bulky 100% would buy again
5,Great producthas the most features for the money been using for 2 months and no problems
5,This product was exactly what i was looking for.  Works great when needing additional 12V/additional USB charging ports in a vehicle.  This is the second one I've purchased.  One really good feature is the ability to control the on/off power to each socket independently.  This feature is terrific in the event you accidentally drop a metal object in the open socket.  With the power off to the empty socket you will not blow the fuse.
5,I'm  using it for a 10 days...Working excellent
5,No issues
5,I use this adapter in my semi and it charges my phone while using my dash cam and heats my food in my hot logic food heater with no issues.
5,Works great. Don't have to keep taking my GPS plug in and out. Love the on/off switch. Displays your voltage as well.
5,Got this for my 1999 Jeep wrangler.  It only has 1 power outlets so this will really help.  I like the swivel feature which gives me the ability to move it out of the way for my shift lever.  The digital power meter is also a great feature.  It came with 2 extra 15 amp fuses
5,The LIGHT for  on/off is not visible except inside the metal tube! What's with that?
5,When I first received this product It was not working and i try all the fuses that it came with. Even with the difference fuses it still wont work. So I contacted the company and they was so nice and agree to send me an other product. Because of the great service they provide for me. I went around to my friends and tell them how great this product is and I let them try it out and they LOVE IT!I highly recommend this!
5,I'm pleased with this purchase.  It turns my only car outlet into 2 USB ports and 2 charger sockets.  It charges my iPhone at USB 3.1 speeds and allowed me to add Bluetooth capability to my 2007 Impala.  This adapter has power switches for each socket so you may turn them on or off independently.  Also it displays the cars battery voltage.  All around upgrade in my car.
5,It fits really tight have to make sure it is all the way pushed in.  I like it because when the car is not running I can tell the battery voltage and make sure I don't run the battery down to the point the car won't start.I have an LG G6 phone and the QC3.0 port does fast charge my phone.
5,01:  Positively a very useful splitter tht plugs into a cigarette type plug.  ( 3 usb ports of which one is high speed + 2 cigarette type ports = total 5 ports )02:  The price is right ... positively03:  It's well made / sturdy .... good itemThis is n item that every-one can use as all the vehicles never hve enough ports for all of tody's electronics.
5,I drive a 2014 vehicle that doesn‚Äôt have heated seats. I bought one but it takes up the entire port. Buying this lets me charge my phone use my heated seat warmer and leaves room for others to charge! I love that it can move up and down as well! Won‚Äôt block your hands!
5,Looks great and works as it should. Needed a splitter for my truck and came across this product. Its well made simple plug and play and does the job. Love the fact it has a a tilt option as well as the ability to switch on/off each port.  Worth the price !
5,Great product - works like a charm. Just what I needed to attach a radar detector in one port and a Bluetooth FM wireless transmitter in the other port. All works great. Highly recommend.
5,This splitter it‚Äôs perfect. I tried two different ones from other stores and didn‚Äôt hold the power I needed. I am a VanLifer (live in a all solar converted van and travel) I need a splitter to hold my fridge 24h and my WeBoost Drive. This product does that and more! It lets me turn on and off the DC plugs separately and it tells me the voltage in use.
5,I added a satellite GPS to my Jeep.  There are not any USB ports in my Jeep just the one cigarette lighter port.  I needed another port to be able to plug in the GPS and my cellphone.  This works perfectly and charges fast.  Very pleased with the item and the seller.
5,This is amazing!  We needed to be able to plug more than one cigarette lighter charger into our van and this one more than fit the bill.  The extra two USB ports are amazing and one is even for faster charging than the other.  Great product...great price.
5,Only one cigarette lighter makes it hard to plug a portable refrigerator and GPS at the same time. The Otium 2 socket cigarette lighter has fixed our problem in  RV and cars. The two USB ports and a USB-c port are great to charge our phones. The portability of the socket head makes it easier to position it.  The sockets can be individually turn on and off.
5,Purchased the dual adapter because I also have an air purifier that plugs into the adapter and didn‚Äôt want to compromise that while using my fm receiver (which allows me to use handsfree option with my cellphone in the car). This works wonderfully and love the option of being able to turn off/on each individual socket & also allows to plug in via usb. Definitely worth the priceüåü
5,this will work well in my truck
5,This is great. I love that it can adjust upward while in the socket. I've got my dashcam and my bluetooth adapter plugged in and both work great. Easy to use.
5,Wow! So impressed! I was worried it would not extend out far enough to clear the area and that it would be too wide....BUT...it has a swivel arm and it fits perfectly in my 2017 Mustang.I needed two ports for a dash am and an electric wind guard that lights up. This product met all my needs!Bravo to the design team on this one !
5,I like it.  It pivots up or down shows voltage and has a C plug in. There is an on/off switch on each cigarette lighter plug. Nice for the radar detecter. It sticks out a bit far but that's why it pivots. Good buy.
5,We have several IPhone 11s but in our Nissan Pathfinder we only have (1) 12v power outlet. My original adapter could power all devices plugged into especially when we have our wireless brake controller for our Travel Trailer plugged in. We notice all devices were getting charged. This unit has the wattage and we were able to have all devices charging! Product seems well built and we do recommend product!
5,The most remarkable feature of this product is that its voltmeter is extremely accurate-- within about 0.1 V.Most small mass-market voltmeters of this kind are so inaccurate as to be of little use.This one is remarkable and is thus highly useful for monitoring battery and alternator health.
5,This was more than I was looking for. It has ample charging power has a swivel head to avoid 4wd shifter fast charging port and displays battery charge level which is very useful in monitoring your car's battery health as you get close to end of life. Also had two spare fuses. Although a couple dollars more than some other brands this one had the extra power to justify the cost.
4,I like all the functions as described.  I give it 4 stars because it's a little too bulky to fit in my car.
5,It came in handy in a tractor trailer when only one cigarette lighter plug in was working . So me being able to plug two things in one is great.
5,This was perfect for our last road trip. When you have phones a dashcam and a tablet all bring charged at the same time in the front we needed mutliple ports.
5,Just what I needed.  The car charger helps with the Radar detector and allows us to easily charge our phones/devices.  BEST feature is the fuse that protects all the devices and is easy to change if needed.  The swivel ability of the plug in makes adjusting the charger to better meet our needs.  Plan to buy one for each car.
5,The meter is great. The on off on each side is awesome and the Usb chargers is great and it will handle all at once.
5,Like the design
5,I love the way it fits  beside shifter just what my car needed an upgrade
5,I have an older model 4Runner.  The only accessible power source is the car charger.  All other outlets are hidden in glove box which makes it hard to use.  This is the perfect solution for me.  now I don't have to share the charger w/ my wife.
5,I needed extra USB and cigarette lighter sockets and this was exactly what I needed. I can plug in the compressor for my nebulizer and my million candle spotlight and plug in my dash cam phones etc.... Works awesome no complaints... I would buy this again.
5,This item was very easy to setup and the extra stuff that comes in the box is a great addition too. I don't want to spoil it for the new buyers but it made me happy to see a business go the extra mile to provide customer satisfaction.
5,This worked great in my truck. Since my cigarette lighter plug-in has voltage on it even when the truck isn't running having the ability to turn the power on and off on the adapter is actually what I was needing. With it being a charger also is an added plus.
5,it does not charge anything by itself it's a splitter which works great and easy to change fuses if they need changing and I like that it shows' line voltage.
5,This is a great product. It has a solid design and includes a fuse (with two spares) important since you might be pulling lots of current from the two outlets. Quick Charge 3.0 and USB-C charging is a great plus that isn't found on many other splitters.
5,Running my GPS & dashcam. So far works great. Really like the buttons to turn off either side.
5,Easy to plug - We charge the Garmin and The iPhone-  Easy access to add Joe's Phone and Grandkids Fire Fox.  Extra Fuses came with it-  but have not had to change them yet.  My Daughter is purchasing one for her SUV.
5,I like that I have a rapid charger in my car it's an excellent investment if you do a lot of business while in your car
5,I like how the ports bend upwards so that the E-Brake on my car doesn't get in the way.  Also it is a good size and not to massive for all of the options.  The voltage is pretty consistent which is good when wanting to charger items.
5,Fantastic little gadget! Charged both my Galaxy s9+ and iPhone 6s perfectly. My favorite are two features: the charger pivots up and down for tight fits so it won‚Äôt get in the way of shifters or anything for that manner and Secondly the VOLTAGE METER!! AWESOME!!!
5,So good...working as promised!  Time shall tell. I'll update if any issues arise.
5,I had a  Otium FM transmitter for phone calls in my old van and it worked great for 3 years and sold it with the van because I no longer needed it . So I knew Otium was a dependable brand.  This one I needed for USB charging and wanted the cigarette ports for my GPS to plug into. Charges my phone pretty fast. Very happy with the charger.
5,I have a dash cam always on and needed another socket for charging my phone occasionally and this product fits all the requirements. The option to turn the sockets off when not used is awesome!
5,This item takes the place of 3 or 4 other accessories. I can now charge two phones RV backup camera and tablet all at the same time. The Voltage read out is very nice and I like the double switches to turn off units.

5,I am happy with this product as it served its purpose of having an extend car charger with extra USB ports and a USB C port.  Beyond that the look of the product is so elegant that it didn't ruin the interior of my car.
5,I like the sturdiness of this charger as well as all the outlets it's perfect for my altima
5,This is the second adapter I purchased.  The other was purchased 12/2019 and has operated great.  It is nice to be able to turn off each port as my GPS come on and off with the car power and this alleviates that situation.the product is well built I have had no issues and look forward to a long life.
5,Charged my cell almost twice as fast using the fast charge QC3.0. My RV GPS and my RV cameras now can be on at the same time and the fact that the devices has fuse protection give me piece of mind.
5,Great product
4,The car charger is very convenient for those who need extra USB ports to charge your phone your passenger etc. It is good for long drives and traveling for long-distance.
5,Works great. Highly recommend.
5,This is a great charger. I like the fact that it displays the battery voltage and has a USB-C port on it. I tested the USB-C port and it provides enough amperage to charge the iPhone 12 Pro Max with a MagSafe charger.
5,I have purchased several of these dual plugs for our vehicles.  I like that it has two UBS charging ports and that  the quality of this product is great best way to describe it is Heavy Duty.
5,Whats nice is you don't need to unplug it has a button to turn each side off and on
5,I have had other similar charger and they are clunky or they hum. This one has a small footprint has an on/off switch for both sides of the charger and does all that it is supposed to do. Can't beat this charger at any price.
5,Excellent product.Ordered this to use it on my road trip.The product quality looks good. Build quality is good.They also provide 2 extra fuses in case if the fuse blows up.It has two switches on top helps to switch off in case not needed.It also has a screen displaying the voltage output.
5,se ve bonito y bastante bueno por el precio.
5,Works as advertised. Delivered on time and intact. Performs as expected and the swivel head is a great feature!
5,I needed a new one. Came across this one. I look for what components are in/made with and I liked this even tho I could of ordered a cheaper one. Charging power is great and I love tht it tells you what your car battery is at when car is on and off. It's sweet.
5,We have been using this for over a year.  It has worked perfectly.  We're so happy with it we're ordering a second one for our other vehicle  Fast charges S10+ with no problems.
5,Great value for your money‚Ä¶..charges anything I plug into it!
5,this car adapter fits perfect for my 2001 TJ
5,This works perfect for my needs. I use this for plugging a flashing caution light and a dash cam in my tractor.
5,Product was extremely useful and exactly what I needed! I used it to plug in a car tracker and a rear dash cam. This solved my problem of needing another port and is as simple as plug and use!
5,This charger allows me to use my rear camera monitor and my dash camera at the same time as well as charge my phone.  Great addition to my truck.  Good buy.
3,Doesn‚Äôt fit snugly it has to be pushed else the devices don‚Äôt get powered
5,Working great. I like the individual shut-off switches. The fast charging port does work at least for the Galaxy S21.
5,I like that it fits in the center console and is flexible enough to be able to close the lid on console. It works perfect for what we needed it for. Not quiet sure what the other usb type port goes in the other spot but we didn‚Äôt need that port anyways.
5,I like this device because it helps me to change multiple devices at once.
5,I loved that I could charge multiple devices at one time. Does exactly what it describes and is super versatile as far as options to power all devices without being limited on what you can and can't do~ :^)Overall a really good product for all the functionalities that it has.
5,Perfect for my Buick.  I love the fast charger and not there's room for the kids to plug in!
5,Very impressed. Very high quality with many nice features such as the current battery voltage and independent switches to turn off either outlet. Swivel is strong as well won‚Äôt limp over with weight on it which is nice for keeping the unit in the desired position.
5,This product is what I thought it would be ! Awesome ! Super fast charging ! Great design! A lot of free ports ! I do a lot of driving for work so this device comes in clutch !
5,Using this in company truck. Charges 2 phones a tablet and runs my heated/massage chair. Good quality and swivel stays where you put it. Very happy with product.
5,I have had this for a little over a week and everything seems to be in order.  Switches work  The battery voltage is accurate and near real time the energized port shows the light on.
5,I love this charger! It has an on/off button so you don't have power going to a socket that isn't being used. It also came with 2 fuses.
3,I have had nothing but trouble from this piece of crop. The charging power is great I like it. However when I connect my Bluetooth to it it won't stay in. This product doesn't have a tight enough hole (lol) to hold anything in it. Not just a few times but rather all the time when I turn the corner my Bluetooth pops out disconnecting itself. It sucks because I have to push it back in and wait for it to reconnect like all the time. I really am frustrated with this stupid thing.
5,The feature allowing it to bend at an angle was needed to avoid the stick shift. Works great. The battery voltage readout was nice also.
5,Probably best thing I bought it might take fairly big amout of space in your car depending on what type of interior you have but still better than plugging  two charger adapters.
5,Charges very quickly. Just what I needed for iPhone Apple Watch and an old iPod I use for hiking. Even has USB C and a Q quick charging USB. Caution- I pull mine out each night because I was afraid the lighted aux sockets could discharge my car battery. Just SAYIN'
5,Really like the product
5,just what i needed work great
5,Great addition to be able to charge in transit!!  My truck only has one lighter outlet so this was a welcome and much needed addition to charge multiple accessories at once while out and about.
5,Awesome for cars with older usb charging ports or cars without any.  Using it for 6 months now still works great bought 2 more.
5,This item is great!! I love the fact that it charges multiple items all at once. I was able to charge my Iphone 11 my son's IPAD and my daughter's Iphone!! This is a great product and sold at a great price.  You can't go wrong with purchasing this!!
5,Spent over an hour at the local auto stores and could not find a splitter I liked. Then I found this one on Amazon.Pleased with the appearance and quality. The built in auto fuse holder and individual switches are plus. The blue light helps using it in the dark.
5,This item is very nice works perfectly keeps all my stuff charge and it tells me how my car battery is doing.
1,Bought this to replace a 3 slot one that one of the 3 slots had stopped working on and I really only needed 2.  The 2nd slot stopped working on day 2.  Waste of money.
5,it works and looks very nice i like the fuse built into it also That way if you over load the device you arent looking for the fuse to replace
5,Purchased for 2018 Subaru Outback
4,Works good for what I need. Great value.
5,I really like this plug it works fantastic. I use one port for my dash cam and the other for my rear view cam on my RV.. I like it also tells you how much power you are using.
4,The charger works great its just not stiff enough so the head of the charger is always dropping downit wont staybin the position you yant it to stay in
5,Great product. Finally I have a fast charger in my truck. On/off buttons are good too. If you're looking for a fast charger you need to get this!
4,Great product.
5,There's only 1 cigarette lighter in my car. I would like to use many devices at a time. Now I can use 1 navigator + 1 backup camera monitor + fast charging my phone at a time. It meets my need. Satisfied.
5,Great device. Nice to have a battery monitor and usb ports on it.
5,Very nice unit. Only issue I have is that won't stay in the turned up position with 2 chargers plugged into it. It may be too heavy for it Other than that it works perfectly
4,Works great.
5,this is an awesome car charger and charges pretty quick and highly recommend this product. worth every penny and very useful. love it and do not regret buying
5,Works great. Works as stated. Quick charge. Like the added cable.
5,like price
5,I love how fast it charges the phone and I love it tells me the voltage of my system
5,Great product works very well. Very happy that I can turn on/off each 12v outlet independently. Having 3 separate USB‚Äôs is awesome too!!
5,I needed to attach two items to my charging unit but my old car only has on outlet.  This was just what I was looking for and It does exactly what it says it will do.  Both my phone and back up camera work together perfectly.
5,I love the convince of this product. Having dual charging ports with the dual USB port and the fact that they have there own off and on button is a plus.
5,What A nice looking and useful stuff. I can use the FM transmitter and my dashcam at the same time now.
5,Great product for older vehicles with limited outlets..  Purchased another one for my 2nd vehicle. Fits great charges great.
2,Purchased this product on August 6 2020 and one side of the unit hasn‚Äôt worked for a weeks. I don‚Äôt have a lot plugged into this adapter and for one plug to go after hot even a year isn‚Äôt very good. One side still works and the USB and USB C side but that‚Äôs all. Going to get rid of this one when a name brand one comes in that I bought. Seller was willing to send a replacement with a small shipping charge but decided a better brand is probably the way to go. Charging power is ok like a slow charge.
5,Does the job. I wish it could tell when the motor turns off. So it could turn it self off. Nevertheless I like product.
5,Its nice but the internal light is useless because it is covered by the plug that you place and the light in the outlet is to show there is power to that port.It didn't arrive with extta fuses
5,I drive with a camera and Two cellphones charging. No issues at all and it works great.
5,Works great! Easy to use! Can turn on one or both ports for charging. I use it for my phone charger and dash cam.
5,Its pretty! It works great and it was fairly price.
5,I got this one for my Truck. It works great and has 2 USB quick charge and a USB c. It came with 2 extra fuse.
5,I like that it angles so it doesn‚Äôt run into the stick shift. Pretty blue light too.
5,This charger I loved the fast charge for my phone as well as the versatility I can connect my camera GPS and mobile device.
5,Good product at a decent price. Package arrived on time and in good shape.
5,I have been looking for a splitter for a long time.  This is by far the best one yet. The on and off buttons even a 3.0 USB port to fast charge my phone. Definitely and must buy.
5,nice product butt you have to remember to unplug it when leaving the auto or there will be a battery drain...
5,Galaxy phone fully charged from 23% to 100% in just 30 minutes  while my GPS was plugged into the cigarette charger socket!  Awesome!  Well worth it üòÄüëç
5,It's durable nicely designed it can be adjusted to the position you want and can monitor the voltage of the battery. The package comes with the two pieces of spare fuses. Great!!! I highly recommend this adapter!
5,Nice tight fit due to the rubber pieces on the shaft. Swivel position holds its place well too. Confirmed that the Quick Charge 3.0 port works on my Note 8.This product is great because my dash cam needs a socket because the power adapter isn't a male USB connector.
5,Great product plugs right in and works great. I have four devices hooked up and it charges right up! A must buy!
5,Yes great item just what I was looking for
5,The item description is 99.99% accurate. Cant be perfect lol. I got what was advertised and I am very pleased.
5,This charger is awesome it runs my dash cam led lights and chargers my phone like a champ. I'd recommend it to anyone!
5,My voltage gauge died in my truck and this is great to have and make sure my alternator is still working.
5,Great item to add charging outlets for a trip. Saves having to unplug and then plug in something else while traveling.
4,Charger is heavy duty and charges quickly
5,Solid charger. Was worried the hinge would be loose but not the case with this charger.  Would buy again.
5,Great product..everything you need
5,Worth it. So far works good. No issues yet. Charges fast. Reads the voltage [ I think ] and does come with the 2 extra fuses in case. Which is nice.
5,Had purchased this product for the car originally but found that it powers my front & rear dash cams so good and without problems in months...I felt to purchase another for use indoors with my 12V devices. Definitely a good buy.
5,Arrived quickly. Great dual cigarette charger with USB and usb-c ports to charge all types of phones. Looks and works great!
5,We bought it for a friend trying to improve the air conditioning in her car.  And be able to charge her phone at the same time.  Works well and she was quite impressed.
5,So far it seems to be doing a good job of charging and running whatever I plug in to it. Seems solid. Decent price
5,Best of all is you can turn off the pugged in devices without unplugging the whole unit.
5,Great addition as needed more plugs.  I like the charging display feature and flexible design.  Has 3.0 and another less charging mode but works like described.  Nice blue lights makes it easier to see.
5,Great item just what I needed for extra charging power.
1,One socket stopped working after less than 8 weeks. Used it for dash camera. Couldn‚Äôt return it bc of the closed return window. Now I‚Äôm back to just one socket. Defeats the purpose  of buying this. Don't waste your money
5,This is a nice versatile cat lighter splitter. It bends to fit many angles which helps if space is tight.
5,Excelente
4,Works as advertised.... I like the voltage readout.
5,The media could not be loaded.
4,This dual garger works great and I'm satisfied with this purchase.
5,Very accurate voltage readings. Great for my vehicles.

5,This charger is amazing and fast charging. Be it !
5,It great
5,Works perfectly! Fast charges my Samsung Galaxy S8+ with USB port and the price is right!
1,It is nice that it shows your battery voltage but one of the ports didn't work at all so it was like buying 1 port for the price of 2
5,Love this charger 2 USB chargers plus 12v outlets that have their own on/off switch and voltage readout great item.
5,Absolutely the best dc socket plug to buy.  I love the on/off switches.  This Product has it all and is very attractive and functional.  I would easily buy again.
5,I like the ports on this and that is bends because it is quite bulky due to the DC ports
5,Have only had it a couple of months but so far it works great.
5,Does what I need it to do no problems so far would highly recommend.
5,Good quality build and nice to have access to speedy recharging while driving. Angle is adjustable one plugged into socket and includes spare blade fuses if required. Overall great unit.

5,This is the best Cigarette Lighter Splitter I've found.  Has many features.

4,Super product. Would buy again

5,I bought another 9V splitter for the same money and did not work when attaching two 9V. Bought this one and attached a 9V air compressor & 9V fan. Ran no problem.
5,many futures on a small package work well.
3,Requires fuses which blow a lotWorked one full dayCheaper options available
4,Great product. Works well.
3,The 2 sockets are slightly too big just enough so that a minor tug or bump keeps knocking the chargers out of the sockets. Otherwise totally perfect.
5,Works very good . Very happy
5,I will highly recommend this product and customer service is awesome. It take about a day to respond but is because of the time difference.
5,Great fir the value would buy again
5,Works great. I really like that I can turn off what is plugged into it by using the buttons on the sockets instead of pulling the plugs.
5,Used for dash cam and GPS. Also like that I can monitor battery and alternator voltage.

5,This is a great car charger it is better than I expected for the price I really like that you can monitor the car battery charge!

5,This is perfect for charging more phones or other electronics. I love the power buttons the power gauge and the fact it tilts.
5,Best charger I‚Äôve ever owned. I like the on/off switches on each outlet so there is far less plugging and unplugging devices. A voltmeter is useful to show the health of your battery and alternator.

5,Very satisfied with this product. Works great and just as described

5,Better than expected. Love the voltage meter. Would‚Äôve paid double for it!!! Recommend!
5,Works great for what I need it to supply power to multiple devices at the same time.
1,(1) Both sockets do not make contact with my devices making it useless.(2) Have to use force to insert it into the car lighter socket -- too tight.Purchased it in 2019. Used it 2-3 times then it became useless.Do not buy it. It is a waste of money.
5,Works great!  The swivel is nice to adjust the angle and it easily powers more refrigerator and radar detector without any issues.

5,Great
5,A little bigger than I thought but very useful and it works perfectly. Very pleased with the product.
2,Indicated voltage is not accurate  ( example:  indicates 12.2 volts - but actual is 12.4 volts ).  I compared this with a known accurate VOM and four Innova battery testers I bought on Amazon :  https://www.amazon.com/INNOVA-3721-Battery-Charging-Monitor/dp/B000EVWDU0/ref=sr_1_5?crid=C4BBN666L10J&dchild=1&keywords=innova+battery+tester&qid=1631729583&sprefix=innova+battery+te%2Caps%2C1316&sr=8-5
5,It is hard to have a good quality product with descent price. This product is what I get both.
5,Amazing  charging  power reliable and fast
5,As a truck driver will use is lots of devices for work when making deliveries this has to be one of the best chargers to use
5,This was everything I needed and having the added USB ports for more charging was a great addition!

5,Have 2 in my truck powers my radiotrackertracking screen and can still charge phone
5,Works great and can be positioned as I need. Purchased two and have had no problems with either. Well worth the money. I would definitely recommend.
5,Good fast  charger. With voltage reader.
1,When I have received this car charger and opened the box I saw a card inside stating if you leave a great review this company will give you a $15 Amazon gift card. The moment I saw that I had reservations. The second that I plugged this charger into my car my radio/cd/navigation system died!!!! Then I tried starting my vehicle and it wouldn‚Äôt turn on again!!!!! It did not blow a fuse which was simple. I ended up having to get my vehicle towed and serviced to fix the damage from this piece of garbage car charger! If a product works well it will speak for itself and not a company paying people to give great reviews. Do not take the gamble. It‚Äôs not worth the financial headache.
5,Awesome product works as advertised I like the two fuses that came with it. So far I am very satisfied.
3,First time I tried was today and one side works great but couldn‚Äôt get other side to work
5,Just as advertised & expected.

5,Used the charger for GPS and phone
5,Just as it is described
1,After 10 days of use..swiveled losely; the charging tip was pushed inward so it wouldn't make good contact any longer..just after 10 days already!?  I wish to return but tossed the box and no time while OTR to return b4 window closed!
5,Works as described
2,I am using it with a Lexus and that thing keeps moving as if it is smaller than the adapter. It keeps turning off after a bump. Not built well...
5,works great. voltmeter a nice extra
1,The plug is easy to loose and needs to be pressed frequentlyÔºåtype-c charging power so weak.Can't fully charge the phone

2,The left port is larger than the right one. When you plug something in it will not charge it pops out of the socket.
2,Type C part is too powerful. Will blow your phone charging port. I just received this yesterday and just used it today and now I have to get a whole new phone. My Note 10+ charger port blown
2,Is not sturdy enough
5,üëç
2,Socket cracked after 2 weeks use...
1,I use a Bluetooth adapter to play songs from my phone through my car stereo. Using this adapter caused my Bluetooth adapter to dusing a static hissing noise over my music. I literally bought a new car antenna and was about to replace my car stereo before I figured out that this adapter was the culprit. So if you plan on using this adapter to power anything audio related do not buy it. Also if it's causing my Bluetooth adapter problems that I can hear it makes me wonder if it has the potential to harm other electronics that it's powering.
5,Works great
5,Love it
5,Good product
1,I love the design but I ordered the first one and it worked for a few months and then quit. I changed the fuses which are included and nothing. So I ordered the second one and it worked great for 6 months or so and I just happened to be using my phone and I heard a sizzling sound and it almost burned my phone up!
1,One side does not even work! Had it for 2 days and still nothing I'd like to return it .
1,I am not sure where all the five star reviews came from but I can't do it this thing is too damn thick you need serious strength to put it into the cigarette lighter and then pulling it out I feel like I'm going to break part of my car. I have a 2020 Honda Civic not recommended for this car!
2,It charged (liked) it will roll to one side if you put an extended cell phone holder in it.
1,Not exactly fast. I bought a $3...  7-eleven charger that charged in the same speed.
1,VERY WEAK! This car charger blows up fuses too fast. It will blow up your cigarette lighter fuse and it will keep blowing up the built-in A15 fuse it has. So not worth it with all the extra fuses you'll have to buy.
1,The plastic warped from heat. The plastic used in not good. I used this well within  it's power specifications. The springs won't hold the plug in now and it keeps falling out.
1,Worked for two days. Then stopped charging; then taking it out to look at it it cracked. Wasted money! Cheaply made.
2,It works but when I plugged in my two devices they felt very loose. Not at all what they feel like when they go directly into the actual lighter.
1,Everytime I plug this into my car it blows the 15a fuse in the fuse block of the care.
2,Works as it should but it puts noise in my Bluetooth fm transmitter.
1,The switch only operates the round ports only not the USB ports and the voltage display does not turn off.
1,Could not plug this in any kind of plug. Way to thick. What were they thinking when they made it?
1,I I just ordered this and used it 1 time. The follow time I went in my car to use it again one of the sockets already didn‚Äôt work. And I just purchased it. So unfortunate because I would have loved to keep it.
1,This unit is so tight it will pull your cigarette's socket out. Returning.
1,The two big charging port did not work at all
1,It arrives already registered to another email; and although the system states it will send a link to your address it won't.
1,Arrived with one of the lighter ports dead.  Returned it.
1,As soon as i put it in my cigarette lighter charger it blew! Wow! Wtf!
1,Only one port is working!Disappointed
1,went out after 2 weeks
5,Noted that this review is edited to reflect 5 stars for responsiveness and customer service. As titled this charger does not work with my (and my everyone's) Samsung A32 phone. The customer service was great. They sent me a replacement even though this was bought in Sept 2020 and it is May 2021 now. However the replacement did not charge the A32 as well. It worked for the Google Pixel and the Samsung S21. I just dont think it is compatible with the Samsung A32 which is a new phone that released this year (2021). I tried different cables different cars turning off the fast charge option etc. No luck. Customer service refunded my charges and did not want me to return the two devices. I might give it to someone who can use it.
5,Best Splitter on the Market ! Also allows you to turn the ports on and off !
5,This adapter is worth more than I paid for it even has a port for a c-charger I'm using it for charging devices and a backup camera  happy with purchase üòÄ
5,Looks good and works good so far - should do the job. Especially like the on/off switches.
5,Great product and arrived very quickly!
1,Excited to receive my item and to my surprise as I opened the box there was no charger. Only the spare fuse was inside.
5,Problem solved! I have a GPS and an FM transmitter both of which use a cigarette plug instead of a USB. Obviously the only solution was a dual socket car charger. This product took care of the simultaneous connections without any electrical issues.  Each socket also has its own on/off switch so you do not have to unplug the entire charger after use. Take note that in some car models the cigarette socket is continuously on even after shutting off the ignition and pulling out the key. So the independent on/off switches solve that common issue with other vehicle models.The car battery voltage level indicator is also a big plus as it can alert you to any impending issues with your  vehicle's electrical/charging system.With these features plus more this is the perfect necessary accessory for your vehicle.
5,My car only has one cigarette lighter which makes it hard to run a dash camera and charge my phone at the same time. The Otium 2 socket cigarette lighter adapter has fixed that problem. It changes my single cigarette lighter into a dual port cigarette lighter. The additional charging ports (QC USB Type C and USB) are extremely useful. The head can be positioned in an angle that makes easy access of the ports. The two sockets can be individually turned on and off if you don't need one to be active. Although it is a little bit more expensive than other car chargers it seems more reliable and it comes with replacement fuses. I'm extremely satisfied with this car adapter and accessories. Worth it!
3,this charget must be plugged into your car‚Äôs cigarette lighter socket before you turn on the car. its fuse will blow if it is plugged in after the car has been turned on. the fuse is very difficult to take out and you need a sharp needle-shaped pick to ply it off. it runs about 13-14 amps when plugged in a cigarette lighter socket with a 15 amp fuse. so far it is working fine with one cigarette snd 2 usb cables plugged in. haven‚Äôt yet tested if it can withstand 5 devices plugged in at once (with 2 iphone 7 and one dashcam plugged in it‚Äôs already drawing a little bit over 14 amp).
1,Already returned poor Quality
1,Tried to use in the Subaru to inflate two SUP. Blew the fuse the first time. So stopped using it and using just the Subaru plug in the front and other in back. Not as convenient but works.
5,Updated review. This has very good features and is of great value. The first one sent was a bit loose in the cigarette lighter socket but customer service sent a replacement that fit much better. I highly recommend this product.
4,I was going to buy a new fuse for the earlier model of this car charger but the fuse was going to cost $6.  I figured I'd be better off just buying this newer model since the price is so low.Works as well as the last one with the same fault. Once I plug in the GPS the head droops down covering the cup holder.  I might try duct taping it to stay in an upright position.
5,I bought a few other car chargers in the past but this one is by far the best.The voltage screen is convenient so you know when you car battery is dying (lower than 12V).It has all of the output you‚Äôll probably need USB for dash cam another USB and a USB type C to charge phones and tablets and 2 extra outlets to connect other electronic devices like backup a camera monitor an air compressor to fill up your car tires or an electric jack. I‚Äôll buy it again in the future.
2,This looked like a great item and seems to be well made and sturdy. But it did not work for my purposes which was to avoid drawing power from a DC socket that stays ON after my car is turned off. So instead of having to pull my GPS power cord out of the socket when I shut down the car I was hoping to leave this unit plugged in and use the on/off switches.  Unfortunately the power readout stays ON so it is still drawing power from my car's battery even though both sockets are turned off.
5,This charger is AWSOME!  It works perfect for what I needed. I can now fast charge my phone and run my dash cam at the same time and then turn off my dash cam with a push of a button. Smaller than I thought so that was a plus. The battery level indicator is very cool. Buy it you won't regret it!
5,I have a radar detector and a dash camera in my car that both required a cigarette lighter plug. Unfortunately I only have one available and I have needed two plugs. This adapter allows for both and it regulates the power. Great device at an even better price.
4,Good one able to charge multiple devices  it would have been great if it has matt finish ...satisfied
4,This product did what it said.  I like having the 2 sockets AND USB ports. I like that it is lit up so you know that it is on and charging.  The only thing is that I wish that it could be bent a little further.  Where my gear shift is and where my socket is to put it is pretty tight but I can't really do anything about that.
5,an amazing products. high quality for what your paying for. fast shipping and comes well packed.
4,Sometimes it disconnects the power for sole reason. Otherwise it‚Äôs good. I might got a faulty one.
5,Product arrived on time and in working order. Life saver for older car with no USB ports.
5,Thank you!!
4,Love it!
5,So far it's holding up well with my Bluetooth connector and dash cam. Definitely a great purchase that I really needed!
5,Great product!
5,I am very impressed with my 2-socket car charger! I plan on using it more often when I start going back into the office but in the meantime it‚Äôs still useful. My husband and I can charge both of our phones and I‚Äôm thinking of even getting a small heating blanket that can be plugged into this as well! (I used to have a car that had heated seats but I‚Äôve since bought an older vehicle and the heating blanket will have to be the next best thing!) I appreciate that it has different charging options and that you can angel it to fit best.
5,Being able to use extra socket adapter and usb plugs for additional items.
5,Can‚Äôt go wrong by purchasing this item. Worth every dime!
5,On and off switches for each side
5,I love this product. It helps out a lot. It lets me charge 3 things at a time while in the car
5,Works great
5,awesome product nice design u get what‚Äôs the value of the product the charging power it gives to my car accessories are great
5,Super fast and super convenient I highly recommend!!!!
5,My primary reason for buying this product was due to it having a USB-C port on it for high speed charging as well as the dual power outlets for my radar detector and for another accessory power item. So far its worked great my phone charges quickly when driving and being able to turn the accessory outlet ports is a great feature so I don't have to disconnect things and leave them dangling. The display of the battery voltage is a nice feature although not necessary.
5,Excellent...
5,I love the on/off option for each socket. Don‚Äôt have to worry about my truck battery and I don‚Äôt have to unplug from the socket each time. The two USB ports are a bonus. The digital voltage readout for what it‚Äôs worth is a nice feature. If you need a dual 12 v plug get this one.
5,This works great for charging my phone. On the 20 minute ride to work it will take my phones charge from 20% to 100%. The factory charger takes twice that time.I use it to also run my dash cam and rear view/back up camera. The LED make sure I don't forget to shut it off and the two on/off buttons make that easy.Worth it.
5,I needed a new faster port in the car to charge my new phone. This fit the bill nicely. It will charge my phone at about 1% a minute roughly which is about the same as the charger that came with the phone itself and will give a decent amount of power in the 20-30 mins I'm usually in the car. It has already made itself very useful.
5,I purchase this charger because I needed dual cigarette outlets. I got a bonus with the dual USB ports and another port that I‚Äôm not sure what it is forüòÅ. I‚Äôm sure I will figure it out one day. I am really happy with my dual charger and the extra fuses to go along with it. It looks really nice in my vehicle. I think it‚Äôs on the classy side. I would order it again.
1,its loose keeps unplugging.
5,Does exactly what I wanted.. and I don't have a bunch of cords..
5,Excellent product. High quality.
5,This is really good to charge my phone and keep my after market rearview camera working. It is slightly bulky so you have to remember to check if it is still plugged in. Overall a good deal.
5,I have a lot of accessories in my car that requires power but there is only 2 power outlet and of them is not in the most convenient spot. This allowed me to have 2 additional outlets plus 2 USB ports right where I wanted it to be. Had it for several months now and it is still working fine.Definitely a must-buy for your car.
5,Looks and functions exactly as I'd hoped for besides one small issue the weight of the two devices I have plugged in makes the charger bend/fold downwards. I even added some electrical tape around it that helped for a few days but then started to droop downwards again so wish it had stiffer joints. Still works and functions great.
5,Looking very beautiful. Charging more than one device at the same time. Fast charging.  The best choice
5,Using this in my 2006 Miata that has only one power outlet. Now I can charge my phone and still have 12 volt outlet for my GPS or any other 12 volt accessary. Charger length and adjustment makes it easy to adjust the angle so it can clear the console.
5,Only con is it‚Äôs a little bulky.  BUT it does what it says it does and does it well.  Seems to be made well & the digital output meter is a cool feature.
5,Perfect for what I needed. The two Cigarette lighter ports are great for my backup camera and lights. I love the QC port to quickly charge my wireless charger. I would recommend this.
5,Great car charger! Kind of bulky but worth it! Highly recommend!
5,I bought this product for the need of a dual socket outlet. What I like is that you can individually turn off one or both of the outlets while still being plugged in. The soft blue illumination is pretty cool too. Overall I would recommend this it‚Äôs a great value for your money.
5,This dual port was perfect for our trip to use for multi things.  We had a garmin and was able to charge multiple phones. And fast charging. It‚Äôs a little bulky but does move everyday to accommodate. Definitely worth it for us.
5,Overall I appreciated this product for being compact as well as snug in the lighter port since many of these devices tend to have janky connections. Additionally I appreciate having the Type-c direct connection as well as the battery readout information. The only thing its missing is a Bluetooth-to-radio adapter for older cars!
4,This product works great and i received it on time. I would recommend anyone to buy this  charging port.
4,The material is very well designed for the money I am using it for my phone and gps
5,Love the two USB ports duel cigarette lighter ports and C-cable port.....allows me to plug in my phone bluetooth adapter and LED strip lights all at the same time. It also looks very sleek and cool and has a digital display. Well worth the money!
5,Excellent quality  sturdy and well constructed.  It functions just as described.  Will definitely recommend it to friends.  You can't go wrong a this product.
4,Works well. Very firm. But the quick charge 3.0 port didn't work well when I was using 2 of the USB ports at the same time.Very well packaged.
5,This charger is so worth the price. I don‚Äôt know why I waited to purchase one that could charge multiple devices at once. I did my research and this has received good reviews. It is very sturdy gives a quick charge and is nicely designed.
5,Great value
5,better way to choose which and when to supply power to........
2,The only thing i hate about this product that when you plug in position sometimes it retract out position  especially if it sits upright. At times won't stay in charger slide out. It became aggravation to me to keep playing with it just to keep my devices charge in my vehicle. Find something else other than this.
5,This lighter adapter has many options for power.  It has the QC3.0 fast charge standard 2.4 A charge USB C and two lighter sockets as well.  This unit is well built and looks great.
5,Good value
5,works great just what I needed
5,Very nice and works well
5,Nice little power house! Provides great power in multiple types of connections. Feels very well built and it stays where I put it.
5,Though a bit bulky for my dash layout I love it. The qc3.0 charged really fast.
5,Love everything
5,Exactly what i was looking for. Small compact design removes all the clutter..üëç
5,I had gone through a few similar products that seemed cheap and poorly made.This charger has worked flawlessly.All USB ports work just as they should and the lighter ports work just as well.
5,It's fancy and has a lot of convenient features!
5,Great product.  Looks like a quality charger and is working well.
5,Always on the move so i need a quick charge in a short amount of time this works!!!!!
5,It was exactly as described.  One location under dash to charge all accessories.
5,Great charger for the price! Can easily charge multiple devices and power my dash cam all in one!
5,Best charger ever.
5,Love having multiple charging systems for items.
5,This is a great product. I love that you are able to plug things in plus have the outlets to put a cord in.
5,Good!!
5,Amazing quality! Charges very quickly!
5,Love the voltage output meter the LED lights & fast charging
5,Very good car  charger üëç
5,Best of all
5,Work great .
5,Not bad
5,good
5,Good quality
5,worked very well for our purpose
5,Its works
5,Looks good and works well
5,I liked that I could plug two devices in at the same time.
5,Works Great!  Love it!!
5,Bought it for a gift.
5,Works great
5,Works really good. Have not had any problems with it so far. Charges fast gives a nice live power reading and has more ports than you‚Äôll probably ever use.
4,Bought it for a long drive. Needed something to charge my portable GPS unit and a radar detector.  Had to really shove it into the cigarette lighter before it would properly work and started to power both devices.  Once I did so it would then properly work.  Can‚Äôt really attest to its longevity though.  Once i finished my drive I stopped using it.  I‚Äôm not sure how it would stand up under long term daily use.
5,I gives me the extra power outlets that I need.  I like the battery voltage readout as well.
5,An excellent vehicle outlet extender with multiple device powering options - so good I purchased a second one for my other vehicle
5,This car charger comes with LED metter 2 socket cigarette ports. Also it has a USB -C and 2 USB A so this should cover all the phone when it comes to charging.i like this product a lot! Good buy.
3,Built cheap but good
5,Love the quick charge option and having the ability to keep track of my battery voltage. Bought 2
4,With 2 12v ports 2 USB-A and one USB-C ports this can address all but the most extreme charging needs.
4,work great but its hard to adjust (there's no way to keep it upstrait)
5,This thing is great for cars that have one or two 12 volt plugs. This has a 15 amp fuse in it I have ran two cell phones off the USB ports GPS on the 12 volt socket and a coolatron cooler at 4 amps on the second 12 volt socket. Does not get hot
5,This works great.
5,Car Charger
5,So my Problem that I had was how was I  going to Power my Cobra Radar Detector My Dash Cam and still Charge my Cellphone and Bluetooth Device Head Set all at the Same time if needed! And of Course my Passenger wants to Charge her Cellphone to especially on long Road Trips! Well my issue was Solved with this 1√ó2 Splitter Adapter! Now I can Power my Radar Detector Dash Camera and Charge my Cellphone all at the Same time! And on Top of all that my Cellphone is Fast Charging Capable! Which this Car Cigarette Lighter Charging Port Adapter puts out enough Volts and Amps to Charge my Cellphone at the Accelerated rate that it was designed for! And it Charges my Phone in Half the Time that a Standard 5.0 Volt 1.55  Amp Cellphone Charging Block will do! So it's a Win Win Situation for me and my Passenger to! I really like the Feature of it having an inline Fuse for Surge Protection and to Prevent any Damage to my Devices being Charged or Powered by this Unique Charging/Power Adapter and Splitter! I originally bought one for my SUV because it had a Radar Detector and a Rear View Back up Camera that I added myself! And I liked it so much that I Bought another one for my Sedan! I am very Happy with the Good Quality of this Charging/Power Adapter and the Price was much lower than I was expecting to pay! I would Recommend this to a Friend for sure!
5,I put it to the test I drove across  country and I had all the charging ports working at once and it handle it
5,I have not a single complaint at all. Hit exactly what was advertised and it charges my phone fast. I got this originally cause I needed two 12v outlets due to I needed one for my dash cam and the other to plug in my USB charger by the way I don't need now that it has two USB ports and a C port which is really awesome in my book. Then there's the two port on/off button on top so you can turn them off if your not using them I know their not necessary but hey I like the option. I do highly recommend buying this product to anyone if you need the 2 12v ports.My opinion is unsolicited or paid for by anyone so you are getting a real honest review from me. I hope this review helps you.
5,I utilize it to power my self installed backup camera power self installed Bluetooth speaker for cell phone and charge mobile device. It is working great and gets job done. Btw I have 2007 sedan.
5,we brought this to replace one that quit working great price and we like the fact that it has off and on buttons for each side.
3,Don‚Äôt like that when you plug two C connectors in the product doesn‚Äôt have the strength to hold them up so your item stays straight.
5,Very good quality product good feature. Like the control button.
5,This is my second one. Have one in both of my trucks & they have been working great.
5,Current product under review as per seller's own product description of its Amazon marketing page: Car Charger 150W 2-Socket Cigarette Lighter Splitter QC 3.0 Dual USB Ports 1 USB C Fast Car Adapter with Separate Switch LED Voltmeter Replaceable 15A Fuse for GPS/Dash Cam/Phone/iPad.This is a product I ordered as a replacement for a verifiable previously bought Amazon product that revealed a serious product flaw I could no longer accept.  Unfortunately for me this prior product's return "window" had expired and so I had to "eat it." Allow me to explain.This dual-socket automobile cigarette lighter adapter replacement has proven to be "manna-from-heaven" for me - - at least from my auto's practical usage standpoint. Why do I say this?  Because all the in-car appliances I insert into either of the two female adapter sockets STAY IN THE INSERTED POSITION once I push them in - - even over rough terrain!  Even though the prior unusable referenced unit did electronically function OK IT NEVER STAYED IN PLACE and always popped out whenever I inserted any device into it.  I hit on this wonderful replacement version as a result of the excellent seller's Amazon lengthy and informative webpage. In that description the vendor "mercifully" (for me) included the mention that his product includes no less than a simple rubber ring insert solution at the base of each female socket. In this manner any inserted 12V electronic device will stay in its fully inserted position (until physical manual removal of course) Ingenious solution to such a major problem for me for sure - - and yet so elementary and basic in logic..... so unfathomable to me why the prior seller couldn't figure out to include such a practical little -or -no- cost inclusion in his device. Simply stated the pressure created by the rubber insert grips the head of the inserted device whereby it "permanently" holds it in place.Not only is this recent replacement purchase performing so well in my car it's so cosmetically beautiful along with its other cool functions - - such as the cool nighttime illumination (that all my passengers marvel at) the dual USB hi-speed charger ports (along with the extra type "C" charger port for a total of three in all) and the ever so "cool" large digital LED automobile main battery monitoring status display.This thing's a total winner therefore my glowing 5 star rating in all the above-referenced categories.
5,Small but very good and powerful
5,Great product works well so far. Great value for the reasonable price
5,worked good for traveling still using it
5,Never enough USB ports around when you need them! This helps.I have the earlier version which has worked flawlessly for me over a couple years.* I like the ability to turn off the lighter socket.* I like the swivel feature.* They hold plugs in snug like bugs in a rug.* The visible voltage is OK to be aware of but is yet another current draw. Mind you I am using it in a motor home where the engine is not running all the time and it uses battery.* I like that they give you extra fuses.On this "new" updated  version:** I really like the increased capacity (up from 10 to 15 amps) - including extra fuses.** The USB C outlet is a bonus (but I have nothing in my technologically challenged life yet that uses USB C for power).Possible Cons?:~ The splitter does stick out from the onboard cigarette lighter receptacle about 3 inches. Although it swivels at a fair angle (30 > 45 degrees?) it still might be in the way for some folks uses.Overall this is a functional splitter / switch / charger that makes life a bit easier and convenient for using electronic gizmos and gadgets in a car or RV.
3,This product is good and fast charging port and normal port is working as described and the voltage shown is also correct have cross checked with a multimeter. However this does not properly fit my cigratte lighter and instead protrudes a bit out of the socket it works but not snug fit.
5,Nice splitter
5,High quality product. This product was purchased to replace a similar product that was wearing out. This product is much better made and expect it to last much longer than the one replaced (different brand). Enjoy all the extra features which comes with this one such as the socket on and off switches. The voltage meter is accurate.
5,My iPad wasn't charging with the USB adapter I was using but now it changes even with the screen at max brightness.
5,GREAT TO HAVE AN EXTRA CHARGING PORT I HAVE 2 OF THESE 1 FOR EACH CAR
5,I love it
5,Works great looks Great
5,Good quality. Would buy again
5,I‚Äôm buying a second one money well investLo recomiendoDinero bien invertido
5,Left side not work.
5,This maybe a little premature because I have only had two of these for only three weeks. However so far they have been working fabulously. I love the the on/off button on the units.I'm using one of these units to power up two heated seat covers that I purchased here on Amazon. No issues.
5,Worth the money
1,Great product
5,I liked that it has a voltage meter and a on/off button for the cigarette plugs.
5,Exactly what I needed
4,I have never loaded it up but it works great wit two loads
5,thanks
5,Some European cars have a cigarette lighter socket that is wider than typical American or Japanese cars.  The Otium C46 ships with a rubber shim.  Nothing about this in Amazon's blurb.  Add the shim to the plug that goes into the cigarette lighter (pretty self-explanatory) insert the plug into the lighter DO NOT TWIST and you are in business.  If you happen to own a 1978 Porsche 930.You may find that the connection from receptacle to plug is somewhat unstable even with the shim and that disconnect happens over bumps or significant acceleration/decelerations/lateral Gs.  Try adding a circle or two of electrical tape to the splitter just under where the shim goes so that the shim fits over it.  Makes connection much tighter.  Once again insert splitter straight into receptacle.  If you need to change orientation DO NOT TWIST.  Remove plug and reinsert at desired orientation.Only remaining problem is that plug receptacles on the splitter are too narrow to accept the stock Porsche lighter element.  But for you smokers I'm sure most generic or American or Japanese lighters would fit.
5,I really like this device. I now can plug in two DC devices with the cigarette style plug. And then it has two USB-A and one USB-C outlets that cover most of my electronic needs. And the voltage is very handy to make sure you don‚Äôt draw down your battery.I notice the voltage was getting low constantly which led me to replace my car battery just in time.The fit and finish is great. It seems to be of high quality and durable. I highly recommend this product.
5,The unit works great. It allow to adjust the power output to work with my dashcam power requirement. Now I have flexibility for various plugs. Love it!
5,Works wonders
4,Does a good job so far.
5,it works
5,Perfect for splitting the power to multiple devices. Also has built in on off switches for both outlets.
5,Very convenient for me because I drive an older truck without contemporary charging options. So far so good!
5,Esta bueno para el auto
5,Good!
5,Works likes it‚Äôs supposed to
5,Great
5,Quality product.
5,Fits well switches work well Voltage gauge very nice!
5,Great price good quality
5,This is a great product. It works great has lots of features and looks great too. It feels durable and well built. I think it is a great value for the money. Not only can you plug in two 12 volt plugs you can also charge up to 3 devices at the same time! And it shows the battery voltage. I did not fill all the plugs with devices to see if the voltage changes but if your battery is good I doubt this product will have any problem charging anything you plug in to it. I use this for the 12 volt plug in the back seat of my car to run some LED lights and I would order one for the front but my shifter gets in the way. Great product. Well worth the price
4,The front part of the charger is too long and it's a little loose because it can't fully blend with the car.
5,I like the look of it especially the digital battery draw readout in amber that is nice; also just the shape of it and easy access to plug and charge numerous items. Nice low blue lights.I really like it!5 stars *****
5,A very versatile car charger and much better then the last one I bought. At least this one stays in the cigarette lighter & it's not intermittent for charging devices. Great design and features! Would highly recommend!
5,Works as advertised. Very pleased with purchase. I would highly recommend this product.
5,Gracias por el producto
5,Product is as described. I needed an extra charging port in my new car. This charger has 2 cigarette lighter ports 2 USB ports and a type C port. I also like that there are off buttons for unused ports. It is a little bulky but thats expected with so many ports.
5,Great
5,Awesome splitter ... love the option of turning on or off a single port ... will buy again for my wife's vehicle
5,Well made and provides plenty of options for charging attached devices. After several months use it is still working great -- no problems and good charging power.
