5,This was my second attempt at getting a large monitor for my workstation at home and I’m very satisfied with my purchase thus far (1 month in). The resolution is perfect for work - I work in spreadsheets slides and emails all day and I can do it all easily on this monitor fitting multiple windows comfortably on the screen. Colors look great to me. No speakers but for the price seems appropriate. I also really like how flat and sleek the base is; it doesn’t take up too much space on my desk though the monitor still sits a few inches from the wall because of the base like how most work. It’s nothing too fancy but really looks better than some pricier ones I considered both in terms of graphics and overall physical look. Definitely recommend this one! Good size for working from home. I imagine it would be sufficient for light gaming too and plan to hook up some of my systems in the future.
4,I purchased this monitor as an eternal display for my iMac.  It said it would work to 4k but it simply has no Mac drivers.  I like the monitor it works on Windows but do not get this if you want an external display for a Mac or iMac.  I run it at 1080p for the best image quality but honestly I could have purchased an old 99.00 dollar monitor for the same thing.
5,This has been a great monitor connected to my 2015 Macbook Pro (not sure what another reviewer was talking about this works fine with my Macbook). I also used this for an Xbox One the 4k picture was excellent the only downside was that the monitor has no speakers so you either have to use a headset connected to your controller or digital to analog audio converter that you can plug headphones into. At the current price this is a great value (40% off of what I paid in 2020) 28" is nice too for a little more screen real estate than the standard 27" screens.
5,Very good value for the screen size and picture quality. Been using this monitor for about two months. It's working great.
5,Most reviewers below said they can't get 4k resolution.  The main issue is your PC/Mac can handle 4k resolution and the adapter/HDMI cable is 4k capable.I had the issue with the HDMI adapter and I wasn't getting 4k resolution.  Once I switched to a different one I got a fantastic 4k resolution.
4,I'd use this monitor for my daily work and dancing connected with my switch. Everything is good until last night I found there is no speaker for this monitor so I have to only follow the image when dancing - pretty awkward I have to say. :(
5,I have bought 4 of these monitors for myself and my team.  They are excellent monitors for the money and would recommend
5,This works perfectly well for my work. I have not used it for gaming or otherwise. With remote working this should suit anyone's need to use it for work.
5,Very clear and sharp picture
5,Love it! Don't play games so can't comment on gaming performance. Excellent as a video or photo editing monitor with very accurate color reproduction.  Can't beat the price vs. performance. Three inputs allow usage with multiple devices.
5,Easy to set up and great Pic Quality
5,Using a MacBookPro(2021) to drive two of these monitors.  Excellent picture quality. Easy setup.
5,Had to turn off msaa on newer games but it makes old games look great and makes new games look amazing
4,Good display a bit on the heavy side.
5,Great price
2,I have setup many 4k monitors with different Windows 10 PCs. I ordered this because it was advertised as 4K resolution (meaning 3840 x 2160) but Windows only recognizes this as 2560 x 1600 maximum. I've tried all HDMI inputs and used certified 4K cables but yet it only shows up in Windows Display Settings as 2560x1600. The frame rate is set to 59.97.  I chatted with HP tech support and they had no idea other than to try different cable or try on another PC (which I did). Very disappointed in this product that has the HP brand label.
5,this screen is awesome - I've bought 4 now!!! BUT be sure your graphics can drive a true 4K most are saying 4K compatable but only produce 1024 output... BE SURE YOU HAVE 4K which is really 3070 but is still amazing!!!
2,If you are looking for a side monitor this is the worst choice. Even as a primary monitor 1% shift in viewing angle causes horrible distortion. There are so many better 4k monitors for a few bucks more. Returned after 3 seconds of it being on.
2,Horrible viewing angles even viewing it directly in front of me it is not even good enough for casual web browsing. If I didn't know otherwise I would've said this monitor was simply FHD 1920x1080 (yes I made sure the graphics card settings were correctly set to 4K). It's a total waste of human and planetary resources to produce such a substandard piece of technology.
5,I bought 2 of these and have them both connected to a HP Z-Book laptop through a HP USB-C/A docking station.  Easily driving both at full 4K resolution (3840 x 2160) with crisp clear results.  Setup was straight forward and simple.  Very Satisfied with this product.
1,I connected it with DisplayPort and HDMI to a Mac a Windows 10 machine and a brand new 4k-compatible docking station and none could drive it at over 2560. Yet that Windows 10 machine has been driving an LG 4K monitor for a couple years without difficulty. Returning.
5,It's a good monitor for the price. wish it had a camera for conferencing
1,This monitor failed after two months of use.  Amazon was no help in getting it replaced.
1,To use this monitor you will need a higher graphics card to support the 4k. I bought it to use with my work laptop which only goes to 1920x1080 resolution the text was very blurry. I returned it
5,Upgraded from 23" monitors to these for my home office and they are great! Easy on the eyes.
1,I have read the other reviews.  Some are saying it is *not* a 4K monitor some are claiming that it *is* a 4K monitor.  I am going to throw my hat solidly in the *NOT 4K* ring.  Using a 2 year old HP Elitebook 850 G6 with provided HP G4 Hub connected with provided USB-C cable and power supply... then connecting to this monitor with provided DisplayPort or HDMI cable and power cord-- I was *NOT* able to achieve full 3840x2160 resolution.  Best I could do was 2550x1600. Using the same setup but replacing with a Samsung LU28E590DS/ZA 28" 4K monitor I *AM* able to achieve the full 3840x2160 resolution.  I don't believe my hardware is the issue.  I believe the monitor simply is not what it claims to be.
1,Not 4k as described
1,I tried with one hp and one lenovo laptop and both have black boarders at up and down sides. The max resolution is only 2560x1600. Also tried on one macbook no black boarder but the max resolution is still only 2560x1600. Don't buy this if you are not sure you can get the 4k resolutions. Returned already and wasted time!
5,Great for photography  at a reasonable price
2,It is nice however it is an older panel type and can not be viewed at different angles without it distorting the picture. Would be good if you're going to be staring at it straight on.
1,Cannot run 4K.
1,I couldn’t return it in time.  Otherwise I would not keep it. Not worth the money
4,At least 1 review here says that this monitor is not 4k. Not true. I have personally run this monitor on a 2016 MacBook at 4k and on a Surface Pro 7 at 4k.I sympathize with the mistaken reviewer -- getting this monitor to run 4k was tough. I needed a dedicated cable for the Mac (anker) and a MS-branded hub for the Surface. Other hubs and adapters wanted to output 4k at 30Hz but this monitor wants 60Hz.The monitor itself is not flashy. No gloss screen to "really appreciate" the hi res; and the side view sharpness is not superb (but not garbage either) ... that said for a single operator in front of the monitor it is a well worth the low price to put 4k on your desktop.Color fidelity is very good; brightness is very good; contrast could be better (my tray at the bottom of my pc screen is dark gray instead of black). Generally this monitor is short of the best but darn good.Physical stability is good. No height adjustment but the screen tilts.One review complains about the back mounted bottom aiming ports ... no big deal - the monitor has two hdmi ports and one DP ... and it auto-senses what's active so you can just plug everything in and forget it.One gripe -- no speakers -- tho it does have a headphone jack (which my Surface recognizes for independent control). Normally I would not worry about speakers (my pc and mad have their own speakers and any speaker that you put in a monitor is likely to be not-great) -- but hey this is 28 inches and 4k ... put a fire stick or chromcast into this thing and you have a TV - so for my old fire stick I am forced to headphone-jack out to my bluetooth speaker with a volume control. Not ideal.But as a monitor who cares about speakers? And for the price it is a very serviceable 4k solution.
1,This monitor has no positive points other than being low price. The panel itself seems to be of super low quality and one of the two started flickering right out of the box randomly. I also had to go through and basically try to calibrate it myself since the colors were all washed out from the factory. I returned it and I recommend you just don't buy it in the first place.
1,False Resolution:  It is Not 3840 x 2160 but it is 2560 x1600No support: They do not offer any phone support and in the booklet only have the South American countries' numbers.  I managed to find one US number in the booklet Virgin Island and they put me in contact with the US she asked for the serial number and then they hang up. I tried to call back the only Robo.I bought this in a flash sale at Staple for $250 but i returned it 3 days later as it is not worth $80  even. Low res.User Unfriendly: all bottoms are underneath and you have to guess and figure the thing out almost like you are in the dark.Poor Design: Beside bottoms under the belly it has a plastic-ish black banal look with no design.
5,Meets my needs
5,Great 28" 4k monitor which alone is better than having two separate 27" 1920 × 1080 monitors.  the HP monitor itself is bright and sharp and easy on your eyes.
5,I used to live on a boat where I got spoiled by a relatively large monitor.This is large enough that I can sit at a comfortable distance tweak the screen size to 150 or other enlarged percentage use the full 3480x2160 pitch for micro-clarity and bang away on my keyboard but still see everything I need.It's got both HDMI for when I use it as a clone against the laptop's small screen and DisplayPort for use with my new compact desktop computer inputs which means I get the best resolution possible.I have not taken the time yet to read the not-included manual but there's a mini-jack on the back as well; I'm guessing it's for speakers or perhaps a headset.So far I like it a LOT and Amazon's price handily trumped everyone else' - Prime made it come swiftly too!
4,Good monitor. Not the highest end but for the price it's quite good. You would have to spend a lot more to get a little better. The colors were pretty accurate right out of the box. I only made minor adjustments. I'm not in the bleeding edge of gaming but it performs well with what I do play.
5,Works as i expected. Good for the price
5,I'm using this for photo work and it performs quite well. I Spydered it and it turned out to be pretty much on the money. I'm now a 4K fan. Wouldn't go back. Only niggle: the screen text on drop down menus etc. is now smaller.
1,Really dissapointed
5,Bought it to extend my desktop works well for the price.I wish switching inputs was a bit faster you need to cycle through all of them and it takes more than a few seconds for the monitor to identify and sync to the signal or realise that theres nothing there. However its a minor annoyance. If I needed to do that every day or multiple times a day I would probably look for a different monitor. If you never need to do that and only want to use a single input theres no reason not to consider this monitor.
4,Got this monitor on sale good quality.Bought it to extend my desktop to make double monitor setup at 4K.With my main pc is working as expected at full 4K resolution 3840 x 2160 at 60hz.When I tried to use it on my mini pc Windows only recognizes this monitor as 2560 x 1600 maximum. I used the same cable as on the main pc.I guess the issue is because the mini pc video card can provide only 3840 x 2160 at 30hz.Beware if you video card doesn't provide full 4K resolution 3840 x 2160 at 60hz that can be a problem and monitor will work only as 2560 x 1600 maximum.Disappointed that the HP doesn't provide the information if monitor can operate at full 4K resolution at 30Hz.
1,Bought one for $301.95 CAD. Noticed on day 1 that the screen would occasionally flicker or the brightness would jump up then fade down. There were also vertical stripes often quite faint but sometimes they'd be straight-up glitchy as if the screen were made of skinny corduroy.I requested a replacement which turned out to have the exact sames issues so I sent it back and went for another product. As an aside they received the return a day late and charged me a $60 fee >:|During all this I noticed the price on this item fluctuate every week or so (it's currently $340.60). I think they were trying to offload defective or previously returned units to unsuspecting customers or something.
5,Got it fast and worked beautifully out of the box after easy setup. Would buy again
5,Camera de surveillance
1,This monitor is wack. The gamma and brightness are completely off even after installing the calibration information available on HP's website for this specific monitor. Worse yet mine came with a dead pixel which is SUPER noticeable. I thought maybe it would go away but it has not yet. For the price I paid for this monitor I fully expected something that was not only a good value but also worked well. This does not.EDIT: April 12 2021. After class I put my computer to sleep mode and lay down gaining a bit of energy to continue during exam time. I wake up ready to write my final papers and exams. Screen is messed up. I think I just got a bad panel.
