5,I installed on this on my Stick Up Cam outside on the side of my house.  I decided to not use the included mount but instead use the siding clips that hook into the siding and leaving the panel flat on the side of the house.I must say this solar panel is super sensitive to light that the Camera status charges in the morning and dusk.  The panel does not need direct sunlight to charge the camera.  My camera maintains 99-100% battery life with above average motion recording in my driveway. I must mention that I use the 14minute snapshot feature plus 60seconds of record time on motion and Frequently read motion without down time.  Generally these features will ruin your battery life. But this this panel it's been a trooper.  To a point that I've considered to purchase another one for my other camera. I just need a spot to put it without making my house look too ridiculous.
5,remember the days of solar power calculators?  I bought the security camera then later the solar panel to discover a better performance than just the battery.Simply find the sunny side of the house screw in the mount to the wall setup the solar panel and connect to the Ring security camera.Worry free and strong considering another one for a later project.
5,Easy to install and I don't have to climb a ladder as often if ever.
5,We are using these with Ring stick up cams and they always keep the battery at 100%. Would definitely buy again.
5,Bought this instead of the ring solar panel to save few dollars and its works perfect.
5,Great product. No complss as internet at all.
4,No battery worries  easy install Get one and don’t worry about unexpected guests
5,This camera is okay but not as good as the normal outdoor wired cameras. I don’t think I would order another one like this one. I love my other out door ring camera’s.
5,I connected it to the ring battery cam. The battery is always at 100% because of the sun.
5,I have this hooked up to my ring spotlight cam. Keeps it charged up so I don’t have to worry about swapping batteries in and out
5,Hard to find things that work with the ring camera that aren’t made by ring. These work perfectly. Ordered 3. All 3 perform as expected. Have had them almost a year and no complaints so far. Held up to various kinds of weather.
5,Easy installation and works as I had hoped-no longer need to get on a ladder to do battery recharges. This is east facing
5,Works great easy to install
5,My battery "Ring" camera now always shows 100%.  I have three Ring Solar panels they also provide me the same result.  That is a twenty dollars different with the same result you need the only I don't know which one can last longer. But for now I am happy with the performance.
5,So far been keeping ring outdoor camera battery charged.Paired it up with gutter clamp attachment for no screw install.
5,I don’t have to bother my son or grandson to come over and charge the battery anymore.
5,This solar panel looks good and seems solid. It's cheaper than the 'Ring' branded solar panel. The panel seems of good quality it plugged into my Ring stickup cam no problem and has been keeping it charged. I like this actually better than the one offered by ring because the angle of the panel has more adjustment capabilities than theirs.
5,Product looks identical to the ring panel. Works great and brought my battery to 100% in a few hours. Great product. Easy to install and well designed.
5,Performs as advertised.
3,I purchased this solar panel for my Ring battery spotlight cam back in August 2021.  I didnt install it until September 2021 but after install it was great.  The cams battery would drop to 80% overnight but would recharge to 100% by noon.  Unfortunately in August 2022 the solar panel stopped charging.  I removed the battery and removed the solar panel connection from the cam and then inserted the battery and solar panel connection to see if it was a glitch.  The solar panel started charging again but the stopped charging a few days later.  I purchased a Ring solar panel and will try that out to see if the cam is the problem.
5,Charges camera well
5,These are more affordable and work really well.  No issues with either since installation.
4,Working perfectly both my batteries are always fully charged no problem
5,First  I don’t do any reviews unless I Really like or dislike something....  To start off with we love our Ring Spotlight Cam!  We ended up with two which are mounted on each end of the house. A/C power was not easily accessible; so I opted for the rechargeable battery style - knowing that I would have to climb up a ladder to retrieve the batteries and recharge them every couple of weeks or so.  I didn’t mind doing it but have to admit that after a few months it got rather old.  Last Christmas my son gave us this solar panel power supply by Wasserstein.  This thing has far exceeded my expectations!!  At first I thought it was pretty cool and would just try it.  I chose to mount this on top of composite shingles.  Living in tornado alley  I wasn’t quite sure that the mounting bracket included in the kit would be strong enough by itself to withstand some of the extreme weather conditions we have.  Therefore secured a weatherproof flat plate junction box cover as a secure base and mounted the solar panel bracket on top of that.  It ain’t going nowhere....  I also added some silicone caulk around the plug where the cable attaches to the camera.  We have enjoyed this for 7 months now and this thing is AWESOME!!!  It keeps the battery fully charged!  (pics attached)  Since this device works so well  I bought another one for the other Spotlight Cam and mounted it on a galvanized pole where we have a security light.  Again chose to purchase some heavy duty brackets to mount securely to the light pole and this turned out to be another winner -  Totally eliminated the hassle and inconvenience of having to climb up a ladder each time the batteries needed to be recharged!!!  These have been in some pretty rough weather I might add and at one point I chose to dismount them from the mounting bracket prior to a hail storm which was easy enough to do.  All I can say is:  I am one happy customer!  I would highly recommend this product for circumstances like this.
4,Works so good I bought 3 of them.
5,I've recommended this to all my neighbors who use ring cams... This saves you from ever having to recharge those batteries!
5,These work fantastic. No more charging batteries in the ring cameras!
5,Works great
4,I bought the Wasserstein solar panel for the Ring Spotlight Cam Battery because I didn't want to be taking down the camera to charge batteries.  I also bought their gutter mount.  I mounted the panel on the gutter mount then ran the cord to the back of the Spotlight Cam mounted it and voila I was done.  My camera's battery was at about 80% before hooking up the camera and with a few hours was up to 100% - impressive for a panel that is only 2 watts. If you get 4-5 hours of semi-direct sunlight it should be enough to top off your battery each day.  If you don't see a difference right a way give it time.  The Ring camera seems notoriously slow in reporting battery health.  It may take a few hours to show in the app.  If you have a voltmeter test the panel to make sure it is putting out 5 volts just to make sure you don't have a problem before you install it.  I have a few more cameras to install so it is likely I will be buying more.  A nice-to-have would be some velcro hooks or something like that to secure the 13ft power cord so it doesn't flap in the wind or give rodents or squirrels the incentive to chew on it. Highly recommended!
5,Good quality material it conveniently comes with a long cord
4,Well I was a bit cautious  on how well this solar panel was going to work for my Ring Camera prior to this panel my battery would only last a week and a half or so before i would have to charge it again. So i got the panel in Jan 2021 and followed the instruction the install was pretty simple a couple of screws. I made sure that where i placed it would receive a decent amount of sun light then i plugged the Ring spotlight Camera to it and i have not touched my battery since! So like I said I was surprised on how well this works and I'm an old retired Military man so equipment working like it should is very important and this panel works. I placed mine on a stucco surface so i drilled some holes first and then inserted the plastic anchor sleeves first then the screws into the sleeves. If surface is wood you could go without the sleeves and simply use the screws. It is a pretty simple job to install this panel and wont take you that long 25-35 minutes.
5,This is my second solar panel - Ring cameras used to run out of charge in a few days. They both are mounted high in the house it was a pain to get them recharged. With these panels it is plug-and-forget.
5,Had trouble mounting it because it is on the North Side of the house but finally found a place.  Keeps the camera at 100% most of the time even when cloudy and cold.  Never get below about 90% and I have the camera doing snapshots as often as possible turning on whenever any camera on the network detects motion ect  Basically I'm using as much battery as possible.
5,This is a few bucks cheaper but great ! Easy to install as well. My ring app registers it as a ring panel so it’s working flawlessly you can use all the features on the app as if it was the ring brand save the money and this I don’t see why not !
5,This is a great value for the money. We have not had to replace the battery since we hooked it up to the solar panel.  I would purchase it again.
5,I bought this solar panel to go with my Ring stick up camera since the Ring Solar panel would be delayed by 10 days and I wanted to install both the camera and solar panel at the same time. It is a perfect match to the Ring brand solar panel at a $10 savings. The Wasserstein solar panel is identical in size shape and attaching hardware to the ring with the exception you don't get a screwdriver to do the install with like the Ring solar panel includes. For $10 dollars less I could do without the screwdriver and use my own. As far the functionality of this solar panel it works perfectly! the battery will run down a little {about 20 %} at night as I have my camera set to use all the functions like snapshots and constant motion checks. Within the first thirty minutes of sunlight the battery in the camera is up to 100% and it remains that way the rest of the day. Do yourself a favor and pick one of these up for your ring cameras or spotlight cameras and save yourself some  money that is unless you want to spend $10 more to get a screwdriver from Ring.
5,Battery life almost always at 99%. Including a photo of my front camera which gets more traffic than the others and battery life is awesome! I’m glad I gave this one a try! So worth it.
5,Bought 3 of these just about a year ago and 1 has already quit working. No output from it at all it ended up frying the battery in my Ring Camera too. 😕. So now I need a new solar panel charger and a new battery too…
4,This works just like my ring solar panel for a much better price!
5,We installed three of these panels in July 2020 one for each of our outdoor cams. Because we are on the Canadian border we get 18 hours of daylight in the summer and 6 in the winter. Our clouds and rain are legendary where nearby Forks home of the Twilight series gets 12 feet of annual rainfall.While July through October charging was great I was really curious how these panels would perform in the stormy and dark November to February season.The results are in and I am astounded. All through the winter my frequent checks of 'device health' showed the cam's charge level never dropped below 91%!These panels definitely do the the job.Use care when installing - find an unobstructed south facing view for each panel and attach the panel securely using the included hardware. I used  12" length of 1x4 to extend the panel away from the roofline in one location and that helped tremendously. Give yourself lots of time to get the panels up and use cable stays and wire ties to secure the power cable. Be careful on the ladder!
4,Bought 2 of them with 2 spotlight cams I purchased.  I already had a stickup cam installed for my driveway with a ring solar panel.  After installing one of my spotlights on the side of my house I liked the picture and angle of view so I replaced my stickup with the other spotlight cam.  I don’t want to change out solar panels so I used the ring on my new spotlight. I installed my stickup cam in my backyard and installed this solar panel but after installation found out the plug on this panel does not fit a stick up cam despite saying it does.  When you place the plug in it does not engage and is very loose and you can tell is not making a connection.  I had to change out my ring solar panel to my backyard.  I left the mounts in place.  This panel fit in the ring mount with no issues but the ring panel had a very tight fit on the mount that came with this panel.  I was able to get it to latch.  The panel charges well and it has kept my spotlight cam at 100% during the day.  The mount that comes with this is nicer than the ring mount as it allows 360 degrees of rotation.  The quality appears the same as the ring.  I gave 4 stars because it does not work with the stickup cam as advertised.
5,Never even have to look at my batteryamytime motion is detected it records for 90 seconds with snapshots every 14 minbattery always remains @ 100%great value for $
5,For outdoor stick up cam.
5,After several months of charging our ring batteries nearly every 2 weeks we finally decided to buy a solar panel. This works perfect with our camera and has kept our battery life at almost always 100%!
5,I just purchased my second Wasserstein solar panel my previous one was purchased 3 years ago still working fine . I just added another ring stick up cam.
5,I didn't want to deal with battery charging so it made sense to consider a solar set up to keep my Ring camera fully charged and working for me.  I chose the Wasserman Solar panel to get the higher amperage.  Extremely easy to set up and connect.  Take your time... you could do this in less than 15 minutes.But consider you location make sure you can get the sunlight  you need at the degree of inclination for both summer and winter.  Change your inclination at spring and fall.  My panel was white I mounted it on top of my roof rain gutter with sheet metal screws in a great location with a southern exposure.  Because white is so obvious to any passerby or neighbors I masked the panel facing and spray painted in a mottled color of burn orange black and tan to get the same appearance as my asphalt roofing tiles.  It blends in well and is nearly invisible.  Paint your wire to match your house and the unit disappears.. Perfect.  The camera is fully charged 100% of the time.  I'll try to remember to do a follow-up this December.  Winter in the NW at 47 degrees Latitude can be pretty dark rainy and cold.Right now I am considering ways to use another Wasserman on my sailboat to keep small electronic charged.  In the case the attraction is size.  Yep I would buy again... you will too!
5,Just what my camera needed
5,I’ve had this item for 7 months now and has been a tremendous help. Works great!
5,Just got to charge ring camera that was draining wat too fast! Within first day it brought it up from 60% to 100% —and it has stayed there for over a week. Easy to set up. Will e thrilled if it continues working as well.
5,We have a battery spotlight cam high up in front of our place. I bought extra batteries and would exchange out when they got low but got tired of climbing a ladder every few months to change them out. Bought this solar panel plugged it in and now the batteries stay fully charged. Easy installation and compatible with Ring cameras. *Tip: when the solar panel is not being charged in the sunlight the Ring app will show that it’s disconnected.
5,So I read several reviews on how the product does not work with Ring. I plugged it into my Ring very easily and it keeps my device fully charged all the time.
5,Works as advertised.
5,Outstanding value.
5,Perfect! Put up with ease! Even though it’s a knock off from Ring’s product we are very satisfied.
5,It works great! No more taking out batteries to recharge! Already have two and it's been fantastic!
4,It doesn't fit. I pushed hard to but didn't want to damage. It clearly doesn't fit the port on the Spotlight camera like it claims on the product description. Don't do it !REVISED REVIEW: This actually fits my Ring Spotlight Cam and seems to functioning as described. It's not obvious but there's a slider that comes off the Camera that makes the port more accessible and you have pop out a rubber gasket. Then it fits snuggly and so far seems to be charging and the battery icon has a sun next to it indicating Solar is plugged in properly.
5,Used for my ring camera so I wouldn’t have to replace batteries so far so good
5,I wasn't sure if I should buy this solar panel with the funny name but boy was I wrong! It has worked out perfectly for me. The light above my driveway needed to have the battery replaced every other week... With two batteries even! I decided to go ahead and purchase the solar panel because of the price and the reviews but I really wasn't sure. Believe me it was the right thing to do! When I installed it one battery was completely dead and the other was at 30%. Within 4 days both batteries were at 100% and I've never had below 70% on one battery and a hundred percent on the other since then! The ring camera on there goes off a lot because I live on a busy Street so that solar panel gets a big workout and comes out shining like a rose! I just purchased a second one so that I could put a ring doorbell at my back door where there's no wiring. Don't worry about the name! You can trust this thing to do what they say!UPDATE:  6 months later and I have never had one of my batteries in my Ring camera/light below 80% with the other 100%!!!  I was a bit worried that this bargain would come at a price but I was wrong!  It's still working GREAT!
5,Had this for over a year keeping battery life full. Great product and worth every penny. Keep this product reliable
5,The solar panel was easy to mount and eliminates the need for recharging the battery for my Ring Stick Up camera.
4,Arrived timely and well packaged.  However not sure if this will do the job.  It is connected to my battery operated Ring camera.  I am not confident the power plug is fully attached to the camera.  The provided attachment screws are not long enough to secure the cord to the camera no big deal just needed to provide my own.  I fully charged the battery and will see how long it will hold a charge with the solar panel attached.  The camera works great covers a wide area with good detail.  I will provide an update after a few weeks.  If it works as advertised I plan to keep if not back it goes and I will just buy additional battery packs.Okay the charger seems to be working.  Overall after 5 days and nights I am pleased with this combo.  I am updating my rating to from a 3 to a 4.  IF the package contained the proper screws I would give it a 5.  However seems like a solid option if you are in the market for a security camera and charging option.
5,I bought a two pack of Ring Spotlight Cam Battery and was seriously concerned about the battery life. Before I got around to mounting them I bought these solar panels as I didn’t want to do the work twice.So far I’ve had these up for a couple of days and I’m seriously impressed. One faces the east side of our home on the corner lot with no obstructions and the other is on the west side however we do have another house on the west side of us.Both cameras so far have stayed at 100%. The panel on the west camera gets a limited amount of sun but so far I am impressed.Installation is easy - two screws to mount to the wall and two screws to secure the power connector to the camera. The cord included looks to be at least 12 feet so you can mount this where the panel will get optimal sun and the camera can be in a shady area.I don’t know how these compare to the Ring branded panels as I don’t have one but price wise these are about $15 cheaper and seem to work great. I will be buying more of these as I acquire more cameras.
5,The solar panel stopped working over two months ago — less than a year after purchasing. I’m incredibly disappointed with this purchase.
5,Works great and keeps my stick up Cam charged.
5,This solar panel works exactly as advertised and is a snap to put up.  I no longer have to worry about climbing a ladder to take out the battery from my outdoor ring cam to recharge it.  The power cable is long enough to give me location flexibility as well.
5,Bought this to go with a Ring outdoor security camera with floodlight.  This was very easy to install. There is a significant amount of cable to run from the solar panel to the camera. This works extremely well. I have two battery packs in the camera. I check them every couple of weeks. I have never found a back up battery to be less than 100% and the primary battery to be less than 97%. Extremely pleased with this product. The size is not overwhelming and yet it is big enough to maintain a full charge on my security camera
5,So far i have noot hadany problems charged the battery to full charge  two thoughts i had the gutter bracket could be just a little to give more adjustment to receive direct sunlight and the other is if you could include the dize of the drill bit if you are using the mounting bracket  if you are not a pro it is trial and error so you dont drill the hole oversize then the anchors are useless
5,Plugged right in and matched the camera very well.
5,For the ring camera
1,I ordered this on April 22nd and by October 5th it was no longer charging my camera at all.  I've been keeping the surface clean and it is in bright wreck sunlight atop my roof all morning and afternoon until later in the day. It worked great for about 3 months. Then it said the battery on my camera needed to be charged. But it should have been charged by this. I cleaned it and made sure it was still facing the sun. And it worked again for a while but now my battery is dying every few days because it is doing all the work with no help from this solar panel. Don't buy it. Look for a different mode. My neighbor has begun having trouble with hers as well in about the same timeframe.
5,This is excellient
5,Perfect fit for for my Ring stick up cameras. I bought three. The installation was very easy my only complaint is that there isn’t a great way to manage the extra wire that you may not need I wrapped it around the mounting bracket I did my best but it looks a little sloppy.  If someone wants to snoop behind my solar panel and sees the wire wrapped around there I guess that’s their problem. I’d recommend - better price than the OEM and the camera doesn’t know the difference.  I charged my battery from 82% to 100% in about 4 hours of good sunlight (in 32 degree winter day with direct sunlight) this should keep me off ladders swapping out batteries every few weeks! 😀
5,Nice addition to my ring cameras.  They do a a great job keeping my camera batteries charged with out the need to remove them to charge them up the old way.  I have multiple cameras on my house so I bought one of these to try out.  It cost a bit less than the Ring brand solar panels but works so well that I bought a second one to use on the far side of my house where I don’t have any other way to change the battery without removing it. Well worth the investment.
5,What can I really say? The installation was simple the panel looks fine and it works just like I was expecting it would. It powers my Ring spotlight battery camera well enough I'm not remotely concerned about the battery running out of power. It's a set it and forget it kind of product that makes life a little easier. It also adds to the bulk of the installation which enhances the security theater a little bit.Edit: So I imagine many other users encountered the exact same problem I have this winter. If the battery's temperature drops below freezing it will cease to accept a charge from the solar panel. This sucks but it's for the best. Apparently charging lithium at temperatures below freezing has an incredibly adverse impact on the life of the battery.  So it's a safety feature but it makes the solar panel a bit pointless if you live in either a place that's regularly below freezing temperatures or if you have sufficiently cold and long winters. The end result is I'll probably wind up having to charge the battery once before our winter is through. A minor hassle for a good reason.
5,I have several and I am very happy with them.
5,I had read some reviews that the app didn't recognize the solar panel. mine did! I just got these indoor outdoor stick up cams this year and I was tired of switching batteries. this solar panel charged from 0% after a week to 60% in a day. love it so far. we will see with time.
5,The original ring panel wasn't charging very well anymore.... Slow. I cleaned off the face but it didn't make a difference. I use it year round in temps that range from-10 below to 90 I guess the degradation was inevitable.This one worked great and had my batteries topped off to 100% daily even in cloudy conditions with only a few hours of light. Everything needed to connect was in the box anchors and screws arm and the tiny screws and washers to connect to the back of the camera. Only thing it didn't come with was the screw driver from there original ring but I have several of those already.  Very happy so far will update as time goes on to see if the charging ability holds up.ETA I've had some time to compare this panel to the others under the same circumstance  weather use etc. This panel keeps my battery at 100% while the others that are a year old keep the battery at 87% after the same light time. I will be replacing the year old panels with these. I assume the degradation is just from time and weather. Good to know.
5,I bought Wasserstein solar panel for my Ring video camera but was initially worried it wouldn't charge the batteries as good as the name brand Ring solar panel but was pleasantly surprised. It works perfectly and charges the batteries consistently to 100%. And it was less money than the Ring brand! Thanks Wasserstein for being a more affordable alternative!
4,I received this product for my ring camera that is battery operated.It is compatible with the camera however it does take time for the battery To charge on a sunny day.Sometimes it’s a hit or miss when it charges because there are times where my ring camera is down to 30% on a full day. I am unsure if it is a loose connection because there are other times where it does charge the battery. I did have to purchase a separate gutter holder for the solar panel to install to the house. Otherwise it does come in two colors white or black  to blend into the house.I wish it did come with multiple all the colors however I am happy with what I purchased.Thanks
5,Don't like to pay for brand names? this product is exactly like the original one do the some job and it looks cleam
5,It really charges. And it is of good quality.
4,This does work with Ring stick-up cameras but oddly the screws supplied are too short so I had to duct-tape the plug to the Ring camera.  Unsightly but the back is hidden from view anyway.My main problem is that the camera is mounted in the middle of a large shaded area and the panel is beside it  pointing skywards.  It does not get direct sunlight and without direct sunlight it does not generate power so don't get this if you can't mount the solar panel in direct sunlight.  There are $10 extension cables that are 2.5m long but that's not long enough for my purposes so this panel is no use to me.That said I knew it was a risk and it was pretty cheap so no great harm done.
5,Product arrived early and works great with my Ring Spotlight cam. Was hesitant with it not being the Ring panel but definitely made the right choice. Saved a ton of money! 10/10 recommend.
5,Only had it a few days now but it definitely charges more then the camera uses in a day. The side of the house I have the cam on only gets sunlight for about 6 hours a day. When I hooked it up the battery was at 38%. 3 days later it's now at 95%. The camera faces the front of my house so it sees alot of movement and records alot. I am happy with this purchase and will be buying more for the rest of my cameras.
5,Bought this because it was cheaper than the Ring version by quite a bit.  My cam battery was at 73% when I installed the solar panel.  Within a couple of hours the cam battery was up a couple of points so I knew it was at least working.  The next day the cam battery charge was in the mid 90's.  Its been about a week and I just checked the battery charge.  Its at 99% at 9:45 AM.  So the cam ran all night and is still quite full of charge.  Also please note that my solar panel is not in an optimal spot.  I get sunlight onto the panel but it is mounted under the eve of my roof.  So I only get direct sunlight on the solar panel for a few hours a day as the sun passes over my house.  I think it would get much more sun if I posted it up on a fence or somewhere with unrestricted sunlight.  But this thing definitely works!
5,Hooked this up mid-day on a Saturday and the battery was at 48%.  By dusk the battery was at 69%.  Does what it says it will do and an easy install. Will update if any issues present but so far so good.update Jan 03 2020:  During periods of extended cloudy weather and low angle of the sun I did need to remove the battery and charge manually on one occasion.  However as the weather cleared and the panel is getting more direct sunlight there have been no issues.  I continue to recommend this product.further update 04/29/2021:  continues to function beautifully.  i have relocated the panel with improved function.  single battery in my ring camera and have never had the battery get below 80% during winter when the sun is lower on the horizon.  battery usually remains over 95% charge.  continue to recommend.
5,This panel works just as good as the Ring panel that comes with the kit. I have two Ring cameras around my house. One has the Ring panel the other has the Wasserstein Panel. For $10 less this panel work just as well as the Ring panel. The mounting hardware is of good material along with the panel its self. All my Ring cameras stay 100% charged with these panels even on semi-cloudy days. I have no trees around my house so get that in mind when using these panels. All in all I am very happy with this panel it does what they say for less cost. You basically pay $10 to have "Ring" printed on a Ring panel. Save your money go with the Wasserstein.
5,We received a ring spotlight cam as a gift. It came with the usual single battery. I put the camera up with field of view in mind not climbing the ladder every other week to grab the battery charge it climb the ladder and re insert it in the camera.  So instead of going for the $10 more expensive ring brand solar panel the frugal guy in me chose the Wasserstein Solar Panel. The panel has been installed for a couple weeks and has kept the single battery charged hovering between 90 and one hundred percent through normal spring weather here in Maine.
5,Have these on my ring cameras. There always charged to 100%
1,Bought this to use with my Ring floodlight camera above my garage. After exactly 1 year and 5 months IT COMPLETELY STOPPED WORKING. We tried everything to troubleshoot (clean thoroughly uninstall/install charge the battery to the Ring camera check wiring etc) but could not get it to work and power my security camera. I contacted the seller and they were useless. Told me to try the things I had already tried to get it working again. Then they advised THEY ONLY HAVE A THREE MONTH RETURN POLICY. Ok thanks for nothing. Shouldn’t have gone with the knock off.
5,We have purchased two ring cameras with floodlights.  The batteries on them don't last very long at all.  We purchased this solar panel for the first one and it works great.  It took about 24 hours to charge the battery completely.  Since then the battery stays close to 100% always (this is in South Carolina - so your sun may vary).  We got the second Wasserstein for a second camera and it too works well.
5,Great value works with ring stick up camera. My neighbors dog scaled my stuff foot privacy fence entered my home through my senior dog's dog door and killed my cat in my bedroom while I was at work. I was a mess and constantly afraid it would happen again. Ring panel was back ordered so I got this my friend installed it immediately. Now I have eyes on my fence at all times and peace of mind.
5,Added it to front porch camera and haven't had remove battery in over 2 and half year. Great addition to the Ring  camera.
4,***Update review***After my initial review contact was made with the manufacturer. I advised them of the issues I was having with the product not working. It took a little bit of work but they were able to resolve my issue and it is now working properly as it is supposed to. The customer service was excellent.Worked for a week. The first week i tried it worked good was able to charge the battery little by little over the course of a few days so that at least I didn't lose battery life. I had to relocate the camera so i took it down charged it to 100% and set it back up. I expected the same results only better since the battery started at 100%. I had not been checking the battery status because I knew that it was charging. When I looked a few days later I had lost battery and it was clear this wasn't not charging at all. This product doesn't work save your money buy the real solar charger.
4,Charged my ring battery cam from 80 to 100% on the first day. Registers correctly with ring phone app. can't speak for longevity but initially i'm very pleased indeed.
5,I got this over the Ring version mostly to cut down on getting excess junk. (I have quite the collection of Ring screwdrivers at this point). I didn't think I would need the extra rotational degree of freedom but I ended up in a tricky corner for installation and appreciated the extra flexibility to get the angle just so. In the peak of winter I only get two hours of direct sunlight so optimizing the angle probably helps. As is I am slowly charging a half-empty Ring Spotlight Cam battery with the two hours of sunlight a day.While the instructions mention the importance of using the supplied screws for water tightness of the cable connection they don't specify that you need to insert the supplied O-rings around the screws and plug. It's obvious if you look at them (they're in the same bag and sized appropriately) but it's just not explicit. I suspect the Ring version comes with the O-rings pre-installed and the instructions were modeled after that.Can't really comment on durability yet but the construction looks solid.
5,We purchased 2 of the solar panels for our outdoor cameras. After one month our review is that they are worth the price. Our part of Texas has a year-round sun. But we did have a cloudy day once this year and the panel still produced enough energy to manage the cameras fine. The solar panels have kept our cameras rolling just right. We try to use solar when possible; we were happy to pay the extra price and skip having to climb on the house to replace batteries. They look nicely along the top of our home without attracting too much attention. If you found this information useful click the helpful button below so Amazon will know it's an excellent product to keep.
4,Since there wasn't suitable wall location for the camera height/direction wise I made an arm with 2x4 to put the camera and this solar panel up. If I made the cable very short it looked better but I didn't want to bother splicing soldering and shrink-tubed the whole cable was wrapped in the plastic bag and cable-tied it around the 2x4. In the last 2 weeks since I installed the battery goes down as low as 60% every night. Yet being charged up to 100% around noon while it's sunny. I believe it'll be charged up to 100% a way before dusk even the whether is cloudy or rainy.Revised: Probably the camera's battery wasn't initially charged enough at the time it's installed now the health statement of the camera shows 100% or near 100% in every morning even after previous day was rainy. So both units are currently working ideally but we will see after 5 to 10 years later.
5,I've been running it for 8 months now. Battery typically shows being at 98% - 100%. The CAM typically records ~30 events/day. There are usually 3-6 recorded at night with the spotlight on due to critters in the back yard. Battery stays fully charged in winter and summer. I am located in the California bay area (10 mins north of San Jose) so we get a lot of sun during the day.Heads-up that during the first 24 hours it didn't appear to be charging the battery.  I had checked the output voltage of the panel when I installed it  so I contacted RING support as I knew the panel was producing power. Ring Support told me that a firmware update was required and was already scheduled to happen for my CAM. Sure enough after the update the battery charged rapidly and has remained at 98% - 100% ever since.
5,Easy to install a must for wireless cameras who wants to recharge batteries
5,We no longer need to keep track of our battery life since getting this. It attached to our gutter (with additional attachment piece) and now our batteries are charged to 97-100% at all times. No more getting up on a ladder to change out and  charge run down batteries. Good investment!
5,This solar panel does exactly what it is supposed to. It plugs directly in to the new models of ring cameras and charges the battery. The plug on this is round and fits the new models so if you have an older model camera you may need to seek an older model panel or an adapter. I had just gotten these ring spotlight outdoor cameras and the battery life was not great given the amount of activity it was recording. These panels started charging as soon as I plugged it in and have kept my cameras charged. No issues at all and I would definitely recommend these panels.
5,Got these panels since they were described as being compatible w Ring Spotlight Cams. Ring panels were out of stock & needed a system to monitor contractors…quickly. The Ring app doesn’t report anything except that they are connected & apparently charging dual battery cameras. So far so good-after 3 days in service. I did not measure the output voltage while in direct sun but may check that & report back any anomalies.
5,I thought: OK solar and battery power are really really horrible. So I was hoping this panel would increase the time between pulling the batteries and charging them by maybe 50%-100%. I took both batteries out and put them on  a charger while I installed the panel. Both batteries were dead when I removed them. Once everything was installed I put both batteries back in. One battery was below 10% and the other was in the low teens. I thought for sure the camera would die in a couple days. Nope! By about day 3 both batteries were at 100% and they've never been below about 98%. I live in the Cleveland area so lots of cloudy days and this product has been great. I have a Ring Spotlight cam with 2 batteries plugged into it.
5,It took almost a week for the batteries to get fully charged because it was an overcast week. However once both batteries got fully charged they have been totally full since then.The installation can be as hard or as easy as you want it to be. If you put a little planning into your installation it will make your actual installation more likely to be easy and successful. The best part is it is significantly cheaper than the "A" one.Buy with confidence. There are always people that aren't mechanically inclined and get easily frustrated when they have a screwdriver in their hands unfortunately they do like to leave reviews just ignore them. This solar charger is very well built and operates exactly as described.
5,Purchased two for Ring battery powered cameras have used for around three weeks they're keeping my camera batteries at 100%.
3,It works until the temperature drops down in the teens and below zero. Both batteries died and the camera was offline.
5,This is my second solar charger for Ring cameras. I bought the first one in 2020 and it still works great. Easy to install on eave of house and I don't have to get on ladder to recharge batteries in cameras any longer.
5,I didn’t think this product was going to work...especially the way they say. As previous reviews state you can’t tell when it’s actually working you have to come and check the app every so often to see. We installed the solar panel on a very overcast Florida afternoon. To my surprise within a couple hours it charged it 5%+. I couldn’t believe it and thought maybe the battery sensor was wrong. So far we’ve had it for about a week and it’s been great. We can have the sensor set to maximum notifications set to maximum and day after day we’ve had the alarm battery pretty consistently at 100%.The funniest part is that when we got the box it was delivered damaged in our driveway with one corner pretty badly caved it...figured it 100% wasn’t going to work. Really surprised me. Ordered a second one and hoping to get lucky again with a good one (because it seems like some people are getting bad ones).
5,I have two Ring battery Floodlight Cams. I bought the Ring solar panel for the first installation and was pleased with the performance.  It keeps the battery at 95 to 100% consistently depending on the clouds.  On my second Floodlight Cam the Wasserstein solar panel performs exactly as good as the Ring panel and was significantly less expensive.  Both panels get about 2-3 hours of daily direct sunlight. If there's a few cloudy days the battery will dip to 85-90% but the first sunny day will restore the battery to 95-100%. It may take another day for a full charge.  So far I'm very pleased with the results.  The quality is as good as the Ring product.
5,THIS specific product is terrific to extend battery life unless it is January in South East MI. The other items is where help is needed education shared (cameras  batteries range extenders  Chime Pro). Remember this is a solar item. Useful when it's location is sunny. The panel rests on an easy to move piece making it simple to aim in the most sun- filled location.
5,Works great with the Ring outdoor battery cam. It basically plugs in there isn’t a place to attach and secure the cord to the camera other than plugging it into the back of the new released Ring outdoor cameras which sell for about $99. With the older version Ring outdoor cameras you could screw the solar panel wire onto the back of the camera. This one just plugs in but is secure enough when the panel is installed and the wire doesn’t move about.  I haven’t had any problems with it even in the heavy rainy season. Great value for about $35 and it beats taking out the battery and charging it every couple of months. I would certainly recommend.
5,Good value for money very effective
5,Works perfectly with my ring spotlight cam. Keeps the camera charged and topped up. I have this in a location that gets a few hours of sun everyday. It took a day or two for the battery to be fully changed and once charged the battery hasn't discharged to low levels. I have the samera in a relatively low traffic area so it is at most 2-3 alerts a day.
5,Easy to hook up. Works fine with the ring stick came. Lightweight.
5,This is the third Wasserstein solar panel I’ve bought. I needed this one for another spotlight cam we added. They work in extreme heat and very cold snowy weather. The solar panel is built very well and stands up to harsh conditions. This is the best way to keep the batteries charged especially when the cams are mounted high and hard to get to the batteries. I highly recommend this solar panel to use with battery operated ring cameras.
5,I didn’t think it was going to work but then read comments and questions and saw where you have to remove a small part on the camera for it to fit!Been working great for sometime now!!  Need to get another one!
2,I was extremely disappointed with this solar charger. I do have a Ring branded solar charger on one camera that actually is on the north side of our house and it is set up to point east to catch the morning sun and it works very well.I thought it would be a no-brainer to save a little money and try this knock-off at a lower price and place it on the south side of our home and point it to the south. Well it did not charge the camera to more than 50% and after a dull day or two the camera stopped working.I sent this one back and ordered a Ring branded charger and it's working fine.Maybe I received a bad unit who knows?
5,They were easy to install and seem to be working great! My batteries stay pretty much fully charged all day long. Well see how it goes but so far I’m really glad I bought these. Saves me busting out the ladder every two-three weeks and not having a camera for a night while the batteries charge
5,So I installed this myself this past Friday evening  my battery was in the low 80% when when i finished the install got up the next morning and began doing some work around my home when i decided ton heck the battery life and i was somewhat stunned because within just a few hours it was at 99%. So I skipped saturday & Sunday I went to an event & I hot a few text fron my camera of activity and by nightfall it was again in the 83% range due to heavy reporting of motion yet I checked roughly no longer than say an hour ago and even at this very moment I'm at 99%! This solar panel is exactly what I needed and performs just as described. Would highly recommend!!!
4,I used this product to charge my Ring camera. It takes longer for the Ring battery to drain but it does still happen. I was under the impression that the battery would remain charged. Also the colder it gets even if sunny outside seems to have an effect on the ability of the Solar panel to charge the battery. It seems as if the charging stops and the Ring battery drains. When this happens it is annoying to have to take the battery out of the camera and plug it in for a full charge.
4,Nothing so far
4,I was skeptical at first. When I had installed this late in the evening my battery was at 56 so I was anxious to see how much my battery would juice up. The next morning nothing changed. I checked later in the afternoon still no change. I assumed it did not work as there isn’t an icon like a lightning bolt that indicates that it is working. When I got home to checking my wiring I checked my battery level once more it was now at 80. Yes progress it is working. The next day was quite overcast and the battery only got up to 90. Finally by day 3 it is at 100 and has stayed there.
5,This solar panel works great and was easy to install.  I was using two batteries in my device and having to recharge one of the batteries at least every couple weeks or more.  Since I installed the panel both batteries have it all times been at full charge. I finally decided to pull out one of the batteries since there’s no sense in charging two batteries if one is going to always be fully charged. Now I have a spare battery in case the other one goes bad.  Very happy.
4,It's an exact fit for the Ring Outdoor Battery Cam. Nuff said.
5,It's what I was looking for!
5,Replaced a Wasserstein solar panel that went bad after 2 years. Purchased as a warehouse deal for 35 bucks.  Arrived almost new condition.  Ideal replacement.  Only difference was the plug.  Old plug screwed into the ring spotlight camera this plug doesn’t have that option.  Still works fine.
5,This is the absolute best way to go to keep your batteries charged.  We bought a camera that needed a battery.  Well it holds 2.  So it didn't take long for me to figure out that instead of constantly going to replace the used battery with the second one I had purchased this little gem was a great fix.  Put it on the roof plugged it in and I haven't had to change a battery since.  Love it!!!
5,I am so excited for these solar panels I don’t have to worry about battery life going down.  Thank you so much
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               El producto lo uso para cargar mi cámara ringY es bastante eficiente ese cargador solar para cargar la batería al 100% y no tener que recargarla en electricidad nunca más
5,Great price.  Works perfectly charging my dying Ring camera (as the 15-month-old original Ring solar panel was no longer charging it).  It is completely compatible with the original Ring solar panel.  I loved how it even perfectly fit the original bracket so I didn't have to reinstall the bracket.  I just slid the old original non-functional panel off the bracket and slid this one on.  Camera battery went from 6% to 100% in about 5 days on partly sunny days with about 2-4hrs of daily direct sunlight.  Maintaining 100% now after 5 weeks.
5,Other than its made in CHINa seems to be holding up so far. It will rain tomorrow so I'll find out if it's rain resistant. So far its doing what it was designed to do. More manufacturing needs to be done in the USA.... Americans need jobs stop farming work out to CHINA and other 3rd would countries. Yes chinA is a 3rd world country!!
4,I connected this panel to feed my outdoor Ring stick up cam and the installation was very easy the only issue with this panel and that is why I don’t give a five star is because it doesn’t charge the battery at all in cloudy days and in sunny days it doesn’t charge it fast it can take the hole day charging for only raise up the charge between 20% to 30% more of what it was however stills charge it and you don’t have to be taking the Battery down often
5,It took less than 30 minutes to install and connect to our Ring Stick Up cam.  One thing you should know is to make sure you fully charge your battery before you install the solar system.  It is designed to trickle charge and it will keep your battery fully charged provided there is sufficient sunlight.  We're very happy with the product.
5,I used this for my Ring Camera with spotlight.  It plugged in the back just as decribed and charges the battery (I only have 1 battery installed).  At 1 point my battery was in the 60% range and it charged it back to full.  I love not having to take the ladder out to climb up and charge a battery any longer
4,It's a nice sturdy solar panel. It was a pain to put up as we had to buy additional screws and anchors since what was provided didnt work on our house and we had to buy the wire hangers to affix the cable to the home but I knew it didnt come with the wire hangers. As far as charging goes it's slow to charge. Took 3 days to go up 10% on full sun days. That being said we pulled out the battery charged it and put it back in. The solar pannel it will work nicely for keeping the battery on the ring charged from that perspective. We shouldn't need to pull the battery put again.
4,Great product the only reason we didn’t give five star reviews was we wish it would have come with wire clips to clip the wires from the panel to the camera.
5,Bought a pair of panels for two ring wireless cameras on the house.  One worked perfectly but the other was a dud.  The seller and amazon worked with me and got a replacement out right away.  Easy to install ran the cable under the shingles and had plenty of cord for the install.Did take one day for the charge to start but now my cameras are never under 95% battery strength.  So definitely worth the investment vs. installing two batteries and having to pull them for a recharge in a few months.  This way my ladder stays in the garage.oh yeah - make sure you install the plastic washers they help keep water out and reduce rust.
5,Works just as expected and price was good.
5,The one I just purchased is a gift so I haven’t opened it. However I have several of these panels on other cameras around our home. I am very happy with the performance of all of them. I live in the Pacific Northwest with several cloudy days but these panels keep the batteries charged above 90% at all times. I highly recommend these panels to all our family and friends.
5,Wasn't sure if I was going to keep.  The panel would always to be in the shaded part of the yard. 1st plugged in the battery was 27%. Stick Up Cam.. Sky's always cloudy & at times pretty dark & snowing.  No direct sun. 2 - 3 weeks now battery @71%. It's a keeper 4 me!
5,The Solar Panel was easy to install and a breeze to hookup to the camera. We now have put the ladder away and no longer have to use it to retrieve the battery for a recharge. Much easier and much safer.
5,Stopped working at about 13 months in.
5,Easy to hook up to our Ring Spot Light Camera. This solar panel and the Spotlight camera use the round plug instead of the micro USB plug the older Ring cameras used. The panel has a long cord which helped with the install. It seems to work best in full bright sunlight. At first we had it under the eve of the house but it still received light. The battery was at 33% before we installed the panel. It fluctuated a little up and down but stayed in that range for a couple days. So my husband moved it out where the sun is beating down on it. Two sunny days later it is up to 56%. So eventually it will get up to 100% and be fine. I just ordered another Ring spotlight camera and the same model solar panel. Works fine and hopefully last a long time.
5,Easy to mount and plug in
5,Works good so far.  Was leary at first because when I installed it was cloudy alllll the time so would barely charge.  Multiple consecutive sunny days had charged my spotlight cam about 14%.  Now months later the battery never dips before 98%.  I have ring spot light camera. No issues connecting it. Great value.
5,El panel solar funciona muy bien he tenido el problema de que en la mañana a veces aparece desconectada muevo el conector y de nuevo funciona bien.Carga la batería en un par de días desde cero.Tiene un muy buen acabado un cable largo que deja instalar el panel donde realmente reciba sol durante mas tiempo.Estoy muy contento con el panel.
1,I choose the product because of the price since it was cheaper than the original one. After five months it stops working. The app says it's connected but is not charging the battery. Lesson learned just buy the original product to receive full Ring support.
5,This purchase was delivered without any delay at all. The solar panels were super quick and easy to install and is now working perfectly keeping my 2 Ring Stick Up Cameras batteries charged.
5,Product works perfectly and is as described. Fast delivery
5,So far so good only time will tell if it holds up.  It has kept my Ring Stick up at 100 % charged.  Fingers crossed
5,It works as well as my ring solar panelsbut at a better pricewish I've seen them 1st.
5,I think I got a great deal on this solar panel as it looks and replicates the Ring version perfectly  but I got it for $15 less! I just installed it yesterday and it has brought my battery power from a continuously draining 52% up to 87% by the following morning. I’m very pleased that as long as the sun shines I’ll probably never have to manually charge my Ring surveillance camera’s batteries ever again. At the rate my batteries were previously draining I’d be recharging them at least once a month and in the dead of winter that would be a real problem! So glad I bought this Wasserstein solar charger!!!
5,I bought this solar panel because of the very thought of climbing up on a ladder frequently to charge the Ring's battery was nonsense. This automatically keeps it charged every day. Some of the reviewer's stated it was not charging their Ring cam/spotlight ? That is probably due to them not 1st testing the panels voltage output with a volt meter then making sure the plugin is all the way into the unit. My Ring app always shows a full battery charge everyday so do a complete install and you'll be happy with this panel.
5,I purchased my Spotlight Battery Cam with a single battery. I soon realized I needed a second battery or the Ring solar panel since I did not want to climb a ladder to charge batteries even occasionally. I found this panel cheaper price and decided to give it a try. I started with a low battery under 20% when I installed the panel. To my surprise after a couple of days in my case the battery charged to ver 100%. Since installation I have not seen the battery level go below 97% with normal usage.
5,I saw some of the negative reviews which made me a little skeptical about this solar panel. After ordering and receiving the panel I was able to install it very easily and get it connected to my Ring Spotlight Cam. At first I wasn't sure how effective it would be but that was about a month ago and my camera battery has been at 100% since I installed it (give or take 2% if it gets cloudy for a day or two). Overall I'm very happy I don't have to worry about taking out the battery to charge every week! Since installation it has rained several times and I'm still getting a good charge from it! Great product!!
5,For everyone that is saying it doesn't work with the new Stick Up Cam...it does! You need to remove the rubber spacers from the camera and it will fit perfectly.Had mine for only a day and the charge went from 33% in the morning to 74% in the evening. I am in sunny southern California and the temperature was around 80 degrees with no clouds maybe it could be angled a bit better to get a better view of the sun but with today's gain I will probably leave it the way it is.Totally satisfied with my purchase after the first day it looks very promising.Update: Day 2 and the charge is now up to 100%.
5,I have been recommending Wasserstein solar panels for Ring products for 2 years to my clients and I use them myself. This charged my ring Stickup cam from 20% to 100% in just 2 days of sunshine. No more climbing the ladder to take the battery in for a charge every month or two. Highly recommend this unit over all others.
5,Love this product. I was sick of charging my battery to my ring camera so this came in handy! No more taking out the battery to charge it! Yes!
5,I have previously have purchased all my Ring products from Ring.  I decided to take a chance and buy my next solar panel from Wasserstein in order to save a few bucks!  I am happy to report that this is identical to the Ring product in size features installation charging and packaging.  The only difference was the logo says Wasserstein vs. Ring.  It installed the same as Ring and functions the same and was made in China (same as Ring).  I saved $20 on the purchase.  I would buy this unit again for sure.
5,Nice arrangement and quite effective. Beats Rings price and interfaces perfectly with my Ring camera.You need to stare at it and match up the picture but once you do it all fits with no need for tools.
5,This is exactly what I needed to save me from climbing up a ladder every 3 months to recharge the batteries on my camera. The item arrived sooner than expected being I was out of town but no problem neighbor picked it up for me. I only had it up 2 days so I may reevaluate at a later time. Thanks a bunch
5,Even just half a day of sunlight and this easy to install solar panel works great in keeping the Ring camera battery fully charged.
5,So easy to install and works great.  Love that we never have to worry about charging the batteries to the camera.  We installed our camera in the back yard and there is no outlet near so this was an amazing option that works great.
5,I just finished installing this panel and connecting to my ring stick up camera. At first I thought it wasn’t going to fit since the plug wouldn’t go in so I looked on the amazon reviews to see if anyone else had that problem and found several saying it didn’t fit. Then I realized that the rubber spacers in the camera had to come out.  They were quickly taken out and the panel plugged in (see pictures). This step isn’t shown in the directions.  Within seconds the charge went from 97% to 100%. It’s still early but so far I am completely satisfied with the product.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 value for THE money.oh my goodness.MONEY TREES 🌳 🌲thanks 🙏🏼 so much  hooray 😃 today is the best day thanks toyou.cheers
5,I was worried at first that it wasn’t going to work. It took a day to go from 15-16%. But over time it kept going up and never down. Now 20 days later both back up batteries have stayed at and maintained 100% charge! To not have to climb up and take down the camera to charge is awesome! This one works great on the ring camera!
5,This device isn’t compatible with my Ring Doorbell my fault as I didn’t check out the specifics close enough. Then I didn’t even try it until well after the return window. Oh well live and learn!
5,Lo que más me gusta es que ya no tengo que estar subiendo y bajando la escalera para cargar la batería. El primer día que puse a funcionar el panel solar la batería de la cámara tenía una carga de 25% a los pocos días ya la carga no baja de 75%.
4,Update. I charged the battery and put it in a different slot and now it shows 100% charge after 3 days of use so it seems that the solar panel working. I am still not happy with hold time on customer service never heard anyone.  so I will up it to 4 stars.I bought the solar panel because my ring security camera's battery ran low after ONE WEEK. Installation was easy but it does not seem to charge the battery. I plugged it in when the battery was about 7% and not only it didn't maintain the charge level but the battery completely died.
5,Our ring battery used to have to be replaced every other day - we are now going about a week or more with this amazing solar product! We live on a busy corner and never have to worry about missing something now!
4,Easy to install works great for keeping my spotlight fam charging sonic dont have to climb a platter every 5-6 weeks
5,Keeps my Ring camera charged  all the time.
5,Bought this to add to my battery Ring security camera and we haven’t had to get up on the ladder to take batteries out to change them and back up to reinstall the batteries...this solar panel keeps our camera charged and working good!  Great value!
5,Works as advertised.  Keeps ring charged 100%.
5,The item is well made and easy to install.  It works better than I expected.  My battery level in my Ring Spotlight Cam was @74% when I connected the solar panel.  After connecting the solar panel it fully charged the battery of the Spotlight Cam to 100% in one day.
4,Used it to charge my Ring Battery Cam.  The sky has to be clear and sunny for it to really charge.  Otherwise it just trickles.  It took about 2 days to get the battery from 65% to 99%.  I would recommend this.
5,I had a handyman install this on top of the roof in full sunlight almost all day.  The cord was plenty long enough for that and the charge popped up to 100 percent from 52 percent in just a few hours.  Admittedly it is full summer in southern california but I anticipate the panel will be able to keep the battery at a reasonable charge with much less sunlight than I am giving it.  So much better than having to drag a ladder out climb up and take the battery out to charge.  I love it!
5,This little solar panel checks all the boxes. I paired this with a ring spot light and mounted on a gutter mount.  Tight compact and looks great.  Would purchase again.
5,Easy to put up and use on my ring camera
4,Item is not functioning from the "get go." Contacted Wasserstein and reported problem and the offered to send a replacement. Very good service.
5,Nice packaging and presentation tops off the batteries in just a few hours. Mounting hardware is included. I do wish the mount was more versatile but that's because my conditions are unique the bracket should suffice for most everyone else. All in all a good value and will buy again.
5,The ring light/camera is a great device.  It did draw a lot of power and required battery charging often.  The solar charger was easy to install and keeps the battery topped off.  Very pleased so far.
5,It works perfect with my stick up cam in the driveway. I’ve had it for about two months now and haven’t had issues with it it kept my camera charged and I don’t have to worry about battery going dead when I’m away from home. Good purchase!
5,This panel is identical to my first generation Ring brand panels and superior to the “new” Ring panels. My panels get only partial day sunlight. The current generation of Ring panels have a smaller collection area than these panels and do not keep my spotlight camera charged. Ring is now selling a “Pro” version for twice the price. Go with this panel and you will save significantly.
5,I purchased one of these about a year ago and another more recently. This allows my ring cameras designed to work on battery power to remained charged without the extra hassle of running electrical to the cameras or having to go up and take out the batteries to recharge them.
5,This is the same product as the one that sold by Ring. I have them both and they both works the same. Base on my setup it is better to have two (2) batteries in every camera for a rainy day or in the high traffic areas.However just a few days after I got this product installed it and forgot about it... (believe me I really did wanted to forget about changing batteries in my camera) the Ring had a promotion for their own solar panels which was $10 less the this one. Well... life has its surprises... and $10 did not worth a hassle of climbing urban cliffs and repelling back from the steepness of my roof...
4,I installed this at probably the worst time of year December in Michigan. Very cold and not enough sun. It basically didn’t charge unless the temp was above 30 and then only a few %. However now as the days are getting warmer and sunnier it’s charging well  I basically had to shut the camera down for a week that was sunnier to give it time to charge up and now both batteries at at or near 100% all the time.
5,I own a ring solar panel along with this one. It’s worth every penny! Both panels appear to be similar to one another. Not only is it cheaper than ring’s solar panel but it connects well (and charges) with my ring spotlight camera. Great value and product!
4,It's as expected of what the description said. Easy to put up and after a week it's still working great.
5,We have purchased 3 wasserstein solar panels to go with our ring spotlight battery cameras.  The solar panels work great.  They definitely need to placed where the panel receives hours of daylight.  Our front panel is full sun and keeps the battery charged at 90 to 100%. Our back panel is mostly shade so we bought the gutter mount for the panel and now our camera stays at 100%. The solar panels work very well just best in full sun.  Easy to set up.  Definitely recommend.  The company also emailed to make sure we were pleased with the product.  We had a question and received a quick response.
5,This was so easy to setup and it is working great
5,Works great with our ring camera in our backyard. Charges it very well and we never have to worry about charging the batteries inside the house at all. Would recommend and buy again if need another.
4,Unit only in operation for a short time. Appears to be keeping the camera battery charged easily - 90% to 100% within 3 hours. Current average daily direct sun exposure approximately 4 hours. Northern location with typical heavy cloud cover during the winter months. Remains to be seen how things will go over the winter but I'm expecting no problems. For me optimal mount location (IE more sun) would require longer cord set from panel to camera. Am researching and will buy if available. So far happy with the product.
5,Great product and reliable!!
5,Was skeptical about if this was worth buying and questioned how well it would work or if at all for the price. I was amazingly suprised! After a late afternoon installation with one battery at 10% and the other at 50% the next afternoon the batteries had nearly fully charged. I havent had to charge the batteries since installing with a ton of movement traffic at night with the spotlight turning on. The batteries are at 100 % by 1 pm every day. GREAT PRODUCT! A steal at the price.
5,This is my first solar anything and it’s doing what it says it will do. Had it about a week or so and I’m going to buy another when I get paid.
5,Works great with the camera.  Saves on charging/changing battery
5,I fitted a new Ring battery spotlight camera to add to my Ring camera network - love these devices superb technology.  I purchased a Ring solar panel for one of the other cameras and that worked really well. Thought I would give this one a go for the new camera. It arrived promptly and was easy to fit. It worked right out of the box and withing 2 hours took the battery level on the new camera from 93% to 100% just like the Ring solar panel. Looks good very happy so far. Please note that we do get a lot of direct sun in the Bahamas so that helps!
5,Easy to hook up and keeps the battery charged on my spotlight cam. allows me to up the capture rate and still not have to take the battery out to charge.
5,Happy to report after some very rainy weather and now some sunny days have come my battery has finally hit 100%. I am glad I bought this instead of buying a second battery . Where I have the camera installed means climbing up on a ladder to remove the battery recharge it and then go back up on the ladder to put it back. That would have been a real headache especially in the winter. Now the solar panel does the recharging for me. This panel cost less than Ring’s panel yet does the exact same thing. I’m happy.
4,Installed ok. Wasnt hard. Only had it up a week. It seems to keep the battery at full charge. The Co. should ask for a review after a few months of the panel being out in the weather/elements not the first few days. Ask me in 6 months. If it still performs like now/new i would give 5 stars
5,I used this for the ring security light with the battery. I have it at our cabin and so far it’s been fine great product.
5,My solar panel arrived before the expected date.  It installed easily and started capturing solar power right away.  It was installed two days ago and continues to keep the charge on the battery inside my Ring device at 100%.  I am completely happy with this product.
5,If you are thinking of getting the Battery Security Camera by Ring I heartily recommend this solar panel.  I installed this at my mother's house and only purchased one to try it out.  I should have bought one for each camera!  I have already had to change the battery on the camera without the panel and it has only been a week!  The camera with the solar panel is doing wonderfully.  I think this is a perfect "set & forget" solution which eliminates the need to run power to the camera.  Very easy to install and works wonderfully I recommend it very highly without any reservations whatsoever.
5,A great product
5,This is just as good if not better than the more expensive brand. Keeps the batteries charged in my camera.
5,Works perfectly with the ring and as a small additional feature makign the mount and direction tot he sun more flexible. So far working perfectly so no real reason not to buy the for all the ring equipment.
5,Works as promised keeps my ring stick up cam charged
5,The item performance has been outstanding so far
5,Definitely good value for my money and saves me time and effort because I don't have to charge batteries any more.
5,The solar panel keeps my ring stick up camera fully charged.  I  contacted their support as my battery was charging very little (a few percentage) every day.  Their support was quick and helpful and told me to fully charge the battery first.  Once I did that the solar panel keeps the battery fully charged.  I am very happy with the solar panel as it is cheaper than Ring’s product and works as well.  I would purchase another if I buy another camera.
4,The mounting bracket could have been a little more versatile. I have a tile roof and it sticks out over the eves quite a bit so maybe a longer stem would have helped. Other than that so far so good.
5,Well done
5,Bought this for a hard-to-reach light and has been a game-changer. I no longer have to replace the battery has been charged for over a month now. Would definitely recommend it.
5,Used this in two locations for my ring battery cam.  Several months now and all my batteries are listing as fully charged. I wish they used metal for the support structures but no one does.  I fear they will fracture over time and are a pain to restructure for mounting...but the solar aspect on this one is quite good and a perfect match/mount with my cameras.
5,I have had this thing in the sun for about 2 years now and it has no signs of wear or performance issues
5,I am very happy with the results of this solar panel I've installed it on my Ring Stickup cam I waited for my stickup cam battery to drop to 25 percent before installing the solar panel. After installing and a full 12 hours of sunshine my cam battery charged to a whopping 69 percent. The only issue I had was with installing solar panel to Stickup Cam directions didn't say to remove the rubber pieces under the existing screws in the back of the cam found this tidbit of info on internet so far great product would highly recommend.
5,We love how easily it mounted and the length of the cord that plugs into the camera.
4,Everything went great. Still waiting to set it up.
5,The installation for this is very easy (depending on where you decide to mount it).  Two screws hold the panel in place and is very sturdy seems to easily support the weight of the panel once mounted which itself is very lightweight.The panels charge the spotlight cam very quickly. I am running one battery per camera and overnight battery loss is 2 to 3 percent. In indirect sunlight I am at 100% by 9 am every morning which was my initial concern prior to purchase.My panels arrived days before my cameras which were ordered at the same time so shipping was great.
5,Having the Ring spotlight on my garage became a problem almost from the start because we were running the battery down pretty quickly every time we came in and out.  That means a step stool and unscrewing the device in order to get to the battery to recharge it.  We got the solar panel and it's fantastic!  It's never below 98% except for rainy days it's 96%!  Worth every cent.  Have not had to charge since!
1,It’s taken a month and counting to just get a link to purchase the screws that attach the cord to the back of the Ring. After a month I was given diameters and lengths in mm. I converted those and found out those screws are way too big and for the hinge. Now they’re checking with the “internal team” again (of several times) (isn’t customer service internal as well to the company?). I’ve asked 7-8 times for them to just send or sell me spare screws. They are easily lost or stripped. “We don’t sell spare parts is the response each time.” From first query with them to now it’s been over a month. When it comes down to it this is what you’re dealing with. Customer service that is extremely slow doesn’t fully understand their product and doesn’t care about finding an easy solution even if you hand it to them multiple ways (like me) and remain patient.
5,So this is the second solar panel we've bought for our Ring system so far and we like this one better than the actual Ring solar panel. My husband said the mounting set up for this one was even better than the panel that's actually meant for Ring lolFully charged the first day facing east. Very satisfied!
5,Loved how easy it was to connect also noticed how its identical to the Ring branded solar panel. Fits perfectly make sure you remove the rubber gaskets from the camera so it fits.  Also remember to ast the gaskets to the two mounting screws as well as the power pin that goes into the back of the camera.  I plugged the panel in while the camera had 13% battery within a few days it jumped to 72%.
5,Lack of charging capabilities
5,Works fantastic. Easy to install and connect.
5,This is a great product for the price. I have my Ring spot light cam set up for standard but I still would have to change my battery every other week. By purchasing this product I haven't changed the battery since I installed it. This save time on getting my ladder out the storage climbing the ladder and replacing the battery. Thanks Ring I love this product.
5,Me agradó mucho el producto porque está práctico fácil de colocar y funciona muy bien
5,I was skeptical about this solar panel. However after using I for a couple of weeks I am completely happy with it. It works just like the Ring panel just much more affordable. I have my Ring battery cam installed to watch a busy street so it’s always going off (which then draws a lot of battery). However with the solar panel and a good amount of direct sunlight the battery stays above 93% all the time.It dips into the 80s when the sun goes down but it goes right back up when the sun is out.
5,I am thrilled - battery charge went up instead of down.  I am thrilled I won’t have to climb the ladder.Wasn’t clear how to install.  Almost returned it when it didn’t fit but the second Ring unit had the right opening already available.  Then it was obvious.  I do wish it contained a clip for the cord as it needs to be pulled away from the unit so it doesn’t interfere with the camera.
5,I ordered a two pack of Ring security spotlights and a two pack of these solar chargers.  These connected easily to the spotlights and came with a long wire.  They keep the batteries fully charged.  It's easy to check the battery level on the Android app.  You can also add a second battery to each spotlight but I have not needed them.  I usually give pros and cons and no more than 4 stars (because I usually don't read the 5 star ratings).  But there are no cons so far hence the 5 star rating.
5,This is far better than the Ring solar panel. It’s 200% worth it.
4,This was my alternative to running a electric source to my outside Ring camera that was requiring me to climb on a ladder once a week to change the battery. It seems to be working very well. My battery now has remained at 98% for a month.  Thanks Chris!!
5,I purchased a ring camera and love purchased one to try out because I wasn’t sure if it was going to work. I have now added these solar panels to all my outdoor ring cameras. Even on a cloudy the solar panels charge and keep my ring cameras charged. I would recommend this product for any one.
1,I've only been using this for about 6 months and it has already stopped charging my ring camera.
5,Very easy to install and it works perfectly. My Ring battery was down to 10% and after being installed on Sunday it's now Tuesday and its at 89%. This particular panel only gets about 6 hours of direct sunlight.
5,Looks good.  Just set it up today.  Misplaced the instructions and none appeared to be available on line.  I was trying to find out if I could rotate the mount.  So far it is fixed position.  We will see charging tomorrow.
4,this solar panel keeps my only chargeable battery of my ring camera at a constant 100%. with this result i don’t need to buy a second battery anymore.
4,Bought as a gift seems small and simple to use.
5,We’ve had this up for about a week and the battery is currently at 97% which is excellent as we have had a lot of cloudy days. I’m very pleased. The instructions could have been a little better in terms of the screws and rubber washers but not too hard to figure out. Overall it’s great and I would recommend it.
5,No
5,You will never have to charge or plug in your batteries again.🏜
5,Top quality and easy install.  All hardware is included.  Installed and hooked it up to ring camera and is working great.  Would recommend this product to all.
5,I have 2 Ring cameras on the back side of my house. The sun doesn't hit back there until later afternoon. After about two days of overcast weather both cameras (each of which had completely dead batteries) we're about 25% charged. They've had 100% charge consistently since a few days after install. Great product.
5,Works great. I don't have an electrical outlet in the area my camera is mounted so I needed solar power for my camera. I bought another brand that was made for my Ring camera but could not get it to work. Ring worked with me to try to find a solution but finally I sent it back and bought the Ring solar panel and it works perfect. One complaint I have is that Ring was out of the white panels and wouldn't have any in for months so I had to pay $20 more to a supplier that had the white one.
4,i wish it wiuld have encluded  a moire verital mount
5,I was getting tired of charging batteries on my Spotlight Cam which is not in an easy place to get to.  Went with this small solar panel and it works as advertised.  I had a battery with a 54% charge in the morning go to 85% charged by the end of day.  It's probably not installed in the best of spots and it was a partly sunny day so chances are it could do even better under ideal conditions.  Overall I'm happy with this purchase.
3,I gave this Unit 3 stars 1 star off for sending me a used Solar panel and 1 star off for the screw holes not aligning to secure the power plug in the Ring unit.But it DOES charge the batteries in the Ring Spotlight Cam. I was worried for about 2 days when I saw nothing happen charging wise then it started and has kept them (I have 2 batteries in the  Ring) at 100%.  Cannot explain why it took 2 days to start charging but it has been working fine since then.The plug as stated cannot be secured with the screws since the holes do not line up.  But there is enough friction from the plug being inserted that it stays in place with no problem.
5,Battery on the woreless camera kept draining every two weeks. Drag out the ladder pull the camera down charge the battery for 12 hours drag ladder back out install camera get the right view again...did that scenario about three times before ordering the solar panel.Easiest thing ever to install. Mounted the solar panel where it will get optimum sunshine from morning until about 12-1pm. After installing the solar panel and a few good days of sun we are at 100% charge. Going to buy another solar panel for the front porch camera!!
5,This panel took less than 15 min to install and start charging my Ring Stick Up Cam.  I liked having the option of white or black too.
4,The panel was fairly easy to install and is working so far as advertised. The only thing I would like to see would be a better mount that would allow a full 360 degree adjustability along with a full 180+ degree range of motion. It took some creativity to get the mount and panel so that it would catch the maximum amount of sunlight.
5,This solar panel works PERFECT.. I waited about a month before writing a review... the solar panel has worked great... my battery dropped down to 91% a week ago due to rain and heavy cloud cover and as soon as the sun came out it was back at 100% I am very satisfied with this product!!
5,It works exactly like the description said it would. It took a couple days for my battery cam to fully charge up to 100%.  I notice at night it drops to 98- 99% but right back to a 100%  the next day.It was very easy to set up and I am over 75  Little scary on the ladder but I could do it.  The company sent several emails wanting to know if all was ok. I really appreciated that. Overall you get a good product for a small amount of money.
3,Overall it works. They keep my camera batteries charged near full during the day.Issues: Does not provide drill size for the provided wall anchors. Included in a small package of screws to attach to the camera are 3 small rubber(?) washers (2 different sizes). These washers are not mentioned in the instructions. I use two to go on the screws but as the screwed neared being tightened those washers squeezed down and then popped off. The versatility of the barrel of the wall mount would be greatly enhanced if it were able to turn 90 degrees and if it would telescope at least to twice its current length.
4,Na
5,Fully charges the Ring Spotlight cam up to 100% everyday. It is mounted on the south facing wall in Texas so plenty of sunlight. It looks pretty nice too fitting well on the bit of wall on the side of my garage door.
5,I love theses panels.  I have them for all my ring battery cams to prevent me from climbing ladders to change the battery.  I get great sunlight exposure so my batteries are always charged!
5,We have had no problems with panel. Arrived very timely!! Works really well!!
5,Life saver for my rechargeable batteries. When I first installed it I was not impressed with it but it was cloudy and battery was still being drained. Once we had he sunny days come in. Wow a game changer battery got to a 100% fully charge. Happy with it and saves time for me to be climbing over and over a ladder. Have a dog on backyard where camera is and used to drain it . Now battery gets drained but get fully charged in a day.
5,Not sure how to rate warmth or sheerness.But the panel so far has worked well. Keeps both batteries charged. Simple to install and is unobtrusive.Well see how it holds up to California sun over time.
5,Fairly simply to install works perfectly and keeps my Ring cam charged. Battery was at 30% at install up to 78% after a week.Worst part of the Stick Up cam is having to charge the battery externally. Was between a second battery and the solar panel. My decision was a no brainer. Stuck it on my garage roof and now I never have to worry about recharging my cam again.
5,Works like the name brand. Purchased a name brand and this one. They work the same. Easy to install. Comes with everything you need. Built solid and costs less. Would buy again.
5,Works well and strong
5,It was an excellent purchase. Very happy with the quality for the money. It was easily mounted in a partly shaded area but still maintains 100% battery on my Ring Spotlight Cam with all the motion detection and image capture settings set to the same as my plugged in Ring cameras.
5,This worked just like the Ring version at a better price. Does a good job of keeping my batteries charged on my outdoor Ring camera.
5,Very pleased with the solar panel so far.  It started charging the battery in our ring camera as soon as it was hooked to it. It took 3 days to get a 100% charge and so far it is worth the money just not having to climb a ladder to remove battery from camera to recharge and replace.  It doesn't seem to tip up but that's not an issue as long as it is keeping the battery charged.
5,Yo keep my backyard camera powered all the time. Works great
5,Keeps both batteries in my ring charged at 100%.
5,It was easy to install and works perfectly with our Ring Camera.  The Ring camera battery takes a ridiculous time to charge so it is nice to just have it hooked up to Solar which keeps it charged.
5,Dont bother buying a second battery this solar panel is all u need. It was super simple to install and I have no complaints. Battery stays fully charged at 100% and goes down to 99% but never lower than that. Will definitely be buying more and recommending to my friends and family.
4,I’ve had it for a month and no problems yet. Except that it charges the battery on my ring camera ALL day but the battery level in the middle of the night seems kind of low.
5,The panel works fine when the sun is out but our Northwest weather is heavy overcast for days and prevents reliable charging. Thus I keep a backup battery for the weeks of extended overcast.
5,Bought this for our Ring Spotlight Camera. I have read several 1star reviews on this but I can say they were wrong! It fit perfectly and the provided screws secured the power cord to the camera. The mount was great and better than the Ring panel mounts because it will swivel. The panel took my battery from 12% to 100% in a matter of days. It's worth the cost over the Ring solar panel.
4,The solar panel work well with Ring  Spot cam.  Cable connection  to Ring not quite line up exactly with screw holes but it flexible enough to force tightening.  Not a big issue a small thing compared to how much I save than buying authentic brand name.
5,I’ve had this installed with my Ring spotlight cam for about a month.  So far it’s great.  It keeps my devices fully charged.
5,Bought this to attach to our backyard ring cam without having to swap out a battery this thing works great.  Have it on a north end of the house tilted east and I’ve never seen less than 90% on the battery life.  Long cord so you’ll have the length to run it where you need to and get the best access to sunlight.
5,Works just fine. The cam even recognizes it as a solar charger in the app. Keeps my battery above 95% at all times.
5,the price is right will have to see how long it last through the hot  summer season. So far so good 3mo now no complaints.
5,A must buy if you have a ring camera.  I have never had to charge the batteries on any of my ring camera using this solar panel
1,Even though is advertised to work with the Ring Stick Up Cam it will NOT. First I returned and got another panel to see if a defective panel was the issue but no. Replacement panel was not working either. Had to purchase the Ring brand panel. Instead of saving money save your time.
5,This is my 3rd purchase of this item and they all work great!
5,Easy install and charged up my Ring camera nicely- no more ladder climbing to recharge the battery.
5,Product installed and working . Product arrived in promised time and I am extremely satisfied with it. I have already recommended it to others.TY
5,Same price as a ring battery and keeps the unit charged above 95%. My backyard Ring would die in less than a week due to my dog going in and out triggering a recording. After installing the solar panel it has not dipped below 95%. Considering this is about the same price as a second battery it is well worth it considering you don't have to charge batteries. Highly recommend for those who live in sunny location. Super easy to install.
3,I needed to replace an existing solar panel the lasted 2 years in the Las Vegas sun. I chose a preowned solar panel that Amazon certified in good condition and complete. When I received it it was just the solar panel missing the bracket and screws. Luckily I was just replacing a panel of the same make and size and could reuse the mounting bracket.Disappointed this was not caught at Amazon.
5,My camera is in a shaded area.  Just mounting the panel on my deck railing keeps the camera 100% charged each day.  I suppose a smaller panel with a longer cable might make more sense but unless your camera is in a closet this product should keep it charged.  I no longer need to climb a ladder to change the battery.
5,The install took 3 minutes. I read on other reviews the plug didn't fit correctly but for me zero issues. As I've been checking the camera battery it is staying fully charged on medium settings.
5,This works great with my Ring Spotlight Cams.  I have 3 cams each with one of these panels.  This latest one I bought only gets sun for about half the day and it's holding a full charge on the battery at all times.  So very pleased.  I think they're a little expensive for what they are.  But no complaints for getting what I paid for.
5,Saved $10 by buying this brand instead of the Ring brand and it works perfectly!!!  No complaints and planning on buying additional panels
5,Does a fantastic job as long as the sun is shining. In Michigan we can go days without sun and end up having to recharge the battery anyways.
5,Works great for an awesome price!!
5,Works just as well as the Ring brand panel I have attached to my second stick up camera. Both cameras stay charged and work great.
5,Works great with my indoor/outdoor cam
4,Shipment arrived quickly. Installation was easy probably took me about an hour and that's because I had to readjust the camera. Just make sure that you pick a spot that gets plenty of sun. So far so good!!
5,I could not recommend this product more! I have two of these solar panels installed on two ring spot light cams (1 per camera) for 4 months now. The batteries are still reading 99% full. I did not expect them to work this well. Side note: I only have 1 better per camera.
5,Works as it should
5,I purchased this product to avoid having to replace batteries on my Ring devices. I live in sunny SoCal and this very reasonably priced solution has been perfect! The panel keeps the battery charged at 100%. The included mounting bracket made it easy to install. Best part is no more climbing up and down ladders to change batteries.
5,This solar panel works! Saw some negative reviews but went ahead. Its 15 bucks cheaper than the name brand and the quality of materials matches the ring battery cam perfectly. It charged the battery from 85% to 100% in a single day. Ive only had a it a few days so no idea on longevity yet but im very pleased with this solar panel. So far its a definite recommendation to keep your outdoor battery camera charged.
5,Not hooked up yet. So no real answer for quality
