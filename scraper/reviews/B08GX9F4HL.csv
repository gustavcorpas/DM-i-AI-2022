5,This really is my favorite backpack and I have owned plenty. I have traveled extensively with it as my personal item on planes and have had no issues with size. It compresses very nicely and has plenty of pockets and features such as pockets for pens laptop water bottle and attachment for charging your phone with a power brick. The arm straps are easily adjustable and it has a handle on top to carry. I also like that it doesn't have too many straps and clips hanging from it like many others.There is also a horizontal strap so you can slide it on your carry-on handle.
4,I got this backpack for college and it has done a pretty good job so far. I keep quite a bit of stuff in my backpack during the semester and have heavy textbooks on top of that so I'd say its doing a pretty good job of keeping up with the heavy load. It rained the one day and I didn't have an umbrella so it got wet but as far as I could tell nothing inside got wet. I also flew home with it for a weekend and it was a good size for traveling on an airplane. The only down side to it is that it can only hold so many of my textbooks at the same time I wish it was just a tad bigger so I could carry more of my books at once.
5,I purchased this backpack for my 7th grader and we both love it. It has many compartments zippers and even a built in charger. I find myself purchasing backpacks yearly for the new school year and it's a pain. This is a backpack that will last for years to come. It's sturdy and holds well. Comfortable straps so your shoulders don't ache. It's a must buy!
5,I used this to travel on. Three day trip via ferry to BC. It held all my things held up well to my overpacking! It does have a papery noise when empty but that was unnoticeable when full. Sturdy and very functional.  Lots of pockets! I recommend it!
5,I bought 1 of these he few months ago when my daughter got a new laptop computer. She liked it so much that when the new school year came around I bought 2 more 1 for her 1 for her brother. These backpacks are sturdy comfortable to wear And come with a pocket on the inside to holder charge pack. A plug on the inside attaches the charge back to an external USB port. This allows them to charge their devices outside of the bag. Very satisfied.
5,Backpack is great for school it can hold my chromebook notebooks and more with no problem I've yet to try the charging feature though. It has so much storage and many hidden pockets. The inside is not cloth so if anything spilled it wouldn't be super difficult to clean. It has a holder for your water bottle on the side but only for smaller bottles like 18oz or less my big water bottle kept falling out. Nevertheless I like the backpack a lot :)
5,Superó mis expectativas. A mi hijo le encanta para ir a la escuela tiene muchos compartimientos y uno especial para la laptop.Totalmente impermeable.Y puedes cargar tu celular.La recomiendo 100%.
4,I bought this to take on an overseas trip I needed a pack that would hold a lot & strap onto my luggage handle and this fit the bill. I will say you can easily overpack this and it will be difficult to stow under an airplane seat and heavy to carry. The only real downfall I could see is the side pockets are way to short to hold a water bottle mine kept falling out.
5,Recently purchased this backpack for nursing school and couldn’t be happier with my purchase. I’ve been able to carry all my books laptop and notebooks and it’s very comfortable. Lots of pockets for more organizing and storage as well. Highly recommend.
5,Bought this for my high schooler who has too much to carry IMO. The backpack is holding up so far with that heavy load. It has many pockets looks simple and sleek and the girl loves it so far.
5,I absolutely love this backpack! I originally bought to use as my carry-on for my 10-day girls trip overseas. The pockets durability and size made this perfect for traveling!Additionally I recently began law school and this is the perfect bag for me. I have a lot of heavy books notebooks my computer etc to carry and this backpack holds everything and keeps me organized. It’s also pretty comfortable considering I have to walk across the city to get to class. Recommend!
4,My son has loved this bag! It has alot of room which comes in handy for all of his books he has to have. Only bad thing is both side pockets that he puts his water bottles in has developed a hole in both. Other than that lots of room and seems sturdy!
5,The size and weight and shape. I used it to travel as my luggage for a 5 day trip
5,Built well held everything I needed it to hold.
5,Bought this for my kids cause everyone has a laptop now. It protects the laptop and it’s a sturdy bag. Love all the storage.
5,The bag fits me so comfortably considering I’m plus sized. It fits normally on me. The pockets are so well put on  it gives you so much areas + 1 secret pocket in the back. And it doesn’t make you sweaty! Perfect bag for highschool carrying all my items
5,I've had this backpack for almost 3months. During this time. It has been my favorite travel companion. At the time I was traveling alot for work and needed to store laptops and electronics. As well as personal items. It was enough pockets and space for me. Unfortunately one of the straps broke a couple weeks ago. But I still use it. As far durability I would give it a 2 stars due to the strap but overall it's my favorite backpack. I'll keep using it til maybe the other strap (knock on wood) breaks.
5,Backpack was bigger than I thought but my daughter loved all the space it has.
4,Would’ve like if it was water proof
4,It is very comfortable and lightweight.  Easy to travel with.  The only issue with mine is that the USB plug for battery charging does not work.  Other than that it still seems like a good bargain.
4,We got this for my son who is a freshman in high school and Carrie’s so much stuff! Worked great for him! Lots of space
4,I have mixed feelings about this backpack. It’s adorable and very comfortable to wear. It passes the Airport personal item carry size. You can fit a lot of things into the bag the pockets are very deep. But the deep pockets was also an annoyance. It was hard to find the things I need it when it was time to grab them out the bag because it was they were so damn deep in the pockets. I also don’t like the water bottle holder my bottled water kept falling out.
4,This seems to be a great product. The only thing I take issue with is that you can never tell how much charge the pack has. Every time I try to charge my laptop it seems like the pack hasn't kept the charge at all
5,Well made and big enough for organization
5,I have the bag for under 3 mouths and its falling apart. I should realize when they only give 30 day warranty..
5,I have used this bag for travel and school. Size is just right for essentials.  Probably not big enough if you carry a lot of large binders or notebooks.  It has held up well so far.  The straps are well padded and comfortable even when carrying weighty items.
4,Very good for traveling
4,the gray is a lot darker than in the pictures- otherwise good backpack!
4,I really like this bag! It has deep pockets and many different zippered sections to hold your items whether big or small. I’m currently using it for a work bag as my previous bag (from a different brand) broke. It would work well as a school bag too. There’s a deep laptop pocket. The back of the bag is well padded for comfort as well. The straps are easy to adjust.I’m impressed with it being waterproof as well. I walked with this bag in a decent rain storm and the bag stayed dry on the inside along with all of my items.The only downside is the 2 drink holders. They’re decently large & semi-deep but there’s not a second strap to hold a larger water bottle in. I’ve had my water bottle knocked out of my bag by quickly turning around with this backpack. The pockets themselves just aren’t quite enough to keep a larger water bottle in without falling out with movement.
5,It not only looks great but it is very sturdy. Many school backpacks fall apart very quickly but this one seems to be able to withstand high school.
5,Bought for my wife her review: Awesome back pack! I bought it for work to carry my laptop and it does the job and then some! It’s small but holds so much! I now use it for traveling too! I love my under armor backpack (still do) but have replaced it for traveling with this back pack due to its smaller compact size that can fit so many items! So many compartments. Love love love it!
5,I had luggage for a carry-on but I needed a backpack for my plane ride home. This was perfect! Fit under the seat in front of me with no problem! Plenty of pockets!
5,I haven't spilled anything on it so can't grade it's water res but it's comfylarge and very spacious
5,All the pockets on the backpack are pretty deep. That is a bit of a problem for wherever I stick my keys because they always sink to the bottom. That being said that’s why they put the key hook in the backpack but I wish it was just a clip so I wouldn’t have to decide which set of keys I use to put on it.
4,I ordered the red and a black one. They are nice just  a little smaller then I expected but it'll work
5,I like this backpack it's durable and holds alot of items I can fit a sweater jacket magazine chromebook tablet multiple pens gloves flashlight accessory pouch and a few other things inside I would like to see heavy duty zippers instead of the standard zippers but other than that I'm happy with the purchase
5,I purchased this bag thinking it might last even less then the really expensive bags. I've had it for a while already and im suprised its lasted this long. The other bags i buy usually start showing wear n tear around the bottom or the zipper starts giving me issues since im constantly opening and closing the bag. Overall great product and im very happy with the purchase
5,It hardly got wet but my stuff got wet though the bag dried fast there was a puddle of water that got into the bag even thought it was closed
5,This is a nice bag with several pockets and hidden compartments. The charging port is a nice touch. It also comes with a zipper lock to keep your laptop safe or valuables. Overall good purchase.
5,Very comfortable to wear and fits everything you need!
5,Got this for my son and he love it.
5,This bag is full if space! I will use it for school and it has space for binders books and my laptop.
5,Lots of room and great as a carry on
5,Son loves it.  Perfect backpack for him.
4,Can hold a LOT of stuff. Lots of pockets good storage.  Has held up well so far. I use it for an everyday bag.  It is fairly light weight.  At this point I would purchase it again.
5,I needed a durable backpack while traveling that would also have space for my laptop and charging cable. This backpack is not only attractive and durable but it has SO MANY pockets and cubbies to help me stay organized while away from home.  The added padding to protect my devices the handy strap to attach the backpack to my luggage handle and the comfortable shoulder straps were invaluable getting through the airport with all my "stuff". I haven't used the included USB charging port yet but I like having that available to me if I need it!  I'm using this backpack on our long road trip now and it's working great to keep the things I need close by.  I'm delighted that I found this particular item on AMazon.
5,Got this from my niece and it worked perfectly
5,Had no complaints with the bag. Everything was great.
5,Good quality backpacks with multiple compartments for organizing and function.
5,Super comfy
5,Very happy with this bag.  Has a lot of room for books and computer.
5,It’s everything the description said it is. Definitely recommend it.
5,This is my third book bag I brought from Amazon and buy far the best it’s is stylist And it has lasted the longest. Very heavy duty
5,I use this backpack as my carry all purse. It is great! I have plenty of room for my stuff and then some. Love that I can attach my own power bank and use the charging port on the outside of the bag. The lock that comes with the bag has instructions on how to change the code to whatever you want. I'm happy with this purchase.
4,Backpack was great for what I needed it for however I thought the backpack would have a charging function but rather it was more of a cord extension having to be plug the backpack into the outlet then into my device. Backpack lacks any kind of electronic storage (Battery) to store the electric so it would need to remain plugged in to its power source at all times.
5,This backpack has a lot of room and compartments which allow you to stay organized while traveling and for work.  It has held up well even when it is carrying a lot of weight.  It is comfortable to wear through endless airport terminals.  I would definitely buy this again.
3,The book bag is sturdy and the material is really good especially since it’s supposed to be water proof. HOWEVER my only pet peeve is that the water bottle holder straps on the sides are to tiny. If you have a long water bottle or umbrella it WILL constantly fall out because the mesh strap isn’t long enough to support it. Probably just best to use it for carrying books. Overall 3/5.
5,My husband luv this backpack. He uses it for work.
5,Love them ! We will be using them for a trip and they are awesome for our travel by plane!!
5,I love it
3,EDIT 3/8/22:Switched it from 4 stars to 3 stars. It has been 8 months and I moved onto a different more quality backpack. The amount of storage spots on this backpack were great but I could not get over the water bottle mesh pockets on the side of the backpack being too small and short. Was tired of having my water bottle fall out when I leaned too much or bend down to tie my shoe or pick up my groceries. After getting the new backpack I realized that it does look like this backpack is filled with stuff all the time as my new backpack is pretty flat with the same amount of stuff in there.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I have been using this backpack for work for over 3 months now. Some days I carry my laptop to and from work.Pros:- Lots of pockets and slots to keep things in- Lots of space to put things in such as my laptop a jacket my purse etc. without looking huge when there is not a lot of items in there.- Padded straps do not hurt my shoulders- External charging port is nice for traveling and needing to charge my phone and have it still accessible- External material for the backpack seems durable- The black color is sleek- PriceCons:- Some of the internal pockets are thin and seems like that can rip easily such as the one that divides the laptop pocket in two so you could put power cables or something in that pocket and not scratch up your laptop- The water bottle slots on the side are short so although my 32 oz camelbak water bottle fits if I lean over then the water bottle falls out and gets damages or damages the ground such as my laminate flooring at home. Also the bottle always leans when I put my backpack against the wall so the bottle is tilted.- The shoulder straps seem like they may rip at the seam at some point due to the ok qualityOverall my biggest gripe is the water bottle slots because I bought a backpack specifically to be able to carry my laptop and water bottle yet the water bottle slot is flimsy and always falls over. However I am still using it as my daily (looking for a water bottle carrying solution) because I appreciate the amount of internal and external pockets for me to store items in.  I hope the company will either increase the height of their water bottle compartments or add a strap so I can buckle the strap through the water bottle handle to secure it while traveling.
4,If your going to buy it recommend the bigger size and the anti theft is pretty much a small lock that you get with it. Did like the space where I can put my multi tool and charger at but thought it came with battery for you to charge not you having  to get one yourself
5,I really like this backpack. The price made me a little nervous in regard to quality but it is pretty great. I love all the compartments and the color.
5,My daughter loves this back pack!
5,Great for commuting college  students ans traveling
4,I liked this product but didn't get to use it yet
5,Like the variety of pocket sizes. Different function of compartments and very useful to have padded compartment for my work laptop. Love the strap on the back that allows me to slide my backpack on the handle of my rolling cart for meetings. Love the key hook as well on the inside so I will always find my keys to the office when I place them there. So far it has been pretty durable (over 6 months) even when I’ve packed it kind of full.
5,sturdy waterproof comfortable very roomy.
4,The back pack is nice but was damaged when I got it.  A box knife or a knife slash was on the top of the back pack .  I was very disapointed
5,I use this backpack all the time.  It is amazingly comfortable to wear. There are a ton of pockets and so much storage! Soft padding makes it great for trips or just taking up into the mountains.  Definitely worth it
5,I use it for work right material
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I love how it has a portable charger also my bookbag with a lock
3,I'm a substitute teacher and used this backpack to keep my school "supplies" in. I love the functionality of this backpack. Lots of pockets tons of storage great padding so it's comfortable to carry ... but it barely lasted 9 months before the front pocket started coming apart at the seams. Soon after the seam on the other side started to come apart and about 3 months ago the seam on the strap started to detach. Unfortunately the seams are sewn on the very edge of the fabric and not reinforced so there's no way to repair it.I know it's not a Jansport and it lasted almost a year so for $20ish I guess I got my use out of it. But the rest of the backpack looks brand new so it's not like it's been through a ton of wear and tear and I expected it to last longer than it did.I'm debating buying another one because I love everything else about it but first I have to wrap my mind around the fact that this is a "disposable" backpack that will only last about a year.
5,I'll add photos later I promise. I fell in love once I unwrap this package. They had it neatly wrapped in clear packaging but once opened the bag unfolded to a glorious amount of expanded space I could not possibly expect. The color did not matter to me at all for the price so I am truly pleased with all the compartments it has to store my photography things or just laptops and tablets safely. I am excited it has a USB port which I have on the charger now to see how well that works also with my phones and things like that. This is the best gift that I could possibly give myself. It appears to be well made so I am trusting that it is. If not I will revise this review at a later date. I receive the grey and black one.
5,My daughter loves it. Wonderful convenience of having a built in charger.
4,Now I have traveled several times with it as personal items it's safe to review it. It worked very good with enough spaces to pack a 15" laptop plus a tablet with the 150W multiple ports charger. Spaces for two to three days change clothes and space to store phone also.Wish the the water bottle provision is a bit taller as the current bottle holder is not tall enough to hold the bottle in place securely. The bottle falls out too easy. (Several other pack also had the same problem seems like they all used too short a packet and no loop for additional hold.)
4,Overall its a good travel bag but the bottle holders are too small for 16 oz thermos. Organization is great enough pockets to place everything in its place. Straps arent the best if you open it up too much they will come off need to have at least 3 inches of slack so they dont come out.
5,travel to Europe
5,The description said red color but the picture looks pink.  It is indeed red my son likes it very much. It has good pockets and the charging port makes it easy to charge your phone. I would buy again.
4,Bought it for my son 11 years old  he needs a good big size bag back  also fit all his notebooks  my son and I like it  the  Material really good  Waterproof so whenever his water bottle is leaking notebooks are  safe . The price little bit high  you can find same bag  less price at Walmart /Target
5,Was pleasantly surprised with this backpack it's great your space for everything it's going to be great when I go to work this coming winter I'll be able to put my work shoes in the this backpack it will allow me to you no change when I get to work nice space you know for everything you might need during the day all around it's a great backpack. It's also going to be great when I get a new cellphone I'll have a place to charge it.
5,Took this to Disney world. Had so much stuff crammed in here and it didn't feel like it. Got rained on and nothing was wet at all! Multiple compartments to keep things separated. Super comfy all day long on the back. Highly suggest!
4,For the price you cannot ask for much else in backpack. It has enough room to wear I can carry a 15.6 inch laptop and a Chromebook and still have room for all my accessories and books as well. I even use it as an overnight back sometimes and will have enough room for my laptop and clothes as well. There are plenty of compartments  so you can separate your items how you like.  One of the zippers does not work properly but for the price I paid it is not that bug of deal. The water proofing is meh. I've been caught in torrential downpours and my laptop did get wet not enough to cause damage but enough to cause concern. Definitely worth the money still
5,I love this backpack! It has tons of pockets and is the perfect size for me. I’m 5’4” and was worried the backpack would be too big but is is perfect. The fabric and construction are very high quality and it is comfortable.
5,I bought my son a pretty nice laptop for his birthday and I wanted to get him a bag that he could put his laptop in to keep it safe but also could take to school with him in this bag is awesome the charging port actually does work which is so cool and totally alleviate the issue of my son never having a charge to sell phone LOL he actually loves it it’s a great size super comfortable to wear
5,Great on my Europe trip held up great and holds TONS of stuff
3,The zipper broke the second day of use…. Very disappointing. It was bought for school so when she actually started using it was a month after we bought it so we couldn’t get it replaced.
5,N/A
4,Ive been using this backpack since August (2021) and Ive loved it!! Although One of the main reasons I bought the backpack was because of the charging port BUTTT it doesnt even work. So that was disappointing 😅😅 And the cup holders - They just cant hold waterbottles cans anything really. I keep hair ties and trash in the sides and thats all they’re good for… But other than that i love this bag :))
4,Has Lots of pockets.. I have a 17” laptop and it’s a bit tight to get it .. backpack is smaller than I anticipated
5,loved it
5,Too heavy
3,A bit to large and bulky for my liking however it does the job
3,Simply not a good one for me.
3,Great condition. Seems to be durable. Many pockets. Not as big as I needed. Between binder and laptop the space is limited
5,I love this backpack for traveling! I use it for pretty much everything! There's tons of pockets for organizing and they have plenty of room. I can fit everything i need with room to spare and the cable is useful for portable charging when you're on the go. I recommend this product :)
5,had for over a month now and this is a great travel and business backpack!  super handy compartments for laptop and other electronics.  lots of conveniently places pockets that help keep everything organized. straps are really comfy and shoulder padding is great.  so far extremely pleased.  hopefully its as durable as im hoping!!!
5,Just perfect for what I wanted!
4,Not badBut not too big
5,I’m really digging this backpack. It has so many packets and has been a live saver for transporting my laptop and iPad to and from work.I can’t speak to the water resistance because I haven’t tried it out. But overall I am happy with this backpack.
3,Use for commuting and short trips.  Lock fell off and flimsy
3,Firstly I would love to comment on how this backpack is super great!There are so many pockets to fit all of my supplies it allows me to stay organized and know exactly where everything is. Super comfortable to wear regardless of weight. I carry four different notebooks two text books my pens and pencils then there is the convenience of two small front pockets one is used for items like gum charging cable makeup etc and the other one is used for my feminine hygienics which is amazing since I always felt like I needed to carry a max of 3 products for just those items but this backpack really allows you to carry so much of your personal belongings the charging port outside works great.And even thought that backpack itself is amazing the lock that came with the backpack doesn't seem to be registered to the default code of 000 so I don't have a way of unlocking it. Which sucks cause I honestly thought it was a great idea to prevent theft.
5,Bought this backpack for a recent travel it was comfortable to ware also with all the pockets made it super easy to have enough areas to store all of my personal items with more room to add other things! It was a great price! I shopped around before purchasing this bag and for this price I was surprised on how durable it is I would highly recommend this item!!!.
5,This backpack was exactly what I was looking for. It has plenty of room and the straps and padding for my back allows me to carry with ease. I highly recommend for anyone who carries multiple laptops and has a heart workload.
5,I used this product to travel via airport...it was useful because it helped organize my items and was able to reach for passports quickly. I was able to fit a folding toiletlaptop documents and many more items...I highly recommend this backpack.
5,This backpack is the perfect size for traveling. I’m able to fit both my work laptop and MacBook Air with no problem. It has a hidden pocket for valuables. Tons of room for everything I need to take with me on the plane. It’s comfortable to carry even though I fill it up. One of my best travel purchases ever.
5,Great back pack
5,Love this bag. Perfect for all my travels. Also the material is good and though and can hold a lot!
5,It’s affordable durable and spacious! Love it!
5,I absolutely love this backpack. One of my best purchases ever! One of the first things I did when I got it was test the water resistance. It truly works. It also has plenty of space for my huge 3 inch binder plus more. The charger works fantastic. I have to power bank plugged in inside my bag and then on the outside with ease I can plug my phone in on the go. I have a 30000 amh power bank and it works great. Its brought to charge my phone about 15 times. Then with my powerbank and the backpack combined it allows easy charging. The backpack is also extremely comfortable to wear around. This is a great buy for 20 bucks. It feels like it's worth 50.From here onwards is after I’ve had the bag for 6 months. If you are looking for a cheap quick 4 month solution then I recommend this bag to you. But if you are going to have this bag for liger than that go and look and th Essen concept bags on Amazon that are 60 dollars. I got one of the sixty dollar bags and the build quality is so much higher. After 4 months this bag started to fall apart. For example the handle ripped when I was picking the bag up. Just spend the extra money and you’ll be glad you did.
5,Used this with another carryon for a trip to Europe.  Loved the strap that held it to the handle of my roller bag.  Tons of space and pockets.  Love it!
3,This backpack does not stay on my shoulder as I had hoped. Tons of storage space but does not fit the bill for me. I constantly have to carry this pack in front of me because it keeps falling off my shoulder.  I'm going to order a different brand.
5,This pack back is great for traveling.  Lots of compartments and even charger for phone. Even distribution of items you would carry so you don't have that pull. Highly recommended.
5,Love this backpack
5,Very strong and durable material. Great for business travel.
5,This is a really good backpack. Great price and lots of packets highly recommended.
5,This bag is very well designed and extremely good quality. There is a secure section for a large laptop and ample spaces for power cords mouse and more. I love the useful built-in usb.
5,Es muy práctica y sirve para todo tipo de terreno
5,Great size condition and utility.
5,I have typically invested in a different brand name line of bags that have a lifetime guarantee but those bags are much thinner and less storage. These bags have so much room and are of a better quality. The shoulder straps are well padded and comfortable.  I’ve purchased one for my son and I and we both love them.
5,Perfect size to use for traveling. Was able to fit everything I needed and more. I highly recommend this
5,I like the deep pockets and lot of space.Good for traveling. I didn't like the locker that it brings its to thing and instruction not clear...i think for security you need a better security lock
5,I never saw this in person. I had it shipped directly to the project address. The goal was originally 500 book bags.  They were able to collect over 1000. There will be some happy children and teachers.
3,I love everything about this backpack except the adapter for the portable charges is already broken and all I did was attach my portable charger to it. It still charges it’s just has the wires exposed
4,I was a bit anxious about finding a new backpack and settled on this one because I thought it would be good for traveling. There are so many pockets! I thought I wouldn't like that there's two separate large pockets but it'll be nice to put my laptop in one pocket and clothes or textbooks in the other pocket. Plenty of other spaces to put cords snacks etc. including a pocket on the backside that you can put your phone/wallet/passport in when traveling. Mesh side pockets are bigger than photos make them look. Backpack is also fairly water resistant but it's probably not waterproof (not that the seller claims it is) so even though your items will be safe if a drink is spilled on the backpack I'm unsure how it'll hold up if walking in the rain. I'm glad I got this backpack the purple color is very cute and I'm excited to use it!
5,Very well made small backpack for small laptop and some things
4,Great bag
5,This was picked out by my 10 year old granddaughter.  She loves all the pockets.  All of her school stuff fits in there even her laptop.  Very good product for the price.
5,Has many compartments very spacious and durable. I have taken it with me for several trips and I absolutely love it. HIGHLY recommend.
5,This is my first week using this. The backpack is very VERY convenient and I carry a 16 inches macbook 12 inches tablet my music folder metal food container chargers powebank and etc.A lot of stuffs to be fit into this backpack and yet it feels super comfortable and light. When I carried my laptop before even without other extra stuffs I mentioned my backpacks felt too heavy. This one solved the problem. So far I believe it's durable. One quick cons that the bottle holder is a little short but not bad. The backpack gives you lots of different zippers and spaces. I love it.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Straps are a little short I use it for work
5,Love this back pack. More than your money's worth by far!!!
4,The only issue I’ve had is the durability of the thin black handle on the top.  I carry a lot of things in my bag every day and my bag continues to hold up without issues.
5,This is an all-around great backpack.  Everything is sturdy.  Multiple zippered pockets right where you want them.  As a nice bonus there is a little charger adapter that could let you connect a portable charger to a phone tucked in your pocket or in the outter backpack pocket.  I got this item on extreme discount sale not sure why but I'm extremely happy.  I've noticed that it is back in the $35-36 area.  At this price I would rate it 3-4 stars.  If you can catch this on sale for under $20.00 buy it immediately.  I'm very happy with my purchase but I don't think that it feels quite as sturdy as a $40.00 backpack that I purchased for camping needs.  Overall still a great backpack with no complaints.  =)
5,Love it so far haven't had a test on the water resistant's and still too new for durability also.
5,It’s nice and can fit a good amount of stuff. The charging being part of it is nice too.
5,Durable lots of pockets
5,I had to buy a new locks I wish that it came in black and steel gray otherwise so far it is a great bag. As long as it stays reasonably priced I will be buying more the college age kids in my family (8).
3,The size and weight of this backpack are great! Lots of compartments and easy to keep track of everything. It started coming apart after the first use though.
5,So far I've had it for a few weeks and no problems at all has a lot of rooms for different things to put inside.
4,The only thing I don’t enjoy about this bag is the weight. It already has some weight on its own and weighs even more when you finally add your stuff. Otherwise it’s very good quality and functional.
5,Love this bag. Nice and roomy perfect for travel and everyday life.  Stands up to water and it's very durable
3,I used this backpack for transporting my laptop some folders and usually 2-3 books along with a water bottle in the side pocket. It worked quite well for about 3 months but a tear developed in a bottom corner seam. Probably from book/laptop corners. The tear grew and a few weeks later I had to retire the backpack.Overall this is a good pack for light transport but if you anticipate regularly transporting more than a few books along with your laptop such as for university or college use then be careful.
5,Great for everything.
5,I leave for Portugal shortly so I’m getting this backpack ready. I unzip all the zippers and this bag goes on forever!  All the many places to put things is amazing and so well thought out. Even a phone charger cable attached inside that was a wonderful surprise! I know I’m going to love using it and can’t wait.
5,Just packing up loose items in your car
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I love how well put together it is looks very expensive yet affordable. Very durable i would recomend this especially for everyday use. I love it that you have an option to church your electronics but i havent tried yet. Im satisfied.
5,Big bag seems to he put together well. Havent tested the water resistance but overall happy with it.
3,I use my pack for work. Nice pack except for one of the zippers are very hard to move. As if it was grabbing material. I looked it over several times and nothing was in the way. It appears to be the metal zip itself.
5,Great backpack I bought one for myself a few years back and my son liked it so much he wanted one too. It has a lot of space inside plenty of padding for laptops/tablets and the built in port is really nice to have.BE AWARE: these do not come with a battery pack for charging but those are easy to find nowadays.I'm very happy with the quality of the bag and the material. It's held up through a lot. It isn't super water proof or anything but I've had to walk in the rain with it before and nothing got destroyed in it. It's definitely worth the buy.
2,I used this daily for work.  After 1.5 years the main zipper failed well half of it did.  It still works I just have to bring zipper to one side and not use the other.  For the price I guess I got my moneys worth but I will be investing in a better backpack for my next one.
5,I originally bought one but then my 10 year old "stole" it to use as his book bag so I had to buy another. It's durable and can hold a lot.
5,This backpack is very versatile! It has sooo many pockets to organize all my work stuff love that it has a usb and hidden pocket for my battery bank. It’s very lightweight so doesn’t add extra weight when carting. They straps are durable and comfortable.
4,This is an awesome product! I was very pleased with how much room it had! It holds all of my college notebooks plus my laptop plus a whole lot of little stuff here and there. Love all the pockets. It’s good quality and durable! One thing I really didn’t like was the price. It was a little more than I wanted to pay but it was worth it.
5,This is a very nice well-made backpack. It has a lot of room you can pack for a whole weekend in it and also put your computer in. I would highly recommend this if looking for a durable well-made roomy backpack.
5,Lots of space fir just about thing you could want or need day to day. Traveling it is great as a carryon; lightweight not to bulky. Overall absolutely worth every penny!
3,Bought this for a week in Disney and on Day 1 it ripped at a seam on one of the front pockets. I was able to use it for the remainder of my trip but was careful using that pocket so it didn’t rip more. (It gre a little as the trip went on). I’m hoping to find someone who can repair it because overall it worked great for what I needed & I would use it again for the same purpose.
5,Really like this backpacks size color compartments. We ordered it for this school year. Started using it mid August and it started to tear in October. Of course just out of return window. Idk if this just happened to be a defective one or not but disappointed. I did not rate it for water resistance as it’s not been wet. Nor for travel bc idk how well it would hold up.
5,I love all the compartments and extra packets
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I ordered this bag for girls in a Girl Scout Troop it is not even close to the size I thought it was after reading reviews and looking at pictures! People said that it held multiple thick college books and binders…In the main compartment I was able to fit a 3” binder 1” binder 2 folders 3 notebooks and 3 small books (small like a beginners chapter book) and it is stuffed and I’m worried about it being over loaded and possibly tearing at the seams like some other reviews. The shoulder straps are well padded. The back is well padded. It does fit my 14” computer in the back compartment. I’m going to try to put some writing supplies and a first aid bag in the front compartment. We will see how that works. As far as using instead of a suitcase to travel for a weekend… you better pack light! I don’t know if the reviews are listed under every size but this was a great disappointment as far as the 15.6” bag goes. Very VERY misleading!
3,I only used this bag once a week and after less than six months it tore right at a seam. It’s still functional as it tore open to padding not a compartment. The charging port works and I like the sub compartments in the bag. For the price I’m not mad. Still keeps my laptop safe.July 2022 Update: In addition to the large tare in the front compartment there is now a hole on the top near the handle and a hole in one of the inner mesh compartments.
5,Great backpack w- charging port
2,Bag already had two rips on the top. One by the handle and one at the front pocket section. I was really hoping it would last at least one school year.... maybe just half the year.. not two months.
5,It holds everything I need for work.
5,Lots of pockets space and dividers high quality backpack- especially for the price and the added in USB is very useful
4,God bag but thought it was bigger
5,The straps are comfortable on the shoulders. It holds many books and secures the laptop. I also like the smaller compartments for pens keys and smaller items.
5,Love it. Bought it for an airplane carry-on and it was perfect.
5,Love my new backpack!! ❤️❤️❤️
5,It is much better quality than purchasing something at your local store.
2,The charging port does not work and I don’t understand how it’s “removable” unless someone wants to explain a secret on charging the USB port and how to remove it for cleaning.  Other than that the backpack is nice.  I wish I would’ve tried the charging port as soon as I received the backpack because now it’s too late to return it.
5,Well made and reasonably priced. Plenty of compartments. Durable so far. I would buy again.
5,I use it for work business and just traveling around that holds a lot and it keeps everything very safe and protected
5,I needed this backpack as a carry on for a flight. It was able to fit my laptop and charger a book and various snacks and drinks. This backpack had lots of compartments and held together very well. I only used it for one trip but so far so good! Would definitely recommend for the price.
5,Lightweight but sturdy tons of storage space comfortable and the price is great!
2,Product is not durable. We used this one to two days a week for about three months and the seams ripped. Never had a problem with a backpack before ever. Cannot recommend.
5,El material y el espacio del maletín ne agradaro mucho
5,This backpack was amazing. It has so many pockets and it’s very spacious. It even came with a lock for the zipper just in case you want to keep it safe and closed. And you can connect your charger to it to charge your phone. It’s very comfortable for your back. And the price was amazing.
5,this is a great bookbag! not only does it have many compartments they are all pretty spacious.
3,Very stylish bag for half the cost of overpriced bags that are jacked up because the name . This bag has strong zippers and stitching. Many compartments for various this and thats. I was skep at first but now that it’s here I’m patting myself on the back for picking such an awesome bag !!
5,I use this backpack everyday to carry my essential items while walking to and from work. After a couple months of daily use it is still holding up well and I have no complaints. It has many pockets that I like to use to keep my items organized as well as a pocket designed especially for my laptop which is honestly the best backpack laptop compartment that I've had over the many years that I've carried backpacks for school and work.  It even has a little clip key ring attachment where I can easily attach/detach my keys so I don't lose them. As an added bonus the back side has nice cushioning which is comfortable on my back. Really good quality overall and I highly recommend.
2,Barely used and already coming apart. It is also NOT at all water resistant. The condensation from my water bottle got things inside all wet!!! I really deserve a refund but unfortunately that window is closed.
5,Great for shoulder free carry on.
5,Love the this product . Light weight. Many pockets. Well designed
5,Its not a top quality item.  But it does match what I paid for.  I did not test it but I bet it is not water proof.  I won't put my laptop in and go out in a raining day.I am not sure at this moment how durable it is.  The zippers do not appear to be heavy duty.  In general I think it is reasonably well made at this price point. It is roomy and quite comfortable to carry.  If you need higher quality and heavy duty ones consider to pay more.
5,I am in Radiology school and this is perfect for what I need. I have multiple courses and am in and out of buildings so if it is raining I don’t have to worry about it leaking through to my paperwork. Then the charging cable is nice if you have long days and need to charge your phone in between things.
5,I love this bookbag! It has a lot of space and really cool accessories.
5,This bag is a great size and holds everything I need!
3,I bought this backpack about a month ago and overall it has been fine but the lining in one of the compartments ripped after a month and I have yet to put anything in that pocket. It's also not quite as large as I like so I can't carry all of my textbooks in it at one time but that isn't the end of the world. I just switch them out depending on what classes I have that day. The laptop pouch in the back is very nice though and I was able to walk through a light rain without anything inside getting wet. I haven't used the charger port yet.
4,Used daily. Great backpack. Lots of storage and different pockets available.
5,My kids schools make the kids use laptops and if they’re not fully charged they get detention- the backpack saved many laptops from breaking
5,I had a last minute trip cross country and needed a backpack. I was able to fit 8 days worth of T-Shirts jeans underwear and socks in the bag. After stuffing it with that I still was able to fit my 13" laptop the charger my phone charger ear buds and toiletries.Let me mention it is just a normal size backpack but I was able to make my entire trip with the essentials in this one bag. So I was very pleased. I didn't get to test the water resistance much but it got rained on briefly and nothing inside got wet.
5,Everything it says it is and more! Completely Satisfied
5,The bag is good. I’ve been using it for school and it fits a lot of my things in it
5,The look is perfection and it works for everything
5,We bought it for vacation and it worked out great. Good value.
5,Perfect for nursing students. Highly recommend:)
5,It’s awesome that’s all I can say
5,By far best back pack that has satisfied my high school kid.
5,My grandsons favorite backpack  by far
3,It has a lot of pockets which I like. But the pockets don’t seem very deep or spacious. I am keeping it though because I’ve had some horrible backpacks as of recent and this one is better.
5,Great backpack! Tons of storage my laptop fits in it well. I am able to be organized because of all of the pockets. I don’t have to cram things into one area. It’s comfortable to wear the padding is nice and comfortable on the shoulders and back. I also love the compartment on the back to put things of value. It’s nice having a spot to clip my keys. Highly recommend! Worth every penny.
5,My daughter loves her back pack. Very roomy for all her school books and laptop.
5,This backpack has so much room! And to included a charging port ? Better yet! Obviously you have to connect a portable battery in order to use the port but it definitely comes in handy. On the inside of the back side ( the full black part) there's a hidden pocket where you can put passport walletetc and people won't be able to know it's there cause when you have it on your back is protecting the items.Quality seems good traveled twice with it and use it for work everyday and no damage. Color is amazing! Comfortable to boot! It's a great buy! And for the price? A steal!
5,I love this backpack so much! I'm not even kidding this bag has SO MANY POCKETS -- definitely AMAZING for the price! The charger area is clutter-free and I love how I can charge on the go. *Just be aware you need to have your own personal portable charger for this to work*. The material is really good quality and it seems waterproof! Overall the storage capacity is the best thing ever!! I will def use it for the next couple of years.
5,love it. wish i bought it sooner. wish i could also give more stars.
2,It’s a very nice backpack . After a month of use though the zippers have popped now I have to purchase a new backpack for my high schooler.
5,Just what I needed for my trip abroad
5,Amazing backpack I was surprised of the quality and aesthetic of such cheap bag that can used so roughly everyday. However it says it is water resistant it is not 100% but it does work against spilled water or light rain situation. I would highly recommend this bag to people who would like to use for everyday use and also it is really spacious despite I have put so many things inside the bag it does not feel heavy when I carry on my back.
5,Currently using to transport items to and from work everyday.  This backpack is very sturdy and still looks brand new after a month plus of everyday use.  Many compartments for organizing your stuff.  Really like this one.
5,I just finished the first month of college and this backpack hasn't disappointed me yet!The quality of the bag is amazing and it holds so much. The pockets are great too; everything always has a designated spot.Within this past week my area got a bunch of rain. Even though it was absolutely pouring everything in my bag stayed dry.I have nothing bad to say about this backpack :)
5,Good
2,I bought this a few months ago for school and it is already coming apart on the inside.
5,Si me agrado lo utilice para cargar tiqueta
5,Nice size and is very sturdy.
5,I think it can last long
5,Grandson uses for school.  It holds a lot and is not huge.  He really likes it and he can keep his phone charged!
5,My brother loved this gift!! It was exactly what he asked for for about half the price of stores!
2,I’m a nurse and I used this as my work backpack. I loved it til last week when the zipper randomly broke. I’ve only had the backpack for 6 months I’ve never had a zipper break so quickly. I didn’t over-stuff the backpack so I’m pretty disappointed.Before the zipper broke I loved it. It had the perfect amount of pockets to separate all my stuff and keep everything organized. But a broken zipper after only 6 months of use is a bummer.
5,I used this backpack for a 3 week grueling production that went on location. It was my lifeline. Places and pockets for all your paper packets folders laptop phone and charger snacks clothing if needed. Just a fabulous sidekick to store all your production needs! Durable and water resistant. Would buy again!
4,Using it as a diaper bag for my 2 kiddos. I like all the pockets so what I need is at hand. Though its a little cumbersome even without a lot in the bag. However it suits its purpose and I like it.
3,My daughter loves this bag because she can put her binders notebooks laptop and bottled water in it. She also likes the compartments.  She used it everyday. However after two months of everyday use the bottom is already ripped. Hoping to get a refund or exchange because the quality is unacceptable.UPDATE: October 2021Seller replaced item within a week of reporting damage. Kudos to the seller Seamong. We still love the bag because of the storage and organizational features but hopefully the quality is improved. Thanks.
5,This backpack is great! I like the multiple zippered sections and the front pocket is perfect for quick access to masks. Seemed to get a bit damp on the outside with rain but everything was good on the inside. The straps and back support are comfortable. Recommend!
3,
3,I was excited because this was perfect for my carry-on bag for a trip. Then on the way to the airport one of the zippers broke and now I have to travel with an open large front pocket wide open because there was no way for me to zip it up.
5,This is just the right size for all your travel item. It lite and comfortable and just the right size to fit under "the seat in front of you". Best backpack I've owned.
4,Back pack has many openings and is think enough I use it on my bike everywhere I go small but not too small wish it was alittle wider I couldn’t fit my laptop in it. But it’s prefect for a Ipad and school stuff and such
5,This is a great back pack for travel
5,Very big
2,My son used it for about 2 weeks than the strap broke.
5,I bought this bag to use as a laptop carrier for work and a book bag for school and it has served its purpose and worked flawlessly from the first day! I'm able to use the back-most pocket for my laptop and work notebooks the middle pocket for textbooks and binders and the final three exterior pockets for electronics snacks tampons phone chargers and whatever the hell else I decide I need to take to the office with me.Honestly sometimes there's almost too much room in this thing. 10/10 will 100% be buying again.
4,It's a good thing this is a. Backpack and therefore flexible because the package it came in was absolutely mangled. That being said the size was perfect for my uses. Very lightweight with plenty of storage space!
3,got a 17 inch lap top dosent fit
5,I carry lot of stuffs in my hand bags and it was usually uncomfortable and heavy because I put my laptop there plus I will still have to carry an extra carrier to house my things. I needed a backpack that could take all my stuffs. This backpack is reasonably priced and takes all my things. I was in the rain for some minutes on getting home I realized my backpack was not drenched. It was dry on the inside as well; all I did was use a cloth to clean the bag.
3,When I first received the bag I liked it. It had a nice look and multiple pockets inside like I need. The problem became 2 months in the material ripped away from the zipper on the middle compartment. I used it for a little while longer but it just looked bad. Luckily it wasn't too expensive.
3,I absolutely loved this backpack at first.  It was spacious and versatile.  I used it on 2 trips then I realized the zipper was not no longer working.  The quality of the bag is pretty decent but the zipper is terrible!
5,Excellent deal! Comfortable waterproof & it has more interior pockets than I have ever seen in a backpack. Pockets are important as I use it for travel to & fro work basically as a really big purse. The pockets make it easy to store the many many little items that I might need while at work - medical stuff charging cords boot chains emergency winter fleece (you just never know) over-the-ear headphones bottled water lunch wallet etc.. Unless I develope an allergy to it this is the best - for my purposes - I have ever seen or had!!!!
5,This things has pockets for days! Literally find new ones each day i was using it and iv used it for work school and travel. Good padding. Comfortable. And again all the pockets!
5,We bought this backpack for our kids who not only need to carry books but also iPads. This backpack is durable and can carry a lot.
5,Perfect! I bought this to replace a similar style I had that I also bought from a different company on Amazon. Love all the pockets love all the space. I also love the luggage strap on the back and the secret pocket on the back of the pack at the bottom I’m not using this backpack for laptop purposes but this would be great for your laptop needs. The shoulder straps are okay but if you’re intending to use this for heavy needs I might think about  more sturdy shoulder straps on another backpack.
5,I really love this backpack so far. It’s big enough and has enough pockets that I’ve been able to pack enough stuff in it to take on 3-4 day trips even with all my makeup and skincare stuff (and I have a lot)! It also feels way more high-end than the price would suggest. I definitely spent more on my old backpack and it was way flimsier made of thinner material and definitely not water resistant. The separate zippered laptop pocket is also really nice so I don’t need to use a bulky laptop sleeve.
4,This item was just a little smaller then I hoped it would be.
5,Es un morral agradable tiene estilo y es muy resistente todas las cosas dependen del trato que se le de. recomendado.
4,My daughter uses it for school. So far it looks great!
5,I am a home health nurse. I use this backpack to store all my supplies it. Very durable lots of storage pockets and large enough to fit all of my supplies. Makes it much more convenient to store my stuff to bring from visit to visit.
5,Se ajusta a la foto  medida ideal  el color hermoso  practica y liviana. Como bolso de mano es muy práctica
4,I liked mostly everything except its a little too big for my taste. I do like the design of the back pack and the compartments that it has in the back pack.
5,This backpack is very spacious and is very durable. I use it for school so the extra pockets are very neat. It fits my MacBook Air and there’s still room!!
5,It’s very comfortable and practical. I carry my laptop laptop charger power bank 3-5 containers of food and 2 mugs... and I’m 7 months pregnant and walk 2 miles wearing this backpack! Doesn’t hurt my shoulders at all. It distributes the weight eventually so I don’t even feel the heaviness of what’s inside of it! And I walked in heavy rain before wearing it and it didn’t leak rain water inside at all! Also there are plenty of space and pockets inside!I’m actually surprised how good it is for it’s price!
5,I love the backpack really nice but something got on it and it’s not coming off so the waterproof resistance on it isn’t good but I didn’t like through the bag so it’s OK what besides that it’s awesome and I love all the storage compartments.
5,Bag is falling apart at the seems. Not made well at all. Used it to care books and laptop.
4,Came in very quickly and it is a lot bigger than I thought it was which is perfect
3,Let me start of by saying my wife and I really like this bag however after a little over a month we realized bag started to rip we figured hey we like the bag let’s see if we can send it back in and get a replacement. However we were 3 days short of the return window. Hopefully the company will make an exception and reach out to us. Overall the bag is GREAT just not happy with the fact that is has torn some already after just a month.Please reach out to us in regards to a replacement
5,Replaced a “forever” bag that I just had to have @ 10x+ the price for ease of security screening. This bag hands down is better. Color was as shown layout for storage space is smart zippers are smooth and it holds a surprisingly high volume and weight. Stitching is solid! So if you carry lbs I doubt you’ll regret this option.When the forever/lifetime warranty bag comes back from the MFG repaired or replaced I highly doubt that I’ll switch back.
5,When it rained I got home I checked the backpack.  Bottom was damped. I Checked the Zipper and the were closed. So believe  the water ran down the bag and went in between the Zippers
5,Great value very happy with my purchase
3,The product is average in every category .. so if you are on a budget this is the product but if you have few dollars more i would recommend to upgrade
4,It’s good I guess just thought it was bigger
5,Works well
4,It’s not that water resistant. It’s really comfortable.
5,Very good quality bag. I use it for work and am able to fit my laptop mobile printer paper all the cords and many more things. It has multiple pockets to separate things. Definitely recommend!
5,Durable water resistant
5,Great travel bag. I don’t know if it’s water resistant but it must be since my daughter has been caught in several down pours and still loves her bag. I bought one for her and one for me. Very easy on back.
5,My sons love this bag! Easy to travel with super spacious and water resistant ASF! I want impressed when it arrived but this bag has REALLY been tested lol. It passed the vibe Check. I'll be ordering another.
5,I absolutely love this bag it has some many compartment and they’re all durable especially for the price. I’m a college student and it fits my textboo laptop notebook etc perfectly
5,My husband uses this for work stuff. He's a nurse so it's anything from a stethoscope to chargers meds clothes tablet etc. But we have also used it on vacation and are planning to use it on our flight coming up as his carry on. It's durable so far. It's large and has plenty of pockets and compartments for all your stuff. We are hoping it lasts.
4,Great laptop bag for the price good quality
5,Spacious comfortable and practical. Add your portable charger and charge your phone from outside your backpack.
5,Love love love traveling & this bag is perfect! It has enough pockets for what I need and very well padded. It does not hurt my back I’ll be adding a chest strap but other than that I get so many compliments on all that it hold. I prefer a designer stylish bag but for all that I hold & as much as I travel this bag holds it all. You will not regret it
5,I have been using this bag pack for quite some time now. I love it. It fits everything that I need in it and it can carry alooot
5,I will be using for work and when I go on hikes. Fits under an airplane seat as well.
5,Are use this as my carry-on when I went to Florida. It was perfect
5,I needed a new back pack for work and one that was inexpensive but still dependable. This is great! It looks small but it has quite a bit of room. To give a size description it holds my clipboard couple small books all my "nursing stuff" (stethoscope scissors tape goggles etc.). I love how it has a pocket near the bottom of the shoulder strap area because it's a quick and easy way to store my keys and badge instead of trying to search in every pocket.Highly recommend!
5,I've carried my bag with me every day for 4 months. Still no rips or tares. The only thing is my external charge port didn't work from day 1. I've brought it on my kayak and only got a little water seepage...
2,I have been extremely careful with this bag and the section that has pockets and holds pencils. Two of the pockets ripped.  It happened too late for me to return it. So I will make do for now.
5,Good product . Better than expected.
5,there are so many pockets and space for all my things in this backpack. i could easily find a place for nearly everything i put in there. i was unsure if everything would fit nicely in this backpack but surprisingly it all fit and there was still more room. it’s also really comfortable to carry and wear and because of that it’s amazing for traveling.
5,This is a good backpack This has enough space and is very comfortable
4,Don't get me wrong it's a great bag. Tons of pockets a key ring/clasp the outlet pocket. But try not to add too many things to the bag or else you're gonna probably break your back. The bag itself is pretty heavy compared to other bags but that just means it's durable.
5,I use it for work. It has lots of different pockets for smaller stuff and it’s roomy for larger larger items. Haven’t needed to try out the USB connector for charging my items but it’s very convenient. Very good deal for the price.
4,Using for work just a little too bulky.  I received item fast and in great shape.
5,Very sturdy! I carried my MA books (4) & laptop as well.
4,Liked it initially. Top handle came off within a month. The rest has held up pretty well.
5,I am a travel nurse and specifically got this bag for nursing. Take to work etc. it’s great quality. Thick and durable. Has many many pockets and holders inside. I would buy another one when needed or just to have another for my other needs. Highly recommend so far
5,I got caught riding my bike in the rain with this on and hap my laptop power bank EarPods all in the backpack. The outside of the bag was soaked but everything inside was as dry as when I put it in. You can fit a lot of stuff inside (more than you would think from looking at it anyway).
5,tomo me cabe y es muy practica
2,It's an ok back pack but it came really dirty. I had to wipe it with a hot rag and dish soap
5,This backpack is exactly what I needed. I work full time and do online classes so I took my laptop and books everywhere I go and this has been perfect. It has lots of pockets and places to hold everything I have and not bend or wrinkle my papers. I even was wearing it as I walked in the rain to work and not a single drop got inside at all!!!
5,My son picked this backpack out for starting middle school! He absolutely loves it! It is a great size and fits a lot of stuff in it and it is still pretty light! I am impressed.
5,This $10.00 backpack was much nicer than I expected. I want it to use as a carry-on for travel. The strap across the back slides easily over the extendable handle on wheeled suitcases and the back look pretty sturdy. For the occasional travel bag it will do very nicely.
5,I love this backpack! I am a full time medical student working on my doctorate and it fits everything I need it to (including binders books laptop and more). It’s cute and fashionable but not over the top so I can take it anywhere. I’d recommend this to any busy person or student!
5,I love this bag I can put all most everything in it lol
5,Su capacidad y funcionalidad
5,I use it as a gym bag . It has lots of comfortable space & compartments and just right for what I need .
5,Great
3,It’s nice if you’re only going to have a couple things in it. I have a macbook and ipad I put in it and they’re apparently too heavy the strap adjusters don’t stay in place. It’s also very uncomfortable:(
5,The middle zipper broke off the backpack we ordered so I contacted their customer service and they were very friendly and quickly sent me a new backpack. The backpack itself is very sturdy and nice! Definitely recommend.
5,Roomy and sturdy. Looked well made. It was donated to a local charity which provides filled knapsack to kids going back to school. It was perfect for a high school  or college student.
5,My daughter uses this for school. She loves this backpack says it is the best one she has had so far.
5,Really love this backpack just wish my dog didn't chew off the tightening straps urg!! Other than that super durable and amazing for travel as a personal item bag.
5,This is a really good book bag with a lot of compartments and a lot of room.
5,I love the key attachment! I’m using this as a diaper bag for my one year old. So far it meets our needs perfectly!
1,Kinda cheeper material. But we usually go with swiss. Daughter used last pack for 3 years. Got this one cause she really wanted purple and I was cool with it cause I didn't have to scotch guard it.  But 2nd day of school zipper failed and it's broken and cause I shopped early I guess I can not return it or have anything fixed. Got through half of second day of middle school.  And I don't know if it is waterproof or not. It didn't rain on the one full day it was functional.
3,I love everything about this backpack except the durability. I hold a normal amount of things in this that does not exceed an unrealistic weight but the strap is holding on by a thread. Super sad
5,Es de material  grueso  tiene muchos compartimentos Ami hijo le encantó
4,Good backpack lots of room and pockets to hold everything I need. The only complaint I have was delivery it said next day but took 2 days to arrive so it's not an awful thing just an inconvenience
5,My son picked this backpack out for high school. It's very sturdy the color is vibrant it has plenty of room and is waterproof. I would highly recommend this backpack. It's also very affordable.
5,I am very pleasantly surprised at how well put together this backpack is.  Every compartment is well padded.  I was able to put two laptops in the bag one 14" and one 15.6" and still plenty of room left for the other items.  Plenty of pockets and dividers.  I am very impressed with the bag at the price offered.  Not at all cheaply made.
5,I got it for my son to carry at an amusement park and now he uses it for school. He really likes the cell phone port charge.
5,So many pockets! Perfect for your laptop (big screen) cords adapters tablet audio/mic camcorder cameras and lenses. I had room for small ring light and my tripod too. All padded and even a pocket for your water bottle! I was able to ditch my extra bag!
4,Best purchase ever. Great for school traveling and hiking
5,I use this for work. It is super sturdy and the straps are very comfortable. It can hold a lot of weight and items. I love the different pockets and security pocket on the back very discreet. It also has two compartments on each side for bottles. I've put in rather large water bottles and it holds great.
5,This is a great backpack...especially love the charger option.
2,Loved the backpack at first. It was a little lower quality than the Amazon recommended one but had purple. My daughter used it for school.Less than 2 months of school use (no heavy item) the zipper on the front pocket broke in two. I don’t have a pic of the piece but you can see no remnant of the zipper piece remains.
5,I love this backpack.  I use it to carry my things I take to dialysis.  The center gave me a tote bag and it was SO heavy and clumsy and weighed a TON.  This back pack holds EVERYTHING I put in that tote and is very lightweight to carry.  I have a blanket a neck pillow tablet phone wallet and meds in it!  And I still have some room.
5,Very good laptop backpack. Very well made durable fabric lots of pockets. The charging port is a nice feature. I plug my external battery inside and hook my phone up outside and I don't need to fumble around unzipping pockets looking for my charger in an airport.  Easily holds s significant amount of weight and the straps sre nicely padded. Would highly recommend.
5,It’s my daughters first year of high school and this bag made getting her to school and along with her computer a breeze.
5,I'm in school for massage therapy and this bag holds all of my books and everything I need for class. At least 25 pounds worth of books at least. It's very sturdy. I'm very happy with it.
5,This is the best backpack I have ever had. I’m in nursing school and it literally holds everything!
5,I used this backpack for traveling. It fits nicely under airplane seat. Lots of pockets. It's comfortable to carry and the security pocket on the back is a nice addition. The cushioning is great for protecting your stuff but limits space. Overall a good value for the price.
3,Didn't like the product
5,Great quality. Love it
5,I was hoping this bag would last a year but has only managed almost 7 months. The handle stitching has come undone and the zippers keep sticking. I am sorry to say I no longer recommend this bag.
5,Exelente calidad
5,I use this backpack daily for my job. I can pack Eve thing I need and a second uniform just in case. There are plenty of pockets that are able to keep things organized. I love the key clip because I lose my work keys at home at least once a week. I haven’t tested the water resistance out yet.
3,Bag had all the features and was cool enough for a high school student to select and tote to school. Unfortunately the zippers in one of the central areas didn’t last a week of school. Disappointed yes. The return process was easy with Amazon.
5,This backpack was a good value for the price.  It was large enough for a high school backpack.  It was well constructed although the top of the shoulder straps seemed less secure than I would prefer.
3,Need an exchange on grey backback front of it the stiching has come a loose. Need a replacement and change the color of the back pack
5,Bought This For A Friend And She Loves It. Great Product & Service. Thank You! :)
2,I bought this for my teenage son. The inside zipper for the USB port charging pocket was broken on arrival.  After 2 weeks of use the inside padded area for the laptop started to separate.  This is week 6 and I'm tired of sewing different parts back together.  I already purchased another backpack for him to finish the school year.  It would probably be okay for younger kids but not tough enough for teens.
2,I loved it at first but I noticed there is seams busting and I've barely used the backpack
5,SO MANY COMPARTMENTS! It was giant and had so many storage areas I really recommend for school traveling and really anything else PLEASE BUY!
5,This backpack has a ton of pockets and a place for laptop. I could not be happier. Plus not very heavy without anything in it. I leave for a trip tomorrow and can't wait to use it. The only thing I would suggest is a clear window to put an address in case.
5,Con mucho espacio bolsillos y es cómoda para usar aun incluyendo mi laptop que es algo pesada se me es cómoda andar con ella.
5,Honestly for the price i would honestly give  more than 5 🌟 ⭐️ 🌟 ⭐️ 🌟 ⭐️ it is more than i was expecting; my girls liked it too especially for high school but they were looking for more of a girlie colors 😔 but overall this backpack 🎒 is AMAZING 🤩
5,Doesn’t stand up on its own. Keeps falling over. Otherwise ok.
5,Pretty happy with all the perks of the backpack. The only small issue is that the middle compartment is not wide enough sometimes. But it's worth it
5,My sophomore is really liking this bag. It expands to fit all her school books and even is wired for a backup battery.
5,I am using it for college and it is great for everything like laptop books phone water etc pretty much anything will fit!
5,I use this to travel for work. Worth every penny
2,I like this bag but I would say the adjustable shoulder straps can use some work in terms of ease of adjusting. It’s not as simple of a simple pull of the straps. I would also say that while the color selection is nice it could be a bit more expansive. The color choices seemed a bit limited in my opinion
5,I bought this backpack after ordering a different one that I did not really like. I really like the way this one is built. It is made well and very functional for what I wanted. Nice and sleek looking too. Feels and looks sturdy enough to last a long time.
3,I absolutely loved this product until about a month later when it ripped a big hole along the seam of the zipper.
5,I used this bag while traveling and hiking over a month. It's very durable and useful and I would recommend it.
5,I got this for travel. Works perfectly! Was able to slide over my pull behind for easier use in airport. Straps for backpack were comfortable. Would recommend!
5,BOUGHT ONE FOR MY 13 YEAR OLD THEN HAD TO BUY ANOTHER FOR MY 10 YEAR BECAUSE HE LIKED IT SO MUCH. REALLY GOOD QUALITY THEY HAVE A HAD THEM A FEW MONTHS NOW AND THEY ARE HOLDING UP NICELY. GOOD BUY.
5,This backpack is amazing! I need one for work because I need to keep a change of clothes and some other things with me and it is perfect.  The spot for the cord is hidden from rain while being fully functional. I'd recommend this to anyone!
5,Fits all I need. Good material.
5,Love this! I'm in college right now and my laptop is old and big 17.5 inches and it fits! Straps are comfortable love all of the pocket organization.
5,Perfect backpack! Great quality lots of space yet not too big perfect for travel. Go for it you will not regret it!
1,For what i paid for this backpack i expected it to last longer than 1 month. Adjustable clip broke and and one of the straps is completely ripping off. Not durable or safe.
3,great product not very durable though
2,I traveled to France and the bag was confortable to carry and walk around (airport trail city beach) it has a lot of compartments and a space.But … a thunderstorm hit us for 10 min on the trail and even though we found shelter in the forest ALL the compartments got soaked inside along with everything it (dripping) and if it wasn’t for the book that was in it then wallets passports and train tickets (which I put in the computer compartment) would have been ruined — they were damp but not damaged.The book took most of the hit and fell apart (bye bye Andre Agassi autobiography) I am disappointed because I bought the bag loving that it was also water resistant.Don’t put your computer in there if there is a chance of rain
5,This backpack is perfect - I use it for work laptop fits in it perfectly lots of space for other things and super comfy to wear
1,Purchased this to use as a carryon for a cruise. The night before the trip I found the inside top of the main compartment was tearing. Very poor quality product. Will not recommend to anyone.
4,Bigger thank I thought it was going to be. But great storage holds all my tech well and is sturdy.
3,Nice looking.  But material of construction is cheap. Bottom seams tore out after a week
3,I bought this for my daughter to use for school. She was so excited to use it but on the first day the zipper broke!
5,I love this bag I use it for my work laptop and supplies and it’s lightweight and durable. Suffice room and great style and color. Pricing was amazing for what I got it for. Get complements all the time.
5,The backpack is great except the USB port doesn’t work for him but not a big deal
5,I use this daily and love it. I can keep everything organized so much easier. I love all of the zipper compartments without all of the bulkiness that I have had in the past. Great quality for a great price.
5,Amazing! Comfortable and has so many pockets! It is totally waterproof too! I was caught in the rain and my laptop and papers stayed dry!
3,just poured a little water on it and it felt a little wet inside the small pocket looks and feels good tho other then that
2,Disappointed I brought 2 for my teenagers and the charger don’t work
5,Love this book bag has held up to my college needs!! I can put a lot of stuff in there and haven’t had an issue!! It’s light weight and comfortable to wear... I got to my boyfriends a lot and this comes with me everytime...
5,Bought this as I’m going back for my masters so I wanted a durable bag to carry my lap top and kindle in.  Lots of pockets and compartments to keep things safe.
4,Perfect backpack for bringing work files and laptop back and forth between home office and work.
3,It is durable enough but as for protection for laptops it is a 2star at best it's padded on your back but at the bottom and corners nothing. Not enough for a laptop tablet maybe. Don't know about the water resistance yet.
5,Perfect bag alot of room
5,I love this backpack. My laptop and school work fits in the back sleeve perfectly! While allowing me to put my lunch and water in the big pocket. I love the small pockets for pens and highlighters!
5,Granddaughter loves this bookbag.  Large enough for a 10th grader.  Very durable.
3,too thin to hold anything but a computer and/tablet. no room for anything bulkier in the center section so worthless to me for traveling.
5,I’ve used it once as my personal item on a flight. It has lots of space pockets to keep everything organized and is comfortable to carry. It looks sturdy and should last a good while.
5,Not what i expected. Its better. My daughter is in love with it.
1,Used it two or three times and it’s already falling apart. Seams falling  apart material on straps are falling apart. Not worth the buy. Invest in something else
1,I was really disappointed with this purchasethe bag didn't even last 1 month. Rips and tears along the threaded parts then the zipper broke today that was my last straw after deciding to sew rips. So it was a waste of money n time investing in reviewing this product before I purchased
5,Amazing backpack (I’m super picky lol) this backpack is a good size and has lots of pockets!! Excited to use it (:
5,I am very pleased with my purchase. This backpack is very comfortable and can hold a lot. I am a college student and I’m able to fit my laptop notebook my canteen and a few other items inside with no issues. Highly recommend.
5,Feels great
5,Use it daily and it has lots of room several pockets and good quality.
5,Great Bookbag for everyday use.
1,The middle of the backpack tore on the 2nd day of usage. I bought it to use during the rainy season in Guatemala. It did work well on the water resistance part. I also loved the color and style. But was very upset when it tore so easily. Going to try and return but got back from Guatemala one day after the return period. Do not waste your money. Especially if you need it on a long trip like I did.
5,This is perfect for a nursimg student! I have so many books to carry out through they day plus my laptop. And it fits all in my bag!! I dont even need to carry my water bottles.
5,La mochila es bastante espaciosa muchos compartimentos internos justo lo que buscaba. Mas adelante actualizare mi review sobre durabilidad y resistencia al agua.
4,good quality but charge port don't work
2,There's a lock that comes with the bag trying to change the combo the lock broke.
5,Feels great when it’s on my back love all the extra compartments and separate lap top section!I’m in nursing school so it fits all of my supplies & binders and has a durable material... very happy with this purchase!
5,Light weight. Have not taken a trip as yet but I love the pockets and there is a charging port pocket with adapter did not even see that one.
5,I like this product because it's durable and it's easy to clean
5,Got this for a new diaper bag and it was a great choice thus far. Durable spacious and comfortable. If it can survive two toddler boys it can survive anything.
5,I love this backpack. I was able to fit my HP Notebook PC in it. I love the extra compartments in it as well. I can fit all of my school stuff and computer in one bag.
5,It's comfyholds my laptop with plenty of room for gym clothes or my lunch.
5,Bought initially as a laptop bag but I used it as my travel bag for short trips and the usb cord for the power source is really good for backup power.
5,Muy lindo producto y comodo
3,Used it for my recent trip. Was disappointed that my laptop wouldn't fit in the padded pocket but did fit in the zippered section.
1,I bought this bag ahead of time to surprise my daughter on her birthday. She started using it in January 2022. In less than 6 months of gentle use the center ZIP BROKE My daughter takes care of her belongings very well and the bag was in excellent condition. This bag looked very strong but I am highly disappointed. I wish the seller may refund me my money and I can send them the bag back or send me a new bag hopefully with better quality of zips.
5,Perfect size and sturdy. Can hold anything you need and a lap top. Loves it has a spot for a battery pack easy way to charge your devices.
5,It does the job. Roomy compartments nice padding for protection. I use it everyday. Highly recommend this one!
1,I loved it it was great for school but only 4 weeks in and I am searching for something that will not fall apart
5,Lo que no me gustó es que no todos los cierres tienen para cerrar de ambos lados
5,The bookbag was perfecr for my daughter she is a 8th grader with alot of books and laptop to work from. So far the bookbag is holding up well and the kids can charge their phone from it.
4,i liked how its easy to use
5,Ordered this bag not expecting much but over all I love this bag its very comfortable it doesn't hurt the shoulders like some do and I can fit alot of stuff in there
5,Quality is great tons of room for everything little pockets for everything your keys Sports bottle for water. Plenty of room for a laptop.Buy with confidence you will not be disappointed.
5,So many pockets so much room! I was impressed with all it holds. Very durable & stylish. I purchased to use as my personal item for flying and it worked great!
5,Great product very roomy and durable!
5,I use this backpack for work. I love the secret pocket. It's big enough to fit a large wallet and a few other things.. overall we made.
1,Only had it a little over a month and it’s fell apart and can’t even be used
1,Bag ripped all down the back after a month and half of use bag is now unable to be used and a waste of money
4,Good backpack for the price. My laptop is secure and it's comfortable to wear.
5,granddaughter please with new school bag.
4,Perfect size. Lots of pockets.
1,Neutral color. Good size. Durability terrible!Bought for my daughter in high school. We bough this a couple months before school ended in May because her old backpack she'd had for years finally wore out. This backpack lasted 3 weeks before the strap ripped. She held it together with duct tape to finish out the school year.
5,This is the best backpack I have ever owned.  So handy to be able to charge my cell phone.  It is water resistant.  The campartments are well designed for easy retrieval of items.
5,I bought this bag as a work bag since I’m floating between 3 offices. I love it. It carries everything I need and sits on my back perfectly.
5,This has way more room than expected. Very sturdy as well. All materials seem to be top notch and heavy duty.
2,Backpack held up for one month under light use.  Carried google chromebook plus 2 textbooks daily to and from school.  Cute backpack and sizeable but couldn’t handle daily use.  Only lasted one month before the bottom seam ripped.  Next time going with a more reputable Swiss gear for the same price or cheaper on sale.
5,My son is using this backpack for school it is durable and comfortable for taking back n forth daily.
5,My daughter uses this as an every day back pack for school and she loves it. It is made very well and has many many pockets.
5,So many pockets and compartments. This backpack is well made and big enough for an adult. It would probably be too big for a child.
5,I use this in college to hold my laptop and supplies . Has many pockets and is way more than I thought it was in the description. It’s super durable
5,Loved using this while traveling by airplane. It fit perfectly under the seat & was comfortable while carrying with a laptop and other things inside.
5,Perfect size. Durable holds its shape. Very satisfied with this backpack.
4,The USB port does not work
1,This made first day of school an adventure in finding a new backpack. Don’t buy it unless you like this kind of adventure.
5,I have high school aged kids. They needed something sturdy and that would fit their school laptop. This bag is roomy and made well.
5,Fits a 15 inch laptop perfectly. Holds it nice and snug. So many other pockets for everything you can think of. Great backpack A+++
5,Awesome quality backpack. Use it every day for work.
4,Nice back pack
5,Good backpack for the price
5,The backpack overall has a lot of storage. I can fit my lab top a couple books and notebooks plus a charger and other small things
5,Great for traveling and very spacious.
5,I was skeptical at first but I ended up getting g it based on reviews and I’m actually glad I did get the bag
5,I use this bag for work and the hospital and it is amazing.  I still have room to feel.
2,The overall quality of the backpack is okay but when the backpack arrived both of the USB charging ports were bent and broken. Poorly made and cheap material as far as the charger so if this is something that you were looking for don’t go try to go for a cheaper option like this product.
5,I liked everything. There was not a thing I did not like.
5,This bag is awesome  it carried more than expected. It's great for travelling the sturdy straps and handle made it comfortable and easy to carry.
1,I travel for a living and was looking for a new weatherproof backpack that I could attach to my roller bag. I cringe every time I have to use the baggage strap because it's so thin that I end up pinching my fingers every time I use it. The seams are already starting to pop and the inside vinyl is so cheap that it's worthless to try to keep anything in the pockets.I'm glad it was inexpensive because I'm back on the hunt for a new backpack.
5,Absolutely love love love this bag for my everyday essentials fees good to be able to carry my laptop and everything that I need ❤️
5,Traveled 1220 miles with it and my expensive laptop is in perfect condition as are my external hard drives. 👍🏼
3,I bought this for my 11 year old to take to school but it’s way too small and I had to return. This would be great for traveling as a carry on bag or an overnight back for kids. Seemed durable though and had lots of compartments.
5,so i re gifted it was priced reasonably to where i could order a new one
5,Bought it for work and absolutely love it. It’s become my everyday bag for running errands and other things too.
5,This backpack has been wonderful so far. I use it as my college backpack & it’s great!!
2,After a month of use the straps are coming off.  Disappointed
5,Comfortable also got a lot of section separation and a USB charging cable build-in inside of it which is really nice
5,Nice structured backpack. Fits my needs for both college and working at a hospital. Really is water resistant as well!
5,So far so good! I need a backpack that I can wipe down between home visits and I think this will hold up well. It has many compartments to keep organized!
2,It’s not a charger for phones it’s got a lightning strike and not usb
5,Es muy espacioso muy cómodo
5,Very durable and has a ton of space. I love how it has organized pockets.
5,Very pleased very roomy and nice
5,Such a great bag. It's light weight and has many pockets and pouches within the pockets. Seriosuly love how much I could fit I there.
5,Good quality. Several separate areas for storage. Safe padded pocket for laptop.
5,Great for traveling
5,Love this backpack. Only had it for a week but it is very sturdy and holds my laptop and files. Haven't tested it for water resistance yet.
2,Its definitely not waterproof. It soaked up all the water I sprayed  on it.
2,The compartments are great but zippers and tags are falling off after a week of use.
5,This is so worth every penny.  Love all the pockets the appearance  the extras. Would definitely recommend.
2,Liked the style and fabric. Good compartments. However the padded shoulder straps are very uncomfortable  especially when the bag is full.  The padding doesn't go down far enough so the straps end up digging into your underarms. The ends of the straps do not have a stopper so they frequently pull all the way through the buckle.
5,It was roomy held all xtra stuff
5,For the price - this is a must buy. Stylish and plenty of compartments. Exactly what I needed.
5,I got it for my husband and he can’t stop raving about it. It’s exactly as described. Thanks
5,This is an awesome buy for the price! I’ve only had it a week but I love it so far!
5,Sturdy and fits a lot of books plus the laptop.
3,Zipper broke after 3 months- my daughter have a lot of school books she carries and it didn’t hold up.
5,Gift for my son and he said it was perfect for everything and the charging port in it worked perfect.. Highly recommend.
4,Roomy bag with many spaces
2,The backpack wears well and looks nice but started falling apart less than a month after purchase. Now towards the end of the term the main handle is hanging by a thread and a couple of the pocket corners are coming loose. Not built to last unfortunately.
5,Perfect for air travel. Compact look and design. Yet holds SO much! Comfortable straps. Fits perfectly under airplane seats
5,Love this bag. It’s perfect to take my work stuff to and from the office.
5,Lots of compartments fits my tablet and stuff easily and very nicely padded.Great product.
5,Sturdy with a lot of useful compartments.
2,Bought this backpack for my senior in high school.  When it arrived we loved the color and the style.  After about six weeks of school it ripped and was useless.  Too late to return.  Very disappointed.  I would not recommend it for students who are going to be carrying much weight in their backpacks.
5,Great backpack especially for the money.
5,Lots of pockets
5,This is a very high quality backpack. My daughter is very pleased with it. Much better than the options I found in the store.

5,Really  quality material for the price and fast shipping as well. I am planning on using for college
5,I love it!
1,The zipper broke within two weeks.
2,This was an amazing backpack. It was perfect for work because it was big enough to hold everything I needed it to (laptop files planner food water and such). However It dropped out of my car and the zipper split. There's no fixing this. I had it for three months.
5,Very good and super useful for all my computers and class work
5,Today it was pouring rain and I was impressed with how dry the inside of my bag was.Holds everything I need and stays organized. Excellent bag!
5,This was even better than expected great amount of compacts. The right size too!
5,Great sturdy backpack!! Good size... not too small and not too big!! Lots of pockets!!
5,Great quality
3,Cute and does what it is supposed to. Arrived with a stain on the side which is a little disappointing but it works.

5,Very durable full of space and my new fav backpack!
5,Love this bag. First off it stylish lots of space and pockets. Awesome
5,The backpack fits laptop and folder and is durable
5,Perfect for school! MORE than enough room for laptop books pen bag etc.
5,Has lots of pockets! Great material. The back has padding and the straps are comfortable.
5,Middle schooler loves this for bringing his computer to and from school.
1,Bought this for my son for school. Two of the zippers are already broken after 4 weeks of use. One is the big pouch it’s unusable now.
5,Amazing bag... Fits everything i need it to... Both laptops and all
5,Awesome backpack with plenty of storage!
5,I purchased as a teacher bag . a bit small for my needs. Thought would have more capacity.
5,Very spacious...has all my technology gadgets in there. Now I know where everything is.
5,Great quality plenty of pockets and storage space and the overall weight even fully loaded is pretty good
5,Nothing
2,This had a terrible smell that would not dissipate. Had to buy something else.
5,Great backpack. A lot of storage.
5,I really like this bag. I’m going out of town next week and excited to use it!
2,Strap tore after minimal use
5,Wife loves it say it's comfortable that it is padded.
1,Decent backpack but has no durability. The backpack seams ripped immediately when I went to go travel for a week. I had the backpack for less than 2 days at this point. I couldn't return it because I wasn't able to get it to a return station in time. Not worth your money.
5,Great bag! Love it! Worth every penny
5,Love the size and very durable. Comfortable on the shoulders and back
5,Love it! Great all around backpack.
2,Terrible product it lasted for 5 months
5,I use it for school and traveling  and love it.
5,Nicely made backpack holds a lot
5,I’m loving on how many things I can carry with it
5,Very happy with product great delivery time
1,I ended up having to toss this backpack pretty quickly. Incredibly disappointed. The first zipper on the middle pocket (it has two zippers) suddenly went off tracks. Not a big deal. Not even three days later my other one went off tracks and couldn't get it back on or even try to recover the zipper. It's because the train was faulty for the zipper line and quite frankly garbage. I've had cheaper backpacks from Walmart last me ten times longer than this one did. I bought the back pack June 13th 2021. It went out this morning on my way into work (September 28th 2021).To say I'm never buying this brand again is quite the understatement. I'm going back to Walmart again for backpacks. SMH
5,Perfect for travel.
5,amazing for school especially during these times with the laptop pocket
1,Stitching was left undone and falling off on the 2nd day of school.
5,wife loves the look and does what she wanted it for
5,Solid backpack just wish the straps had more cushion. Tends to dig in when filled.
5,It’s great for traveling. It’s water resistant. It is comfortable.
5,This is a perfect size for youth.
5,School
5,Very spacious and comfortable. Haven’t checked if it’s water resistant yet.
1,Bought this backpack for our 6th grader he wanted solid black and needed one with multiple compartments for his laptop school binder and athletic clothes…. He doesn’t carry any books in it as our district has all books on their laptops.  But the zipper broke after 3 months of having it!  Ordered in Oct 29th no school for 2 weeks in Dec and it’s broke on Jan 30th… His other backpacks from Sam’s have always lasted the whole school year and some!
2,The backpack is smaller than shown on the page. It can’t store all of the items that I need it to carry
5,Well made. Good zippers. Definitely great value for money.
5,Adecuada para laptop de 17"
5,A really good bag.
1,Had this bag was great until strap broke after less than 90 days no returnsWaste of money looks nice but poor quality
5,Absolutely love it. Great material
5,Well made & durable.  Love it!
2,Boughtt for My High Schooler. He came home a couple weeks ago and said he needs a new back pack. The whole corner of this one came apart! Tore open!
2,Got this for my daughter who is in middle school to use. She was able to use it for less than a month when the seams that secure the shoulder straps to the backpack started coming apart.
2,To small
5,I’m happy with this bag .
5,I like that it had the multiple pockets
1,I really wish this bag had worked out. It had so many features I was looking for. Unfortunately the first bag I received had a defective charging port. I received a replacement backpack only to have one of the zippers incorrectly attached to the bag. I contacted Amazon and didn’t receive much assistance for a replacement. Disappointed. Look elsewhere if you want a backpack that will last you more than a week. :-/
2,My youngest (14) uses this as his backpack for school. He has has it 6 weeks and it's literally falling apart. The handle is coming off and the side seam is ripped out. Very VERY disappointed.
5,Daughter loves it
2,Within one month of incredibly light usage one of the seams came undone leaving the backpack useless.  So very disappointed 😕
2,My daughter in 5th grade used this for one month and it already ripped down the side.  For the price I would expect much higher quality and durability.  Would not recommend.
2,It’s much smaller space wise than you would think.  It has a lot of pockets but the internal sections are very padded oddly so that there is not enough space for my kids to carry their things for school. I will need to re-order something else.
5,Does it's job. Quality.
2,I used this backpack for school. When I first got it I thought it was comfy and spacious. But it broke within one month of use. I'd love to return the item and get a refund but I can't :(
5,Perfect laptop backpack for durability.
5,Love it!
5,Nice lots of space and pockets
1,The zippers broke off within 6 weeks and I wasn't even carrying my lap top in it yet. What a waste of money.
1,This is the second one of these backpacks I have ordered. First one inside liner ripped right away. Luckily it was within the window to get a replacement. Now they current ones straps are ripping off. We are outside the window of return but this product is not made to last. Falls apart easily.
5,Love this bag my 2nd one
1,The bag is a great size with lots of pockets.  Would have been a great find but it ripped inside within 30 minutes of traveling.  Not well made.  Very disappointed in the quality.  Buyer beware!  Lots of reviews seem to say the same thing about the quality.
2,Very disappointed with this product. I purchased it for my 7th grader for school and it’s already splitting at the seam after only a month and we are past the return window at the point.
1,The price very expensive for this bag pack…….
5,Perfect for travel confortable and convenient
5,Perfect for nursing school!
5,Love everything about this backpack
5,Love this bag !
5,Love it!! Lots of space!!!
2,Product arrived quickly via prime for my Junior high student. However within 2 months it tore. Unfortunate that a book bag can’t handle a couple books and papers.
1,Our 8th grader has only used this since school started in August. So it’s been 2 and a half months and the side of it completely ripped open creating a large hole about 8 inches long. TWO AND A HALF MONTHS!!! And of course it’s past the date to return it. This is absolutely ridiculous. It opened all the way down the seam. It wasn’t from any thing he did as well it’s just absolutely a horrible quality backpack and do not waste your money. Now we have to get him a new backpack because y’all’s sucks. This is ridiculous. Extremely disappointed.
2,Seemed like it would last but the seams are coming apart 3 months into the school year.
5,very good
5,I love it!
5,Love it for school
5,Nothing
5,Nice! Spacious
5,Loved it
5,This backpack is perfect for my travels.
5,I like everything
1,I had the bag on my back with my laptop inside and the zipper let go and the computer was close to falling out. There are times i will zip it up and pick the bag up and it will immediately open other than that it is an okay bag but wouldnt recommend this to anyone that is carrying a computer around.
1,When I got the bag I put it to the test if it is water proof or not. I put paper inside all the bag parts. And turned on my shower to test if my items would be safe if it started raining. The paper got wet I only left it under the shower for like  barely 10 and water started to also accumulate on the bottom of the bag. I think water can leak through the zipper or there are vulnerable parts of the bag.I do not want my laptop to get wet that is why this is important.
5,Great book bag
5,I love this bag. Very convenient
5,Perfect size. Many compartments!
5,Love it
5,Great bag for traveling.
5,Very spacious and convenient
2,My daughter uses it for high school.  2 months it began to break
1,The charging port does not support fast charging of ANY kind and your devices will discharge faster than they charge. Returning item.
1,I ordered this for my twin sister who's in the medical field to carry all her things. She just decided to use it today and sees the that the USB for the charging port is smashed in and is unusable... it's past my return window so I can't even get it exchanged or contact the seller about it...Delores
2,Lots of pockets for organizing but only used it a month and its ripping at the seams
1,I actually loved the bag for traveling but once I put my stuff in… which wasn’t a lot the strap broken never got to use it
2,Disappointing since it was otherwise great.
2,Not protected with lock. You can still rip open enough to grab  small item out like a phone with the lock on.  Padded underneath is not thick enough to protect tablet from a drop.
1,I have had this backpack for about two months and one of the zippers is already broken. The quality of this product is horrible.
1,This product is absolute trash I guess I should’ve known when I saw the price and I should’ve totally ignored the 4 1/2 star reviews zipper broke my second time using it and I not only did it break it totally exploded Trying to zipper up my work shirt inside of it…never again
1,It was still functional but it ripped within the first 2 hours of using it. It also wasn’t super comfortable. I’ll be looking for a more quality bag.
1,I love this backpack because of the pockets and compartments.  It looks really nice too.  The zippers however are not so great.  After a couple of usages for travel the zippers started having issues.  They kept opening up on their own.  One time some of the items I had in the backpack fell out because the zipper opened own its own.  I would return but it’s pass the return window.  Definitely would not recommend.
1,I would keep it if the quality is better. Too bad it ripped.
1,It busted apart at the zipper seams. Bag is can no longer be used straps on one side rest of bag on the the it’s no longer a backpack it’s useless poorly made! If I could give it a ZERO STAR I WOULD BUT SINCE I CAN’T SUBMIT UNLESS I PUT ALEAST ONE STAR THIS IS THE ONLY WAY THEY GOT THAT ONE!
2,Seams rip pretty easily
1,After less than a month of daily school use by my 8th grade daughter a large tear has opened up along the top seam. She doesn’t carry excessively heavy books (kids today only carry a binder and their small school laptop) and doesn’t overstuff it. Based on the price point hadn’t expected to get multiple years out of this bag but did expect it to last at least one! Very disappointed in the quality.
1,I bought this backpack for my daughter for college. She loved the look of it. On her 3rd day of school the stitching started to come undone. Unfortunately we were past the return window because we bought it well in advance of college starting and she didn’t get the chance to use it before the return window closed. Very disappointed it didn’t last more than a few days. This backpack is not well made.
1,The bag do not charge anything unless it's plugged up
2,Durability for school is poor
1,I got this early excited and worried for my daughter starting in person class and having to bring her computer. With nothing in it it is heavy. Fine. Atleast it looks durable right?... Still excited about school I packed it up and ready for school this year then put it away. They didn’t start school till last Thursday over a month after I got it. Less then 2 days in and it’s ripping? It only carries a computer water bottle and chap stick...... Nope!!!
1,Only had for a month and already has a tear. Very disappointed.
1,The product is advertised by one of it's picture as 18.8" x 12.8" x 7.8" in dimension.In reality it's only less than 14" x 11" x 7". See picture attached (in the picture showing the width my thumb is at 8" of the ruler).This seller should be banned from amazon for lying.
1,Missing the anti theft lock
1,I thought I was getting a durable backpack but I’m not happy
1,My daughter bought this backpack for school in September. In less than 3 months the bottom ripped completely apart. She only uses it for school. 5 days a week. The total contents only weighed 10 pounds.It’s unacceptable how short it lasted for the quality promised.
1,i bought this backpack for high school and i carry a laptop and 2 binders that don't have anything in them yet and 1 note book along with a pencil pouch so its not heavy at all and i used it for 2 days and on the 2nd day it had 2 big rips in it. the durability is horrible and i couldn't fit everything in it
1,Bad quality. Had to return one and now have to buy another brand cause it busted again
1,Horrible backpack. I got this for Christmas loaded it up and it’s already ripped. Not happy with this backpack at all. Wish I had the option to return.
1,This bag is worst then sending your child to school with a hefty trash bag.  Less then 2 months since school started and the whole left side of the bookbag seam has ripped open.  This is horrible do not buy.  Now I have to buy another bag in less then 2 months!
2,Did not hold up
1,Fell apart within 2 weeks of use. Zippers came off and seems popped.
2,Liked the back back for school but the plastic piece on the shoulder strap broke after just one month
1,I like the design but the bag ripped (on the inside) after a month of light use.
1,Smaller than it appears in photos. USB charger port does not work at all to charge a phone.
2,First time use and already opened to where contents can come out. I barely had anything in the front pocket
1,I had the backpack for about 3-4 days when the strap broke. I had my laptop in there some clothes for over night at my girlfriends house and a small bottle of wine. I went to take the backpack off and it fell to the floor. Upon further examination the plastic piece that holds the strap together broke in the middle. I will NOT be purchasing another backpack and would highly suggest others search elsewhere.
1,I bought and replaced it twice and the book bag ripped while my daughter was at school both times! How embarrassing for her!!!!!!! Don’t buy it. The material is cheap. Looks can be deceiving.
2,Not worth the price.  Wired pieces arrived broken and the zipper broke after 6 months.
1,Sew quality is not good - pick another products
1,This backpack didn't even last 4 months of Junior high for my son. Seems have split and zippers are popping.  Don't buy it if you actually plan to fill it with books and a computer.
1,I bought this backpack for my 17 year old son and sure enough after 2 weeks of use the back strap is falling apart. I was hoping he would have been able to use it for his senior year which starts in August but the bag didn't even make it through part of his summer program at college. Totally disappointed!
1,Ripped in less than 6 months. I would like a refund please
1,I bought this bookbag on 11-11-21 and today my child came home from school with it ripped and all she carries is a pencil pouch her phone laptop and charger. Im highly upset
1,I bought this for work. The zipper broke so I can’t use it. I had the backpack for over a month and a half before I actually using it. After only about 3 weeks of usage the zipper broke on the back section and I cannot use it anymore.
1,Cheap quality. Sounds like it’s stuffed with plastic packaging. I rifled through all of the pockets before realizing it was the material the backpack is made out of making the crumpling plastic sounds.
1,Zipper was broken within the week of purchase. It was my sons school backpack. Not a quality backpack.
1,Product ripped and is now not able to perform  for its purpose. It didn't even last through the 1st quarter of the school year. I would like a full refund or new replacement of the exact same product.
1,Did not like it at all
1,Ripped after one week not durable for school books
1,It broke the second week of school.  Since we purchased early of course it was past the cut of to return it.  Too expensive for this.  I expected better
1,Backpack layout is good. It has lots of storage and pockets. I like that it is minimal in design. The material used is very plastic and feels cheap. i’m 6’2 and this backpack is tiny. Did not like it overall for traveling or work but might be ok as a weekender bag.
1,Backpack is falling apart need replacement or refund
1,My son has only had this backpack since August and the main zipper has broken through no fault of his.  Extremely disappointed.
1,The backpack has begun to fall apart after it was washed in a front load washer. With 3 children this is the first book bag that has fallen apart in less than 40 days.
1,This backpack worked fine for about 2 months of school. He doesn't carry that much or anything particularly heavy. Now the whole back pocket is ripping off.
5,This was bought for my daughter to use for school. She loves it!!! The item worked exactly like the description implied !!!!!
1,My 7th grader uses it for school. Zipper broke after a few months. Now the top strap broke. Poor quality.
1,Ripped inside after 1 month
1,Every time I put this backpack on the straps fall off.I put this backpack on one time and both straps released with my electronics in the back pack.Cheaply made horrible product.
1,This was poorly made. Use it for school (don’t even bring my books) and it broke within one month of use. Waste of money. Two thumbs down
1,Initially loved it but after just over a month of light use almost lost my laptop when I discovered it was literally coming apart at the seams.  Very disappointed
1,Ripped after the 3rd week of using it
1,The stupid zipper broke on the middle section in the backpack.
1,The straps tore away from the bag 2 weeks after using. Terrible durability and quality for the price. Very disappointed with this item
1,This product is worthless and does not hold up to holding even the lightest books it has torn from the stitches and is unrepairable.
1,Strap broke already
1,The zippers are broken after about 2 months of use.
1,This would have probably been a great back pack of it didn't have 2 zippers break the week we bought it. We fixed them then it totally blew out and broke again. It's going in the garbage.
1,Seam stitches broke causing my laptop to almost fall out. Steer clear at all cost
5,This is a great bag for carrying variety of things.  Good quality material.
1,Not enough space. Larger in picture than in person
1,Too small
1,I don’t use it often when I finally did the zipper broke on me and  another 2 are stuck.
1,Great bookbag but straps broke while on my back with just my laptop in it when it fell of my back my laptop broke.
1,Horrible to be that expensive
1,Zippers broke after a couple of months of occasional use not even everyday use. So disappointed.
1,The bottom already ripped only had it about a month and the side started to rip as well
1,The bag was too small for my son. He really didn’t like it.
1,
1,Have only had it for a little over a week and have only taken it out of the house twice and it’s already tearing. Will be returning
1,Only good thing was purchasing through a lightening deal so less money wasted.
1,Book bag ripped open on both sides!!!Huge holes after two months of use!!!
1,Zipper teeth come apart after it’s zipped.Only used on weekends
1,Cheap took on one trip for two day and it ripped up
5,Cute and functional bag. Lots is space for storage
1,Seemed like a great backpack but the zipper broke within 6 hours of use.
5,This purchase was the best. This laptop bag is so roomy and can fit multiple items besides your laptop.  It has comfortable straps for carrying and I highly recommend purchasing!
1,after 2 months the zipper broke. - Not happy. - other wise would have been a great bag
3,After 3 days of using this backpack for school we ended up switching to the High Sierra backpack my child has used for the past 4 years.  Unfortunately this bag is much too small for kids in middle/high school as they carry too many things like folders/laptop/lunchbox etc.  The strap also broke off on the very first day used not very good quality.
3,Definitely "Made in China" quality. Roomy and lots of pockets but I don't foresee it holding up the entire school year.
1,My backpack never charged
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Definitely a good backpack must have.I've had this for half a year and it's just so easy to carry and use.100% musthave
1,The zipper on this bag broke within 3 weeks...super bummed
1,Too small
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Too small
2,I used this backpack for grad school (pretty much just to carry my MacBook Air and planner to and from campus) and within 5 months of use the inside seams are ripping where the styrofoam between the liners are coming out. I'm really bummed because I really liked the compartmentalization of this backpack. Unfortunately it seems like there is no warranty so looks like I'll have to find a new backpack from a different brand.
2,I bought this a couple of months ago to use while traveling. I thought the quality would have been better but it is not.  I used it once and the seam is tearing already. When I received it looked fine however like I said after one use the seams are unraveling already. It is past the return date so its my loss I guess.
2,2 weeks in using it in a middle school my son has shown me that one strap stitch is already ripped apart just from the weight of a normal middle schooler's day.
5,I bought this for my husband and this backpack is super! It holds 2 MacBook Pro + 1 IPad Pro + 2 text books with no problems. It’s definitely a wise investment given how reasonable the price is!
1,
5,I got this for Xmas and went to vegas 12/29.  Love the bag but the attached usb doesn't work.  I had to go from charging block to phone to charge.  Love the bag....
5,We have another one very very similar....I would say same maker different name. This one is better mostly for the front pocket area. Instead of a tiny zipper pocket and a bigger one on the front this one has the bigger one then a side zip pocket large enough to hold a few things....think wallet passports etc. very comfortably. The inside with the mesh pocket area 3 different other holding areas and the laptop area are all superb. Well worth the dollars spent.
5,Bought this for my daughter who is a crisis counselor and she absolutely loved it
5,I love my backpack the price quality and simplicity of the style is great. I take it to work everyday I love it
5,Very neat and fits lots.
2,This is a brand new back and never used. Put a couple of clothes and the strap already broke. Don't waste money on this. Cheap.
2,Does not stand up to daily school use.
2,Loved this backpack so much but I’ve been through 2 now. Both have ripped carrying just my laptop and its accessories like the charger and mouse. Sad and won’t be purchasing another even though I love the purple color.
2,The straps and buckles are not well matched...they don't stay tight. First day wearing this pack the lower strap from the upper strap came undone caused backpack to fall. When it fell it caused the second one to come undone which then sent my bag to the floor breaking my laptop inside. No cushion. Interior material feels like paper...not too impressed
5,This is a very sophisticated but functional backpack. I like that it's got multiple pockets but not too many. It seems like it would hold up to a decent amount of weight and I like all the cool features like the hidden back pocket and usb charging port. I intend to use this as our "park bag" when we go to Disney later this year and I think it will be perfect. Big enough to fit all of our stuff but not too big to fit in the ride compartments when you have to put your bag away.
5,I really needed a backpack that can store a lot of items when I travel. This backpack definitely fit the bill where I could pack my laptop books electronics and some makeup items on the go! This fits under an airplane and can hold a water bottle on the side. There are efficient zippers to be used to get at your specific items quicky! I can't express this enough but it has been helpful on trips and school!!
5,It said anti-theft in the title and that's cool mine didn't get stolen so it has that going for it. A lot of pockets that's nice too. Definitely sturdy sat on it plenty and it was no worse for wear. Fit nice on the plane but airplanes are pretty big so I can't say I'm surprised. I'd say go for it if you need a backpack or if you're just feeling naughty.
3,Completely love it. I use it as a gym bag and my uniform including my boots fit.
5,Early Christmas for husband was a gift card from his job he gave it to me for myself I figured it was so unfair that he never gets anything he needed a back pack for work he’s a bus driver and this worked out perfect fits all his paperwork and both sides fits water bottles has usb for phn and headphones I even found room for a ice pack to put his lunches yeshhhh!!! He is a happy driver!
4,My son is using this for 6th grade.  Hopefully the durability will hold up since they do not have any assigned lockers and must carry everything in their backpack (chromebook workbook school supplies etc) the backpack is full! And we’ll see on the water resistance as our fall rainy weather is coming soon :)
5,I really like this backpack. It seems to be made out of good material and it my favorite color.
5,I like it for the locks that come with the bag to prevent other malicious people from attempting to steal also the design and color is really good since it's one of my favorite colors. It's really durable since i go out with it a lot and use it for school.
5,Love love love I bought this for school and it’s so perfect it’s big lightweight and good quality
5,This book bag has many pockets an hold alot of things. Its can be used for anything.
5,I bought this for my teenage daughter and she loves it! It even has a charger port!
5,My cousin loves it. He had no complaints whatsoever!
5,We purchased these in 5 different colors and every color was perfect!They are an awesome value and look fantastic.You simply can't beat it! I'd definitely buy them again!
5,Love it! Alot of space very comfortable
5,No pensé que fuera tan buena por el precio pero estoy sorprendido es muy buena
5,Muy buena para la universidad
5,Great buy! The kids loved them !
5,Exelente en todo espero sea bien durable
5,Terrible quality don’t buy it
5,Muy práctica y de buen material
5,Great product and fast shipping
5,Excelente calidad
5,Fits everything I need for school.
5,Love
5,Love that I can save my laptop and my ps4 in it very well
5,it worked out well for me.
5,Very nice backpack for the price. Great for traveling outdoor activities school and everyday life. Charger comes in handy as well as the water resistance. Big enough to carry textbooks with my laptop. Highly recommend and buying another already for a gift!
5,I’m using this for work and it’s the perfect size and well made to hold everything.
5,I use it for school. It has plenty of space. Fits my huge laptop with so much more room! I have binders as books and it's just amazing. It doesn't feel heavy on days that i have to pack all of my books and my laptop! I haven't used the charging port though! Besides that! It is a good buy!
2,I bought for my child to carry his chromebook in. Backpack was way too small. Can’t say whether it’s durqblw or water proof because I returned it
5,Satisfecho
5,Great Price. Great Product....
5,Great for work or fun! A little bigger than expected but perfect just the same!
5,I went on a 2 week hiking/traveling trip with this backpack and it came back looking like new. Perfect for flying because it's not too big but stores so much stuff
5,Great for work purposes
5,Great large  plenty room great backpack
5,Es resistente al aguatiene muy bien distribuidos sus espacioslo que hace que sea muy cómoda para llevar en la espaldaestá fabricado con excelente material lo recomiendo pues fue para mí una muy buena inversiónla comodidad y la felicidad que genera tenerla  no tiene precio es un buen artículo. Quedé totalmente satisfecha con mi compra! Gracias.
5,i used this backpack for school and it was able to carry everything i needed and more
5,Good bag
5,Love this backpack! It is functional and well made.
4,I expected it to be bigger little bit but its fine with everything
5,Amazing prize very comfortable and padded.
5,We used it for traveling and it was great!
1,I do not recommend this bag for kids who have to carry more than a couple of folders and lite paperwork.  My daughter is in 9th grade and had this backpack for right at 4 weeks when it tore. (See pictures)  She carried a two of 1 to 2 inch binders 3 paperback books that were about 4x7 inches along with pens pencils hi-liters etc.  It started with a small tear last week.  (I didn't think to take a picture.)  Two days ago it ripped further down the side and halfway along the bottom.
5,I needed this backpack for an upcoming trip and it came in handy. Lots of space and pockets. Looks stylish for a budget bag.
5,I have mine attached to my mobility scooter (instead of the usual basket). It has great capacity can be locked (you buy a lock separately) and it waterproof. It's marvelous for a few grocery items -no plastic bags!- or for holding assorted items that may make your theme park or tourist attraction easier to cope with. Also good for traveling- it fits underseat when flying.
5,Good quality
4,I bought this bag primarily for a laptop and it is overkill for just that.  If you want only a laptop bag there are much smaller and lighter options.  If you want to carry your laptop or other gear on a trip this is an excellent choice.  It feels very durable and though I've not had it out in a storm the fabric is a type that offers decent water resistance.  On trips I will definitely use the charging port and the outside water-bottle pouches.  The straps are sturdy and so far have not slipped when I've carried it even over a coat.  There is plenty of space and a number of smaller pockets inside for different things from pens and pads to energy bars books maps and of course a laptop and its power brick and external mouse.It loses a star only because as purely a laptop bag there are better lighter choices.  For more general purpose use so far it seems more like a five-star product.Update 06/12/2021  I've used this bag often enough and for long enough now to believe it is going to be durable.  Nothing has broken or ripped on it.  The water bottle pockets will fit the diameter of big 32 oz. containers but not really the depth; they'll be a little top-heavy and may fall out.The interior laptop compartment is nicely padded but the strap that secures it is probably 2" too long.  It will prevent the laptop from sliding out completely but does not provide a snug fit.  If it bothers me enough I'll take a needle & thread to it and loop off those two inches.To those asking about size it is probably 22L-25L based on its measurements.
5,I ordered this backpack to have something to carry my laptop and other essentials for work. I must say I quite enjoy this product and do suggest anyone who is looking for a compact but durrable backpack to purchase this item. It fits my 15 inch dell insperon laptop perfect and snug and leaves many pockets open for chargers power banks some snacks and a water bottle. 100 Percent recommend
5,I know it is a popular item and a choice of  only two colors so I added a decal on the front to limit any confusion with other travelers.  I did buy it for the Usb charging port for traveling  but it came with no instructions of how long it should be charged for and approximately how long it will last. But good quality and and I like the size.
5,Do not let the pictures fool you it is smaller than it looks. It is a decent size but the pictures make it look huge. It has alot of pockets and it looks amazing.
5,fits everything i need to carry daily between 2 buildings
1,Do not think this was new when arrived. Cheap enough just bought another brand
5,Nice bag Comfortable
5,There are so many pockets it’s awesome! Perfect for laptops and tablets. The charger is a game changer 😍
4,It's a great backpack with exceptional features. I like the USB charging port on the outside of the backpack and the padding for the laptop is good as well. The first one I ordered had a problem with one of the straps/plastic buckles that broke but a replacement was sent and no problems with the second one so far.Great product for what was needed.
5,Honestly for the price I wasn’t expecting what I got. Wow! This bag is super sturdy good looking and no joke…so much room it’s ridiculous! I swear I purposely filled this bag with everything I would need for a weekend away with no problem! Shoes clothing makeup electronics and much more. Not a problem! Worth every penny!
5,A lot of pockets and space and perfect for school
5,Love it
5,It's actually a pretty nice backpack handy tons of pockets perfect for what you need if you work on the go like I do
5,I love this backpack it holds all my stuff and it is a good quality bag! I will probably have this bag for a few more years of school!
5,I like this bag fit all my office stuff includes laptop
5,Has a lot of pockets good storage
5,Great book bag so much space and the convenience of the usb is great
5,This was one of the best backpacks we have purchased. It arrived before we traveled and it held up great for our Whole trip plane rides and backpacking to the beaches. Looks just as clean when we got home would definitely recommend it.
3,Es muy bonito pero la carga no le dura nada lo pongo a cargar toda la noche y cuando lo voy a usar en chorras de la tarde ya no tiene carga
5,Love it since I have no kids
5,I love this backpack for work. It has lots of pockets and space to put different items I need.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I wanted a bag that would fit everything I needed but not look too bulky. I think this was the perfect middle and it's mostly due to how well it was designed. Every pocket and space is used efficiently. I hate backpacks that have a million pockets and end up being more confusing than helpful this one has 2 big ones (for laptop and books/notebooks) 1 medium pocket (for gadgets chargers act)  and 2 smaller ones in the front that still have a lot of depth.The laptop section which is in the back is well padded and protected. I would say if you have a computer with width bigger than 8 inches/21cm than maybe steer clear. I don't have a lot to carry just a few books a computer and some chargers but if you have a lot of stuff get something bigger. Overall I liked this bag.
5,Arrived quickly and very useful and fashionable
5,I work on the go and needed something to hold files notepads and my laptop. This has been great!
5,This backpack is the perfect weekend travel bag.
5,Bought it for my son. He is rough with backpacks and needed one that would hold up. Had it for 3 months and he loves it so much. The charger port inside all the pockets. Great backpack.
5,Great for school and traveling
5,My husband loves this backpack for his day to day use. Black sleek and we got a great deal on it! Will be taking it out of the country soon and see how it does when extra space is needed.
5,It is water resistance
3,I’m embarrassed to say I didn’t look closely at the price before buying. I was expecting a high-quality bag. This backpack looks and feels very cheap. The interior of the bag is so thin and really cheap crinkly material. But when I realized it was a low-priced bag I decided to keep it. If you recognize you’re paying a low price for a low quality bag then you’ll be satisfied with this purchase.
2,It was great I loved it rated 5 stars… then 3.5 months it ripped on top! So mad smh
4,Great bag so far. Seems durable and it has many pocket and compartments. Battery section comes in handy. Comfortable to wear when packed.
5,This is the perfect "gotta go" backpack. It is beautiful with high quality fabric stitching & padded straps. The internal charging cable is a plus. The space & zippered pockets are perfect for all of my stuff and you know a gal needs her stuff!
5,Plenty of pockets for storage.  Nice material.  Zippers seem sturdy. Lots of room inside for laptop books binders folders. Comfortable straps even with the weight in the back pack. Quality for the price.
5,Perfectly held snacks laptop cables etc
5,Just received backpack. Super fast free shipping! I ordered a bunch of things but I guess they are coming from different places so arrival will be at different times.I’m impressed so far with the bag looks great and about the size I expected. I don’t know yet about it’s durability but I plan to put it thru the test. I don’t plan to go swimming with it but I’m guessing it repels rain. Pack an umbrella that is small enough to carry in the bags side pocket ;)$$ well spent and good value :)Note I used to have a brand name DaKine backpack that was expensive. Great bag but probably overpaid because this bag looks similar in size and has about the same amount of padding on straps and back of backpack. I will see if this bag lasts as long as my old name brand. ..just something to compare it to :D
5,Seems to be just what they described. Very happy with the quality and the usefulness of the product
5,I love this backpack for traveling. It has been my 1 personal item on a plane and has fitted EVERYTHING I needed for a 3 day vacation. Lots of pockets easy to organize your travel.
5,Great backpack love it
5,I have had mine for about a month and I love it!
1,I don’t like how small it is compared to the pictures .
5,I love the fact that it is so roomy. It has so many compartments....that is my favorite thing about the bag!!! You can fit a lot of stuff in this bag plus some!
5,The space and compartments in this backpack are absolutely superb!!!!  My son plays sports and it serves him well as everything - from a pin to an anchor holds in this backpack! I hope that when he starts using it he remains as excited as he is now.
3,I got the bag and the part to charge my phone is not working. I am very disappointed.
5,El articulo es de buena calidad la mejor compra que he hecho es bueno invertir en este articulo duradeeo fuerte buen material  resistance impermeable cien por ciento. Lo recomiendo.
5,Really happy with this backpack. Glad I didn't pay twice as much for a name brand.
5,The color is wonderful! This is perfect to carry my work items! Plenty of storage for organizing!
5,Great for those who live in wheelchairs
5,Beat backpack ever
5,Love this bag! Perfect for what I need it for and it is very durable for all the stuff I carry with me!
5,All is ok to my satisfaction
5,I wouldn’t change anything!
5,Good quality and designed with utility in mind. Perfect for commuting and air/metropolitan travel.
5,Great backpack for the price. I am a jet-set semi truck driver and I fly 2 times a month to drive semi trucks in another state. I am on the road for 3 weeks at a time in the Semi so I am limited to bringing only what I can bring on a plane.FLIGHT: I needed a backpack as a personal item for my flight. It worked great although if you have it packed super tight it's a struggle to get it under the seat in front of you but they just put it in the overhead bin for me no problem. Has a USB outlet on the side if you want to hook up a power bank for quick access to charge. I got a power bank to add to this bag that way I don't have to scramble to find an outlet in the airport.DURABILITY: For the price this thing held up well. It got caught under the seat of the plane and I yanked it a little too hard and some of the stitching came apart on the main handle but that was my fault I don't blame the bag for that. And I yanked it from one of the open front pockets once and some of the liner ripped but again I was trying to yank a very heavily loaded bag from the wrong spot so again that was my fault. I don't blame the bag for that. Overall it did great. I am a truck driver and was easy to get in and out of the truck. 20 degree weather ice and snow dirt mud.....I was constantly in and out of the bag for laptops stocking caps gloves flashlights snacks log books etc... A heavy amount of use in 3 weeks and it worked great.CAPACITY: It holds a LOT of stuff it's great for a personal item on the plane. I had my 15.6" laptop in there (fit perfect in the rear padded pocket) a Samsung Galaxy 10" tablet in the rear pocket chargers cables a pair of shoes 2 large books 2 paper trucking log books and a ton of other items. It fit a LOT of stuff in there. It also has a strap to put around the handles of your carry on luggage which is nice. Lots of convenient pockets everywhere for everything. I liked the 2 pockets on the front for quick access to my gloves vape pen charging cables boarding pass etc.SUMMARY: Killer bag for the price I actually just purchased another one in black. And a little secret: This is almost the exact same bag as the Matein backpack which is the highest reviewed backpack on Amazon. It is almost a side by side carbon copy. I assume made by the same people just rebranded for resale for another company... And this one is a little cheaper price than the Matein. If you keep in mind this is a $30 backpack and don't be too rough on it it will work out just fine. If you want a backpack you can drop off a mountain there are $200 backpacks out there that are made for that.... This will get the job done for 90% of the people out there.*Yes it is shipped folded in half I see people posting pictures of this and were unhappy it came this way. Put a laptop or something stiff inside it and it straightens out in 5 minutes. Or fold it the opposite way for 5-10 minutes. Some people just have no common sense.
5,I was looking for a backpack for college and bought this based on the reviews. I'm glad I did. It's so spacious and good quality. Has many pockets which I love! Shoulder pads are so comfortable. Definitely recommend.
5,Used in traveling on airplane and was great.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             It’s so amazing and i love it so so so much!!!
5,Great backpack for the price plenty of pockets.  Seems well made zippers seem to be of good quality if the zippers break than the bag is worthless but these zippers look good!
5,These are great for teenagers. I have only had to replace one but that thing has been used and abused for almost 2 years before it finally gave out. Will buy again.
5,
5,Traveled recently and was happy to have this. So many pockets! For sanitizer masks and then the stuff I want to carry 😃
5,I bring this backpack everywhere. It holds my laptop 15' drawing tablet and all other traditional drawing supplies. It's very versatile in use and I have used it for travel work and hobbies all at the same time. My wallet and other valuables are kept safe in the anti-theft pockets or when locked. Though I don't think I would use it for school supplies as some others have if your child has large books to carry around school or to and from home it's going to wear a lot faster which is where I've seen a lot of the negative durability reviews come from. When I have all my items in there the weight is about 13lbs. I have had zero issues of tearing frayed edges or damage at all in a year of use every day. Great product.
5,Better than my old Jan Sport.
5,this is the best backpack i have ever purchased from amazon i have a place for everything i need my laptop tablethard drive phone water bottle and anything else i could need or think of. well worth the price i paid highly recommend
5,I love how many pockets this thing has. My MacBook is well protected. Only issue in shipping they folded the bag in two. Since then whenever I take out the computer the bag folds back in half and doesn’t stand on its own. Don’t know if it’s designed like that or they broke the spine of the bag when they packed it.
5,Great backpack at a great price. Tons of compartments! The instructions for the zipper lock could be clearer but otherwise this is a great multi-purpose backpack.
5,I searched and searched on Amazon for a new backpack and chose this one because so many people gave it 5 stars. They were absolutely right!  I don't know what else you could want or need in a backpack. The backpack is so well designed with pockets for everything side pockets for water bottle or umbrella and even comes with a small padlock to lock zippers. I love the back-side zippered pocket for money or passport.  It's also lightweight but very well made.
5,The product is light weight and has many compartments
5,While my backpack has yet to be put through the rigorous testing that my wife's has this backpack is still just as awesome. Our new puppy peed on hers and it went through the washer no problem at all and I air dried it on our shoe rack. It washed out perfectly. It fits as much as you would have put in your backpack in high school if you were one of those people that visited their locker twice a year. Comfortably. It has spots for everything. My wife has a room in our house just for office supplies. She still has spots left to fill in this backpack. I'm sensing that we're approaching a near magical-level bag-of-holding but I can't be sure.It has a spot for your charging block with a cord to attach it to a usb port on the shoulder so you can plug your phone into that instead of feeding a cord through the backpack or keeping the block in your pocket and looking like a dork. At this price that's a completely unnecessary addition but a well thought-out quality of life addition nonetheless. And I love that they are so dedicated to helping me eliminate the various ways that I make myself look like a dork. They're spitting in the desert but I appreciate it.Also if you pack like children like my wife and I this easily holds your weekend travel clothes/toiletries/books/rocks/sticks/trees/...Spike.... (The Land Before Time reference)
5,Nice backpack. But its not water resistant.
1,Que mal megusto mucho pero el dia que dejaron el producto nunca la resibi 😥
5,Great bag easy to clean. I used HTV on it and it worked out... FYI do NOT use HTV on the straps or the back! The foam inside melted! The front held up well.
5,LOVE IT went to Aspen Colorado this month in December in the Snow.  Just like it saysDurable and water resistance plenty of room to put many items in it I had a pro iPad in my bag and there was no damage at all
5,Used for traveling. Everything fit
5,I was scared it would be too small but it’s the perfect size for school backpack!! Has a laptop sleeve multiple compartments and zippers. I love that it includes a lock and USB charging plug-now I don’t need to look for an outlet to charge my phone or laptop!
5,Durable!
3,Some answers claimed that a 17” laptop would fit in the bag. As can be seen I can’t zip up the bag all the way with my slim profile 17” gaming laptop. Maybe the item dimensions were measured wrong or a got a slightly smaller bag than normal. I will be keeping the backpack for work though seems good quality. A shame that the bag may unzip when I go out of town with my laptop.
5,It has lots of pockets
2,It's a really cute bag works really well except for the handle has torn at the seams way-too-early only had it a few months
1,The cord on the USB cord built in to the bag was damaged when the bag arrived. The overall construction seemed OK not great.
5,Muy espacioso y de excelente calidad.
5,Best investment ever. I will recommend
5,Very light weight
5,Great quality for the price!
5,Good amount of space for anything you want to put in the bag. Has many pockets for any miscellaneous things you have and its pocket for the laptop fits mine perfectly.
5,Excelente para viajes cortos. Es espacioso y cumple con los requisitos de las líneas aereas.
4,This backpack seems to be pretty good quality but their quality control needs some help when I got this backpack one of the zipper sections is got about a 5 in or 6 in section that doesn't look like it made it through the sewing machine so there's a big opening in the backpack on one of the zippers but otherwise the backpack seems to be a good quality
5,Great little backpack to take the work it has a lock on it so you can't open your backpack which I like because I like bringing my medicine with me it has a phone charger and it lots of space.
5,Has a lot of pockets and compartments.  Serves its purpose.  Good price for the material.  Longevity has yet to be questioned.  Will keep you updated.
5,Holds alot of stuff plus the chrome book. Highly recommend
5,I took the bag on a travel trip and this is a durable backpack. Has enough pockets as well. I will recomend it.
5,I really love this back pack. The quality really surprised me. It’s so nice and such a good price. I got it for my middle schooler and it’s perfect for organizing his supplies. My sons school doesn’t have lockers so having a backpack with enough pockets for organizing all his supplies is a must! Would buy this again. My son also said it felt lighter on his back because it evenly distributed the weight.
5,Cant wait to put it to use.
4,It is very good for travelling.
5,Great product
5,Used this for travel.  It's a great bag. It fits tons of stuff. Better than I thought.  I highly recommend this bag.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Pretty good overall havnt tested it in water to much but seems like it would hold up
5,Exactly what I needed! The compartments are great! Durable lightweight spacious without being bulky. Perfect for traveling or school.
5,This backpack is wonderful!!! It's very spacious and durable!
5,I needed a new book bag for school and one that could hold my laptop without damaging it. It has three separate pockets that are great just for that! it’s really durable and you can feel and tell that its made by great materials. It also has “anti theft” pockets in the back that is great for putting in your phone or important stuff. I’m sure it’ll last me for a couple years!
5,Just what I needed for my new job!  Fast Shipping.
5,I use this for college and it’s AMAZING. So many compartments which makes it easy to organize and it’s great quality!
2,this is a super cute book bag but! If you were buying for high school or middle school and expect to be caring computers and books or anything heavy I definitely would not recommend it. I’ve only had it for a little less than a month and it’s ripped in three different spots.:(
5,I love this backpack and all of its little compartments. Different areas for different stuff like keys wallet and phone and the built in system for having a portable battery. I definitely recommend this backpack.
4,Seems to be well constructed and durable. I would buy it again.
5,Thank you the book bag 🎒 amazing quality!
5,A mi hija le encantó por la comodidad. Tiene muchos bolsillos y su laptop se acomoda muy bien en la mochila.
5,I like this bag because is perfect for a short journey for go on a flight and is comfortable on your back.
5,I love this backpack.  It's smaller- which suits my laptop....with lots of additional storage and pockets.
5,Dude there’s so many pockets a key ring and a thing to charge your phone. For the price this was a absolute amazing backpack.
5,Liked the many pockets and loved the charging connection.
5,Will be using for school it is a great size love the color fits alot in it
5,I love it.. lots of storage space…not to big..
5,Todo perfecta para mi viaje
5,For work very well built
5,This backpack has a lot of pockets for everything you need. It’s incredibly durable and will last a long time.
1,I was so excited to get this backpack to take with me on my world travels. After my first gentle trip this bag was ripping in three places at the seams! What a disappointment as the design and pockets of this bag are fantastic and I was so excited about using it for years to come. Unfortunately I just wasted my money and now I will be going back to Jansport which has an inferior design but a superior durability
4,I love this backpack very roomy seems sturdy comfortable to carry around EXCEPT the mesh side pockets. They are too loose to actually hold in a water bottle and one tore within the first few days of using it. Otherwise GREAT backpack but I do miss the convenience factor of having the water bottle right there at hand!
5,We bought two of these for my children as they are assigned  a laptop. Seem to be great for modern school or overnight visit and they have a strong feel. All in all we are very satisfied with the purchase.
5,Really solid bag. Not to big or not to small perfect size bag. Holds my laptop nice and all my other gear I put inside. The key holder is super cool and really convenient to use Highly recommend.
5,Overall good product. Value for money.
5,Very nice bag lots of space for my books and laptop and love the USB on the bag comes in handy
5,I like the fact that this product is sturdy and it has a lot of places to store the things that i need to travel with. it holds my laptop my tablet the cords that goes with them and i also have room to carry extra clothes if i need to.  the two mesh pockets on the side are great as well as the bigger one in the back of the bag.
5,Husband loves Christmas gift.
5,This backpack is GREAT.Though I haven't used it for carrying a laptop around (yet!) it's got more storage than I could ever imagine. I personally use it for commuting on a bicycle to work so it goes through a little bit of wear-and-tear daily yet no signs of damage yet a month or so of use later.I absolutely love the purple color even if the logo on the front is a little bit tacky. I do have a couple other minor complaints though not enough to give this any less than 5 stars.Pros:+Nice color+Tons of pockets+OK comfort levelsCons:-Pockets seem to be meant for more flat items like documents a little hard to stuff things like clothes into it-Water resistance isn't anything special compared to other backpacks (but still good enough)Overall if this backpack falls in your budget I say you can't go wrong with it honestly.
5,Great size very sturdy and durable my girls love that it hold all their books for school
4,Comfortable and many compartments
5,I've been using this bag for a year and a half I'm a art uni student and everything pictured stays in this bag and there's still room for me to throw in extras I need each week like aprons slippers laptop paint etc. I love this bag it's hard-wearing and with my books I've never had issues with water getting in and it still looks pretty much new just one dob of paint I can't get out I also get a lot of back pain and this bag has a great amount of padding and never makes the issue worse I highly recommend this bag to anyone who needs a large capacity bag or who has back pain
4,Lovely design. I have bought 3 so far as with hard usage you get 6 months wear out of them. For the price iam okay with that.
4,So far so good. I like all the compartments which keep everything nice and tidy.
5,Not sure if it’s water resistant as I haven’t got it wet yet. It is nice quality though and the 3 pockets are spacious
4,It is high quality there are many pockets but I was expecting more space to carry clothes.It is great to the office school but not really for traveling.
5,Tried a few different Rucksacks before settling on this one. Very versatile with lots of pockets and compartments. Useful USB charging port included. Appears to be quite robust but time will tell. Cannot comment on waterproofness yet as not used in the wet. All in all a useful Rucksack.
5,Everything is perfect
5,meet my desired need
4,I returned this item it was to small for my laptop  however the quality was good
3,I have given this 3 stars but the stitching is coming undone on top of straps. An inside zip is broken and an internal pocket has stitching comw undone as seen in all photo's. There is no way on line of returning this item after one month unless the seller would like to vantact me and talk to me about it?
4,Bought it for bits and pieces to go in for trucking.Had it less than three months and zip gone on one section and only use it about three times a week!Waiting to see what company do.
3,I have used it 5 times and its tearing at seems. TBH I bought the bag because of its capacity but the quality isn't great.I wouldn't buy it again.
4,Convenient shape and size.Holds everything I need as a Carer visiting a shop or Cafe. Seems sturdyI am often distracted in a taxi should have gone for brighter colour.
4,Loads of space after I fit 2 laptops in there ...
4,lots of pockets. nice and tidy
3,The backpack seemed pretty robust when we got it it seemed well put together with plenty of useful pockets etc. My son  was pleased it initially however after a few months one of the zips went and a month after that another did. I would have preferred it to have had more robust ones fitted. This time we will be looking for all round strength stitching and zips.
5,Before I write my review I must disclose I am an amazon employee in the UK.I bought this rucksack mainly to transport my laptop around but also to use for work. When it first arrived I must say I was impressed with the quality it's big enough for most tasks and also has 2 compartments (one for normal rucksack use and the other for a laptop)inside the rucksack is a USB wire which you plug into your own power bank (these can be bought cheaply on Amazon) and the pouch on the back inside the rucksack is big enough for most.  I've found myself on break times just charging my phone from my rucksack which is nice and easy while I'm eating my lunch.  I was even more surprised a few days later when I found a padlock as well which was supplied to secure the zipsThe rucksack is comfortable to wear all in all and my laptop is secure inside the rucksack but id imagine you could fit other electronics inside such as a tablet or switch ect
4,I love it! It’s great but the charging unit is a bit slow (that also could be the power bank I was using) and the zip popped open when closed once but overall the bag is great. It has so many departments perfect for all my needs and it came with a lock too which is great. You can use this for work or travel. It’s very lightweight too and can fit quite a lot. Really happy I got it 🙌
5,We were able to fit so much into this rucksack when travelling abroad the three separate sections made it easy to separate out travel documents and items that needed to be easily accessible from clothes etc. Loads of excellent pockets feels very sturdy and comfortable to wear! The sleeve on the back that secures the rucksack to a suitcase handle was also very handy.
4,The bag is very comfortable to travel with only if you have a few things to carry.
5,After not havibg changed my bag for over 10 years I could not believe how good this was. Looks small yet very spacious with good number of sections and smaller pockets.The inbuilt USB charging cable has been very useful.
4,Hop on the top came unstitched after a few day of use
4,Enough room for your IT stuff and a little bit more
5,Good quality with plenty of pockets for various items.Has a Usb port so you can carry a power pack as well to charge various devises.Perfect size for under seat baggage.
4,I brought this rucksack for a 3 day holiday I'm going on next week and I was pleasantly surprised by it on a arrival it's got loads of space and different pockets and is a very decent weight on my back.I like the fact it has hidden pockets too to avoid theft.I can't wait to try it out properly on my holiday and you can't really complain for the price.It might wear and break easier then a more expensive one but with the price it wouldn't be a huge dent in my pocket to replace.
5,Will buy this again.
3,I bought this laptop bag and am so happy with this product.But I was lucky to get this item as when the delivered my disabled mum went answer door and found item stuck behind bin outside and driver had gone as didn’t wait and thanks to this driver my mum had fall and had have emergency care support assistance help her up this is only way I can write a true reply on this product.
4,It has space and it looks great but after one trip the handlers starts to rip off. I had to carry just the laptop a 500ml water bottle and some crackers so It wasn't heavily used.
5,Really spacious room for all of my office equipmentPlus it’s added extras of phone charger port for your bankI love this bagComfortable too with the paddingWould highly recommend
5,More space
5,It looks small but you can get an awful lot in it. I thought it would be cheap and nasty but was pleasently surprised on receipt. The base could do with having some rubber feet added to it (I have done this) but that would be my ony criticism.
5,Amount of storage capacity
5,Great value for the price and just as useful as my previous back pack which was 5x the price. Early days so not sure on durability and no rain yet but very pleased.
5,I bought this as my last backpack zipper broke and I needed a new one for work. It’s not very spacious - but then I didn’t expect it to be (hence the 5* review) It does the job for what I need plenty of pockets and a lock for anti theft. It also seems to hold up on the waterproofing
4,Purchased for my partner to take to work as his laptop bag wasn’t big enough.He loves this and is amazed by how much he can fit in.Only disappointment was that it had been folded in half when sent so it didn’t look great on arrival as it was bent in half. Looked fine once filled though
5,carrying my laptop
4,It has sufficient space for all travellers bits and pieces. Some smaller  pockets would be helpful
5,Great for taking on a plane-good capacity. Very secure.
5,This bag is amazing has plenty of pockets so not only holds your laptop but all your accessories too
5,This is a great little item perfect for storing all the tech I take with me and really comfortable to carry. The usb port for connecting a powerbank is a god send well worth the money.
5,Couldn't fault it.
5,Use for work travel  can for lunch box uniform water bottle  although have to put water bottle inside as the compartment at the side is not deep enough
5,good product spacious and excellent to wear its padded straps help the impact with the body excellent product in fact I have bought another one
5,You get a lot for yr money  so many pockets  plus well made.
5,I can get all of my photography stuff into it with out issues and there is still plenty of room
5,The product came in with great quality and very quickly.Has lots of space so it's perfect for travelling if you don't wanna take too many bags with you.
5,A great value for money product
5,Short flight  Weekend break  perfect size  comfortable  no hassle
5,This bag looks great but within 6 weeks of light use the handle stitching has completely broken. It is just not fit for purpose. No return option and no way of contacting the manufacturer. Don’t waste your money. Look elsewhere.
5,Great little backpack I got it for work ideal size to carry lunch box a jacket etc would be good for school or gym loads of pockets 10/10
5,Excellent product
5,It looks quality. It's value for money. I will definitely recommend 👌 👍 ☺️
5,Good quality quick delivery. My 15.6inch computer fit well and many other things.
3,Great bag but not tough enough for school. Love the compartments and padding but zip broke after 3 months!!
3,A bit to many pockets but a good little laptop bag fits quite a lot but a bit hard to find stuff I end up opening up all the pockets just to find 1 thing and don't put anything loose in there like pens or something small as you probable won't find it for a while but not bad if you are organised but I still end up with all my stuff pulled out as I can't stand loosing stuff it's like a bag never ending pockets not what I want to do when out and about
4,It’s a very strong bag good size for all my school folders
5,I’m a college student and I have a lot of books to carry all the time. This bag came today and already I love it. It fit all of my necessities in a really nice SLIM fit design. It can even fit my huge binder that I carry around sometimes and my water bottle. Definitely would recommend and buy again. Great service and delivery time too!
5,Bag arrived as described and have to say it’s one of the better bags I’ve owned. Plenty of room in it for all my stuff as I’m a tanker driver and still have space left for other bits. Worth the money I’ve paid for it and seems really durable. Not tried the waterproof as not been out in the rain with it.
5,like it very much use everyday
3,Great design seemed good quality but already ripped insidec
3,Too small
5,This bag holds plenty with lots of compartments it's a little to big for me but a good well made bag. The straps on the back are a bit too wide for me so feel a bit clumpy. I can't comment on the water proofness yet due to not being out in the rain with it but I'm sure it will be fine that way too.
5,Bought it for my husband we took it on holiday. He loved all the pockets in it a bit for his keys etc.
5,My son needed a big bag to put all his books and kit.  Previous ones we brought kept wearing out.  This bag is so much bigger with lots of sections and pockets.  The bag is very comfortable for him to carry and so much space.
5,Nice bag
4,This seemed agood buy for my son to be used as his school bag. So he says it quite good ! It has plenty not space in it with lots of zipped compartments and he takes a lot of stuff! He's been using it since last year and it still works welllooks as good..no ripstearszips all work. So it's a strong big bag that does the job well.
5,I use this daily and I get a new one each year.  I'm considering buying a couple just to have as it's great quality and works very well for me.  Thanks
5,I got this backpack as a replacement for my sons school bag. He's been using it for months now and I have to admit I am pleasantly surprised it's still going on strong despite what I'm sure he is putting it through.Its has plenty of pockets for everything he might think of putting in it which includes a laptop plenty of work books and the occasional PE kit (yes with trainers included).Excellent buy for us and when it eventually succumbs to the torture its enduring I will be replacing it with the same one.Totally reccomend it.
5,This rucksack is exactly what I wanted - absolutely ideal for short business / pleasure trips and flights and caters for absolutely everything you need on such a trip .....
5,I bought this bag for work To put my stuff in I thinking about buying another one for travelling as it has different compartments for my iPad and charge  mobile phone and lots of storage very impressed Excellent quality
2,Very basic materials with enough pockets for all items
5,Good
3,Not the best quality
5,Bought it for my son as a school bag he simply loves it .. Water resistant  highly durable and comfort
3,The usb female connector is damaged ....can't please usb male in complete
5,just what i needed very good quality
5,Looks nice.. very well made ..lots of compartments.. usb wire... well padded Great for my sons college things.  Usually but named brand but will always but this one now ..HAPPY ME..
5,recommend this backpack for travellers
5,I bought this because it has a separate iPad/laptop compartment. The bad has so many storage compartments and is so durable! I have stuffed it full with heavy items on international trips and it has been excellent! Love it so much bought one for my partner! I also love how it has the ability to charge!
5,Bought for my teenager and has the seal of approval. Particularly liked the internal pockets and the size - not too big not too small.
5,Plenty of pockets and compartments for all my needs. Dedicated pocket to keep my laptop from being knocked around. Comfortable to carry and the included USB connection is great for discreetly charging my devices from my portable charging bank(battery bank not included).
5,Having just bought these bags I can't really give any other result apart from 5 stars as everything seems to be great..at the moment. They are a good size and the material seems good quality and thick. There are plenty of pockets. And the straps are comfortable and can be lengthened to suit each child.If anything changes I will update my review. But atm we are more than happy with our purchase.
5,Good backpack for travelling. 17’’ laptop fits in without problem
5,Bought this for my daughter for school. Impressed with the number of sections and the fact it is really durable to be thrown around school floors playground.  Highly recommended
2,The bag was far too small for a 15.6 laptop to fit along with other items.
3,My son has to carry a lot of heavy books to school each day plus a laptop so I did a really thorough investigation of all the various laptop bags on Amazon and chose this one.  We were delighted when the bag arrived as the design is excellent.  However my son has only used it for a term and the fabric has already torn where the hand handle is (not the rucksack straps).  It's not reparable so it's going to have to go in the bin sadly.  Trying a different make this time.
5,Loads of compartments and very good quality well worth the price
5,Great price for a good product  I wish if it was more spacious but good enough
4,Perfectly decent bag. 1 downside is that the straps don’t grip enough in the adjustment clip.
3,Not recommend only last a couple of weeks
3,
4,Not the greatest bag you will ever buy but taking into the account the price it’s fairly good value
5,Brought this for my son as a school bag and it’s great. He can fit everything he needs in it and still has spare room. The different pockets on it means he doesn’t have to remove everything from his bag every time he needs anything. Only small issue is the straps keep loosening
4,not too bad
3,I've had to have this sewn up several times as it keeps tearing waste of money
2,I bought this backpack as I needed something that was durable. While I am happy with its storage capacity within only 72 hours I noticed that there was already loose fabric from the stitching in a few areas and that part of the badge of the logo on the front backpack had already come loose. This is rather disappointing as was described as “sturdy ensure a secure & long-lasting use daily.”
5,Very good Rucksack for my laptop well padded and plenty of pockets for bits and pieces
5,Really highly recommend this !! Thanks to this supplier it is a strong sturdy and comfortable bag 🎒I simply love this bag for work !!Please buyer's its a great deal and worth every hard earned penny ...thanks QUINOL U GUYS ARE REALLY GOING TO BE BLESSSD FOR SUPPLYING SUCH AN AFFORDABLE AND HIGH QUALITY ITEM IN THESE HARD TIMES!!
2,Just opened up this bag from out the packaging and one of the inside pockets were ripped at the seams not very happy about it but can live with it I guess just not the best thing to see from a £20+ bag
5,Brilliant value for money. Well made and comfortable to carry.
1,Zip broken after 2 days use. I bought this bag a week onto the school holidays but unfortunately by the time my son has used it and it broke it had gone past the 30 days return policy. Do not buy!!!!
5,This bag is great for college i can fit my 15 inch laptop and all my books ect and luch at the same time there are some many pockets for lots of things its great 👍.I got two one for me and one for my son for high school.
4,Good bag lots of pockets and loads of space
2,Bought this as a need due to my previous bag breaking. And as an interim until a bag I really want is available. But the inner lining broke after a few months. Bag wasn't even overfilled. Just ripped. It can still fully close. But build quality is sub par.
5,This is fantastic value for money.  It has so many compartments so everything can be kept tidy. Easy and comfortable to wear.Highly recommended.
5,Really nice bag. Comfortable and huge.
5,Can fit a lot of tools in this bag great for work
2,Size and design and comfort are ideal. After 6 weeks of my son using for high school one zip pull has come off. Luckily that zip has 2 zip pulls so we can still close the bag. The carry handle has pulled out from one end. The two main zips that get used the most have signs of weakness all along and are not good enough quality. I am hoping it will last a few more weeks but probably only 1 term. I was obviously hoping for minimum 1 school year as I hate adding to landfill. I recommend a different rucksack for high school that gets used a lot. This is not sturdy probably ok for office.
4,Good value
5,Brilliant product plenty of space
4,Will mainly be using this for work plenty of deep pockets and zip compartments galore its a comfortable well padded bag early days yet but I'm impressed with the quality for the price.
2,Decent bag terrible zippers always get jammed and break off. Has happened to 3 different bags.
5,I really like the different compartments in the bagX there is a a lot of space to carry all my belongings to work. It’s a really comfortable to wear. Would recommend this product
4,I wanted a backpack that I can cycle with. For the price it’s excellent! Lots of different compartments. The zips aren’t great but for the price I’d buy again.
2,Great size quality is fine not as shown in pictures inside lining has been torn after 10 days use on daily basis to work.Decent enough for the price I paid but expected more as per the item discription.
5,So the bag is very very nice with the amount of space you get for the amount of money you pay. It is also very comfortable how ever I have not testet the water proof stuff but it’s a 10/10 traveling bag
5,Bought for my son for school. Durable and plenty of space inside for all his things. He loves all the separate compartments for his things
5,I'll definitely recommend this item for the people that are on a budget. It's has a lot of space. Lots of pockets as well and well arranged in terms of managing space in it!
5,I love this bag I use it everyday for work and it is so sturdy. I can fit everything in it and know exactly where everything is. I love the fact that there are so many compartments. It’s such good quality and value for money. The seller was brilliant too so I would highly recommend.
5,Best rucksack I've ever bought.
5,I like that the bag is spacious strong and lightweight. It was beyond my expectations
5,Very good but Christmas gifts
2,Bag looks similarly made to that pictured but arrived with thinner less durable fabric. Okay for a cheaply made bag but would cost a lot less anywhere else. Don't see where it is anti theft. It's a normal bag easy to access from the back and easily accessible to theives. So not anto theft. Not worth the price would suggest buying at Primark.
1,Carry handle and rear compartment stiching has failed after 3 months of very light use approximatley 6 trips. Not good quality AVOID
4,I use it for work really good bag shame I didn't come with the charge adapter too
5,Bought this for work holds laptop and charger in 1 part. Everything I usually have in my handbag plus my diabetic kit and meds. Lots of pockets
5,I was caught in a downpour when I arrived back in my house it was the only dry thing with me
1,I bought this rucksack mid March and it was broken by mid May. See attached pictures. The top handle has come off.I contacted the seller end May and I am yet to receive a response of any type.Needless to say I am utterly dissapointed both with the rucksack and the seller. I don’t recomend it at all.
1,Poor quality
2,Plastic clip snapped after putting a laptop in it and now I can’t get a refund.APPALLING quality.
5,This is a big sturdy bag I use mine for work it has a lot of pockets that has zips and inside of these large pockets are various smaller pockets haven't used the USB that's attached and this is well concealed the material is of good quality and comfortable on your back with extra padding great value  delivery was very quick would recommend.
1,Awful back the zip broke in less than 3 months it is now useless because it won't close.
5,Got one for my husband and ended up getting another for my daughter. They love  their backpacks!!
5,Very happy with purchase
4,Does the job lots of places to put stuff recommended
3,Hi all very disappointed as one of the pockets has ripped already have not had this rucksack long.
5,I got this for my husband as he started a new job and he loves it.
5,It is comfortable right number of sections and easy to use.
5,An utterly awesome product. Seeminglessly endless pockets and sections for any conceivable item. Smart comfortable to wear or carry. Chuffed to bits with it. 😁
5,Good bag with lots of pockets
5,Bought for my son - he's happy so it must be good
4,well
5,Does what was intended for good size
5,So strong and passed down with rain and still held itself up. Top quality
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I'm very disappointed in this product and i regret buying it. It looks good on the outside but the quality is rubbish
2,My son loved this bag for school the amount of pockets and room was perfect for him! Unfortunately the first day back at school first lesson of the day one of the zips literally became de attached from the bag. So had to order a new bag on the first day of school. Such a shame the zips did not match the quality of the rest of the bag
5,perfect good price
5,Use this to carry school folders very trusty
5,This is a great backpack I've used it as a travel diaper bag and worked perfectly. I've also just used it as a laptop bag and is great. Love all the compartments. Very spacious. Comfortable back padding. Very happy with this.
3,The zip is very fragile should have been more durable.Wish I could return it.
5,Bought for someone else who seems happy with it. Seems strong and looks nice enough plenty of pockets.
4,A decent bag for ferrying my stuff to work.
5,Good backpack
1,Brought for my son as a school bag not even used it when started to put his stuff in the zip broke very disappointed.
5,I use this game everyday and I feel a bit my Mary Poppins with it. There’s just so much space and I can fit so much in it. So many compartments- which I love ! Very comfortable.
5,Nice item but needed bigger bag
4,No comments
5,Good all round bag for laptop

5,I bought for my kids! Heavy used! Good material water resistance. It’s surprise me!!!
5,Very good back pack. I got it due to having to carry around 10kg in textbooks regularly and its perfect. Fits everything without becoming too bulky 100% water resistant and sits comfortably.
5,It's a great size well made and lots of storage space.
5,Great item as described it is comfy to carry around and has lots of space inside the multiple compartments. Would recommend and as a bonus it was delivered very quickly.
2,Good size bag lot's of compartments well designed looked ideal for my son as he's just started secondary school and needs to carry a lot of stuff around with him. However within a few days it had torn. Not impressed.
2,The picture showed to me that the size was good for a adult yet tbh its abit small for my 12 year old son for school and the USB cable is rubbish
1,Love this bag it really is a very good product up until the zip has broken off the front pocket
5,Fit for purpose. Good price. The product is exactly what was needed.
1,Bought in February and already falling to bits. Can’t return through Amazon as that window shut in March not impressed very poor quality.

5,Best value for money very big and lots of pockets inside
5,The product is really good value. Loads of room for your different things that you take on your travels.
1,Looked liked a good bag but company failed to deliver. According to the tracker they got it from Swansea to Banbury no problem but then failed to get it the last 40 miles due to “external factors “.
5,Perfect for school
1,My reviews of this terrible bag keep being removed just amazon proving they will peddle any old rubbish and hide how bad it is. The main zip lasted approximately 3 minutes of use the good news is the bag is water resistant but without a zip this is pretty useless there is no rigidity in the back to protect your laptop and whilst I am careful with my work stuff the reason I got a new backpack is to protect stuff in more than a paper bag which this resembles in fragility. I would not recommend 9h and an added bonus I found this morning is that the main zip can and will open spraying the contents all over the road.
5,Good simple product. Excellent space and sturdy to boot.
2,The durability of this bag is non existent tore within a couple of weeks and the seams tore within a month. Shame really because the functionality of the bag is great
5,Size + quality great plenty of compartments lightweight + sturdy perfect.
5,Good value for money. Does the job. As advertised.
1,The media could not be loaded.
5,One of the zip a little flimsy other than that it’s a great bag
5,Strong loads of compartments looks good very decent bag fkr the price 👌
1,Only ordered a month ago only used this bag for 2 weeks as I had 2 weeks off work. Falling apart already. DO NOT BUY A WASTE OF MONEY!
1,Poor durability of this item.  Do not waste your money. Received beginning of Jan started using mid Jan and by mid feb strap has stared to rip.
2,Design is good but the stitching is coming out on the inside of the back pack for no reason I use the back pack for work and all I really keep is a pen and note pad tablet charger and water bottle. No reason for the back pack to fall apart.
5,Simply love it
