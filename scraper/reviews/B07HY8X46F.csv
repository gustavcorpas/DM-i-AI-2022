4,Fusion 5 10.1" Windows 10 TabletI picked up this tablet as an upgrade to my Kindle Fire 8". Overall I'd say it was a good choice.Initially I began shopping for a 10" version of my same tablet but I thought why not upgrade a bit in the process?  Since most of my other equipment is in the Microsoft ecosystem I chose to go with a Windows tablet. That way I can sync easily between my desktop phone and tablet having all my data available from any device.When I first started shopping my gut instinct was to pick up the MS Surface Go which is a 10" Windows 10 tablet. The down side is that Windows is running in S Mode. Windows 10 in S Mode is a more limited locked-down Windows operating system. In S Mode you can only install apps from the Store and you can only browse the web with Microsoft Edge.I didn't want to be limited and I began looking around for another solution eventually deciding on the Fusion5.Order the device through Amazon was simple and painless as most Amazon transactions are.  The device was shipped promptly and arrived when it was supposed to.I've been using the tablet for a few weeks now so I think I might be able to relay my experience with it.ScreenThe screen is great on par with other high end tablets.  The resolution of the 10.1" (diagonally measured) display makes for a nice crisp display with good color and brightness.Touch sensitive is good as well. I've had no problem with making selections for text fields buttons etc.  Some other folks have commented about a problem with selecting a text field and not having the on-screen keyboard pop up.  I don't think this is a failing of the tablet itself but rather the way Windows 10 works with touch. It's been an issue for the last several version of Windows and 10 is no different. Putting Windows 10 into  tablet mode alleviates the problem somewhat but in some text fields you may need to double tap.Using the Inking function in Edge OneNote and other apps worked flawlessly. Using a stylus or your finger you can highlight data on web pages or other places or even include short notes.The only complaint I would have about the display is the inclusion of a less than stellar screen protector with the device already installed. When  I received mine it was loose along the bottom bezel of the display. Further the protector slightly hindered use of touch features. Once I removed the protector touch sensitivity was much better. The downside if your remove the protector (and don't replace it) is the potential for scratches as well as the mass of fingerprints that will collect on the display.ConnectivityThe only option for connectivity include with the device is WiFi.  I've tested it by connecting to several different access points public and private and have had no issues.  The only downside I can mention is the lack of high speed options with the on-board WiFi. In my testing I was only able to connect with 802.11b which is limited to 11 Mbps so you're roughly getting 9.5-10 Mbps. I think a better option would be to use an 802.11 b/g/n chip for faster speeds.Even with the limited connectivity I am able stream NetFlix work on documents from OneDrive and surf the internet with no issues.  There is some slight buffering at the start of a NetFlix video but my desktop does the exact same thing so I don't see that as negative.  The rest of the stream is fine and displays in HD.  Streaming from YouTube was a bit better with a quicker start to viewing than with NetFlix.The device comes with a variety of ports on the side including a full size USB port mini HDMI USB-C and a power port.  Charging via the power port *or* USB-C worked fine. I wasn't able to test USB-C peripherals as I don't have any.Using the standard USB port I connected a wired mouse and it worked with no issue.  also tried a USB keyboard headset and game controller. All worked with problem. As long as Windows has or can find the correct driver for the device most should work with the tablet.One cool thing I was able to do is connect the tablet to my KVM switch. A KVM switch (with KVM being an abbreviation for "keyboard video and mouse") is a hardware device that allows a user to control multiple computers from one keyboard monitor and mouse.Using the KVM I was able to use my full size equipment at my desk. The device found the peripherals with no issues and I happily surfed the web and am actually writing this review using the tablet now using the big screen.  Document editing is much easier with full size equipment and the Fusion5 had no problems allowing me to use my regular gear.Bluetooth connectivity is good and I tried a couple of different devices with the Fusion5 including my phone a mouse and two different sets of headphones.  Range and functionality was good. Leaving the tablet in my home office I was able to move up to 50 feet away and the sound was still good in my headphones.SoundThe tablet included two speakers although they are not very good. At maximum volume the sound is *just* audible.  This doesn't bother me however as I use a bluetooth headset when I am streaming video using Skype etc.I haven't use the on-board microphone but I imagine you would be better served getting a good bluetooth headset for Skype calls or perhaps a wired headset connected to the USB port.StorageThe version of the device I purchased included 4 GB of RAM as well as 64 GB of storage on-board.While 4 GB of RAM won't give you enough "oomph" to run things like MySQL or Doom it is more than enough to edit documents in Word spreadsheets in Excel surf the net with multiple tabs open (but no too many!) and play some lighter games like Asphalt Airborne and the like.Mass storage of the device is a seemingly huge 64 GB. However keep in mind that Windows 10 takes a large chunk of this space for itself. The device does include an SD card slot with which you can use to expand the storage. With this in mind I did purchase a 128 GB SD card. I inserted the card and it worked straight away.The first thing I did is set my OneDrive folder to the new drive to keep things of the system drive. That way you're not cluttering up the system drive with your random cat pictures and crossword puzzles.Operating SystemThe Fusion5 comes with Windows 10 Home Edition 32-bit. This is not a watered down version of Windows nor is it Windows running in S mode. This is the full version of Windows 10 Home Edition.  What this means is that anything that you can run on your home machine you can run on your tablet provided that it fits in to the requirements of the software.For example I am a hobbyist software developer.  I write applications and utilities for use by people all over the world. On this device I was able to install and use a Win32 application that I built on my desktop machine. No errors no missing drivers. It just worked.Where all this leads is if there is something you want to connect to this tablet or some software you want to install the only questions you need to ask are "Is it compatible with Windows 10?" and "Does my hardware meet the requirements?"Battery LifeThe claimed battery life is around eight hours and I have no dispute with that.  I charge the device once per week and have yet to have an unexpected shutdown due to battery problems.  I imagine with some power management like dimming the display and throttling the CPU a bit (both available by tapping on the battery icon in the system tray) you could stretch it out to ten hours.SummaryI'm pretty happy with this purchase.  I use the Fusion5 for reading ebooks watching streaming video and some light web surfing. While it won't replace my desktop or my full laptop (it's a beast!) it is great for use on airplanes laying in bed at night riding the bus etc.Besides the few minor items I pointed out previously I would make one more ask for this device. The tablet includes no recovery media with it. It would be nice to have the option of performing a clean install of Windows 10 from media if the need arises.  As it sits I'm not sure it can be booted from USB but than may be an option provided I can find the product key.Overall if you are in the market for an inexpensive Windows 10 device I would recommend the Fusion5 10.1" Windows 10 tablet. At just under $200 it's a pretty great buy.
4,Bought this after my Surface 3 tablet failed on me after two months. I use this tablet exclusively to run my CAM software for my CNC machine. Set up was done in under 15 minutes and I was cutting again. Time will tell but as my headline says so far so good.
5,I use this as a mobile device for order entry control and browsing the web. Also embedded apps but windows app functionality. This allows me to use real Win apps not mobile apps. what a great device. would be nice if it had built-in bluetooth but you can add a bt dongle. decent price and works well. I am very satisfied with my purchase. I would recommend for anyone who needs full Windows functionality in a tablet form factor
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This is not like the Fusion5 tablet I bought some 3 years ago ( described as "Series ‎FWIN232+").This one has a Type-C port instead of a Micro-USB port.I bought this one in the hopes it would be exactly like the one I previously bought. I  asked on the Amazon site if it has a Micro-USB  or Type-C port and one reply stated that it has a Micro-USB port.Also this was advertised as Windows 10. The tablet is actually Windows 11.At this time I do not know if I will keep this tablet. I have  yet to use it. I am posting this review (within the same day I received the tablet) just because I was disappointed with the features and the fact that it is not Windows 10.I had already bought and returned this Fusion5 model of tablet to Walmart. (The Walmart site describes this tablet as "FWIN232+N4"). I then bought it through Amazon hoping it would be the Windows 10 Fusion5 tablet I  bought in 2019.  I clicked on the "Buy again" button.I do not know about the battery life or the touch screen or other things about it. I have yet to use it.I may return it.  But  I may not be able to find the "Series ‎FWIN232+."The problem with the Type-C  port is that  I  don't know if I can charge the tablet using the Type-C port instead of the barrel-pin port.I used to be able to use a regular common  Micro-USB cord to charge the older model and did not have to use the barrel pin receptacle. But even if I can charge the tablet with the Type-C port  I will need to get a type-C  cord  or I will need an adaptor to make Type-C into USB  and  it will be an inconvenience when I travel with the tablet because I will have to bring a Micro-USB  for my phone and a Type-C  and/or adaptor for the tablet.But again I may have to just keep this tablet and cope with it.One "pro" to it.The On/Off and Up-Down  buttons are designed so that they are "imbedded" in the frame of tablet (rather than sticking out of the frame of the tablet like the previous model) so that it is not as easy to accidentally press these buttons.I will have to update when I find out more about this tablet after I have tried it.
4,This tablet is pretty fast. I was able to load Norton VLC Player Firefox Kindle App System Mechanic and still have 28 GB free in my memory. The 4GB of RAM allows me to keep a few windows open at the same time. I am really loving the 3.0 std USB port and mini sd card with up to 128GB extra storage which allows me to download lots of movies and shows to watch later or I can watch shows from a usb stick drive through the USB port. So far the only con about this device is that the battery doesn't last very long so I need to keep it plugged in and the speaker is weak... (need to use earphones to get clear sound). I bought this in case my laptop goes out so I can stay connected and also to play videos off of a usb flash drive or micro sd card ( I used Kingston Canvas Select 128GB microSDHC Class 10 microSD Memory Card UHS-I 80MB/s R Flash Memory Card with Adapter (SDCS/128GB). Downloads are fast and the graphics are good.  I just received it today so I haven't had much time to play with it. So far I am pleased with my purchase and the price is great!  It would be nice to have an attachable keyboard for this tablet. I couldn't find one for this specific tablet. Hopefully Fusion5 will have one available soon. I rated this 4 stars instead of 5 because of the limited battery life and sound quality. UPDATE 10/16/18 :  My tablet stopped charging and when I clicked on the "Battery" icon on the Task Bar it said "Plugged in discharging" next to the % of battery left. This was NOT an issue with the tablet...It is a software issue with Windows 10 so if any of you have this problem DON'T return the tablet !  This is the fix for that :STEPS : To Fix "Plugged In discharging" - Windows 8/10 (Non Removable Battery)1 - Go to "Device Manager" (Rt Click Windows Logo on left bottom corner of screen - To Rt Click use Point & Hold method in "Gestures" section of the User Manual which came with this tablet - point and hold until box appears under your finger or pointer then release and a menu should pop up like when you Rt Click on your computer.) Select "Device Manager" in the pop-up menu.2 - Open "Batteries"3 - Rt Click "Microsoft AC Adapter" then click "Uninstall"4 - Rt Click "Microsoft ACPI-Compliant Control Method Battery" then click "Uninstall"5 - At top of Device Manager page click on "Action" then click on "Scan for Hardware Changes"6 - Go back to the list below and open "Batteries" again7 -  Rt Click "Microsoft AC Adapter"..... then click "Update Driver Software" ..... then click on  "Browse My Computer for Driver Software" .... then click on "Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my  computer" .... then click on "Microsoft AC Adapter" (make sure the box for Show Compatible Hardware is checked)8 - Rt Click "Microsoft ACPI-Compliant Control Method Battery"..... then click "Update Driver Software" ..... then click on  "Browse My Computer for Driver Software" .... then click on "Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my  computer" .... then click on "Microsoft ACPI-Compliant Control Method Battery" (make sure the box for Show  Compatible Hardware is checked) .... then close Device Manager9 - Click on Battery Icon on Task Bar to check charging status. The computer should now read that it is charging and it will no longer say  "Plugged in discharging"I hope this helps. PS: I still really like this tablet and will update if there are any problems. UPDATE 10/17/18 : Yesterday before I figured out this was a software issue I emailed Customer Service about the charging issue. I told them that I didn't know if this was a hardware or a software issue. Today when I checked my email I had received a prompt reply. This was the reply :From: F5CS LTD <ch14230-mohodkah@xsell.co>Sent: Wednesday October 17 2018 4:32 AMSubject: Re: Charger not workingHiThank you for your email update.Apologies for any inconvenience.However without any further delay we are sending you a replacement charger to rule out the issue.Please update us how you get along upon receipt of the new charger.We appreciate your patience and cooperation.RegardsMikeFusion5Fusion5 Customer Service is prompt and very accommodating. This company makes me feel supported in my choice to purchase this tablet.
5,NOTE: Pictures are of keyboard.  Was not included in initial purchase.05/23/2019 - The company sent me an offer for one of several items if I'd write a review - regardless of rating I'd get the item.  So I sent them my review.  Took a couple of tries because their email doesn't seem to like embedded pictures.  They got it after I attached the pics separately and I got the keyboard a few days later.Like the device the keyboard is an extremely good value.  I mean it would be even if it was like $30-$50 but since it was "free" it was outstanding.  :-)  Anyway the keyboard is very nice.  It's light and solidly made has all the functions one would expect and more.  It has a touchpad (which you can turn on/off with a function key) which also does pinch-zoom and two-finger scrolling.  The keys work well and are nicely space and there's even arrow keys.  No room for a 10-key of course.  The keyboard is part of a "cover" which is a soft-cover and I wondered why it didn't stick to the back until I realized it has "folds" built in which you can fold together to make the device stand up.  It's pretty clever really - I'll see if I can get a pic as it's hard to describe but basically it has magnets that if you stick them together the rest of it folds into a triangular shape giving you a "stand".Having used the device more since my initial review I'm even more impressed with it.  The battery is better than expected and even with a processor that's weaker than I'm used to (all my laptops have i7's) it still performs very well.  I've set it up several different ways reset and set up again with no problems.It doesn't appear to charge through the USB but I can live with that.  The charger is fine.Since it only has 64GB storage I put in a 128GB SD card and that too works fine.  As always the primary drive should be used for program installs (because it's faster) and the SD card for storage (and programs that don't need to load/access as quickly).  I don't know what the max card size is but 128GB is working fine for me.02/08/2019 - This tablet is pretty darn good for the price.  I wanted a cheap one so I could give Windows "as a tablet" a real try when I decided to replace my Android tablet.The good news is that it seems to work just fine for what it is.  What it is is a cheap Windows tablet.  It seems to work about as well as a weak i3 desktop would meaning it does everything but if you're used to a powerful machine this one may "feel" slow.  And of course you won't be able to run graphics-intensive games or open a dozen programs and expect them all to work well.  The battery life was pretty good.  And it threw to MiraCast just fine as well as accepting keyboards & mice.  I installed Office 365 and about 40 other apps and all ran okay including VPN a few games some other productivity programs etc.For me Windows as a casual "home" tablet simply doesn't work.  All too often I had to find the stylus to "click" on things and the majority of the apps are simply awful for home/casual use.  So after having this for a few weeks I bought a new Android tablet to replace the old one.  This does NOT constitute a failure on this tablet's side.  The tablet works as expected - like a PC.
5,Stored(4) 5 inch binders worth of manuals blue prints and other info all on my fusion 5. Very light weight which is good for when I'm going from location to location and need to know how they tie-in together. Highly recommend over a laptop especially when you don't always have a place to put it down.
5,I liked the price for the unit. The Fusion5 is just what I needed. I do wrench work on a very technical motorcycle. Most of my computers are Mac what I found is that the diagnostic tool requires having a PC to access all the options. The Fusion5 filled that need and with its size and weight easy to carry with me on long bike trips.
4,Product good fit as a consumer tablet.  We bundled on an industrial application as a user screen.  Working well.  No quality issues so far and working well for windows applications (browser settings camera apps) all good so far.  No slow downs or issues.
4,*edit 01/25/19*After exchanging emails about trying to get the touchscreen working/a fresh install image I was provided with a WinPE image. No problem I can work with that. However it actually doesn't contain what is needed to get the unit going. I will say that the offered support is very lackluster. I really haven't used the unit with the touchscreen not working sooooooooo meh. I guess the best advice is don't completely format and remove the recovery partition for space as Fusion5 won't provide much beyond that. I am not docking it any stars as it worked out of the box.This review is done with a unit that I did a fresh install of Windows 10 on Fusion5 does not have drivers readily available and I have not reached out to them yet to see if they are able to give drivers or an install image. The only things that I can't get to work without something from them is the touchscreen and the windows button on the screen. The drivers for everything are not easy at all to get together it's a big mix of locations to get from. The screen (what appears to be a Silead) seems to commonly be a problem to get working without help from the OEM. I can get it working but will not calibrate under any circumstances.I purchased this as I'm doing lots of traveling for work and wanted something casual to replace my laptop but something cheap as theft/damage possibilities are a bit higher. The cheap build I was able to make for this -Trapper keeper case: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00L5H2F3C/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1TeckNet mouse: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01EFAGMRA/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1Arteck keyboard: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00X5P8BJO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1Anker USB hub: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014ZOJX7W/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1ProCase bag: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01KICFTNC/ref=od_aui_detailpages00?ie=UTF8&psc=1The price of the unit protective case BT mouse BT keyboard USB 3.0 hub with network and carrying case for everything came in at about $280. I will be adding a slim BT controller for about $18 still keeping total price right around $300.This is not an overly powerful machine keep your expectations real. It is still amazing what it can do at this price point. Many reviews for the x5-Z8350 can be found online. Intel does list this as only supporting 2GB of RAM but this and other models in the family actually do recognize 4GB. Slowdown is pretty common when doing most things.-It does have a plastic screen protector already put on I took a picture where I peeled up a corner just to make sure. (It was perfectly fine until I messed with it.)-The power button is touched by the securing strap of the case but I feel this would be a common problem with almost any generic case. It doesn't exactly cause any problems unless the tablet is shifted around it detects it as a press on the button.-I have never seen it advertised but there is a GPS unit in this - a Broadcom 47521. I have not used it much but it does work.-Also never see it addressed: This comes with a separate AC adapter 5v 2.5a that plugs in right above the USB. My unit also charges through the micro USB port with a 5v 2a Samsung charger. It seems odd this would never be addressed as using an extremely common plug is much better than a very uncommon small barrel adapter.I have some strange random problems which I would love to try a new image to see if that's the issue. Again not readily available but I also haven't gotten around to reaching out to them about it.If you can be a realistic and patient user the value here is incredible. My main usage of this will be playing some older games. I would say it's similar to say a late 2011/early 2012 laptop with an i7-2670QM / Geforce 525m combo which was very popular back then.
5,I received this tablet just this past week and while I'm still investigating all the bells and whistles I have to say I'm very impressed and pleased with the product and its ease of use. When I purchased this tablet I was looking for something at a reasonable price that had more memory and storage space than the tablet I've had for three years and that came with a Windows operating system. I found both of my needs supplied with this tablet. The $199 price was great compared with other tablets some of which didn't match up to this one and it comes with a Windows operating system. This tablet as many assets:+ Physically the 10.1 inch LCD display screen is just the right size meaning it's not so small that it becomes difficult to work with and it's not so large that it can't be carried in a purse small bag or backpack. The screen is very clear and the colors are crisp. The shell is made of hard plastic which seems the style with just about all tablets so it's lightweight and easy to hold.+ According to the specifications the tablet comes with Intel Cherry Trail Z8350 Quad Core (up to 1.92GHz) 5.0 MP camera (front and rear views) 4 GB DDR RAM 64 GB storage Wi-Fi capability built-in Bluetooth capability 6000 mAh battery One Drive free online storage accepts up to a 128 GB micro card (not included) built-in G-Sensor (haven't figured that one out yet) and built-in hi-fi speaker and microphone. It also has a a USB port. USB cable and power cable are included.+ It comes with Windows 10 Home Edition pre-installed.The fact that it has a full-size 3.0 USB slot was a real plus when purchasing this tablet. That's one of the main things I missed with my other tablet as I had to purchase an adapter to use a flash drive and it was very slow. There is also a keyboard dock for an attachable keyboard which I wouldn't mind having but so far I've been unable to find one for this tablet.So far I've installed Firefox browser (the tablet comes with Edge browser) and several open source software programs (GIMP and OpenOffice) and even with Windows 10 installed I have almost 40 GB of free space for other programs. The tablet starts and runs quickly. Use of the Internet is very quick. I've had up to 10 tabs open at the same time and had no problems with internet speed. Wi-Fi works wonderfully. The graphics are nice and clear videos are crisp and the touch screen works very well. I'm still getting used to the on-screen keyboard it can be temperamental about where the user touches the keys and with what force. It doesn't seem as quick as on my other tablet or an Android but that might be because I'm not used to the feel of it yet. Sound is actually pretty good based on a few videos I've looked at and it comes through nice and clear with an earphone.I'm not sure about battery life. I normally use this in the evenings mostly writing surfing the web and doing research. When I turn it off after about 4 hours the battery still shows quite a bit of power remaining which means the battery lasts longer than in my other tablet which is a positive. I'll update in the future as to the battery capability. The battery does seem to recharge quickly.Based on what I've seen so far I'd recommend this product to anyone who's looking for a good tablet at an affordable price. It has a 12 month limited warranty included.
5,I'm using this Fusion5 tablet (Intel Celeron N4120 @1.1GHz 4GB RAM) to mostly view PDF files that I loaded on the microSD card. For this use it's great. My tablet has Windows 11 Pro installed on which was a surprise. Touchscreen is very responsive. My tablet came with a USB-C to USB 3.0 adapter so you can use 2 USB devices with type A connectors. I think the key to enjoying this tablet is to not expect much in the way processing power. I haven't tried video editing or any games but between the 4GB of RAM and 1.1GHz processor it's just not going to behave like an i7. Probably OK for email playing media files (played 1280x720 video using VLC just fine sorry no 1920x1080 vids on hand) etc But for me excellent deal for the price.
5,This tablet is perfect for our small business! It has just the right amount of features and is the perfect size! We are buying this tablet for the 6th time!
5,This is a great tablet with all of the Windows 10 features that are popular.  It's fast the graphics are clear and true color.  It has all of the bells and whistles that tablet users look for.  The only drawback is not the tablet itself but the lack of user instruction. For someone who has never owned a tablet there should be included a precise diagram of the external structure with clear instructions on powering up etc.  The User Manual is not easily available for download on the website either so for a beginner there is a learning curve.  I hope this will be remedied in the future by Fusion5.
5,I use this tablet in my electronics hobby workshop for programming Arduino microprocessors. It works well and has great battery life. I like the compact size for my work bench.
4,Found that this tablet was easy for use with people with vision problems.
5,Because I just returned my laptop and am waiting on components to build a PC I bought this Fusion 5 FWIN 232 Plus S1 tablet for use as a basic Windows 10 device. Overall I must say that it is excellent for the price. With 4 GB of RAM 64 GB of storage and a quad-core Atom processor this is by no means the fastest tablet. But for the price it would be hard to find something better (trust me I searched).Windows 10 works fine and the tablet will have no problem doing basic 1-2 tab web browsing word processing and even limited basic gaming (for example Minesweeper Among Us Roblox etc.). I would recommend exiting S mode on Windows 10 so you can install whatever programs you want.One thing I REALLY love about this tablet is the inclusion of a FULL SIZE USB 3.0 (renamed to USB 3.2 Gen 1) port. This makes transferring files connecting peripherals etc. SO MUCH EASIER. The micro USB port can also be used as a USB 2.0 port using the included micro USB to USB Type A female adapter. A micro SD card slot is included so you can expand your storage if the internal 64 GB is not enough. The mini HDMI (NOT micro HDMI) port will allow you to connect an external display (with the correct cable). I happened to already have a mini HDMI adapter lying around and was able to successfully connect an external display without any issues.This tablet has two options for charging--the included barrel charger or charging over micro USB. (A micro USB charging cable is even included!) I really like this flexibility as you can charge it from any standard power bank/USB port yet also have the option to use the barrel connector and have the micro USB port available.The screen is also fairly decent especially for the price. Despite what some might say 720p is adequate (although not the sharpest) for a 10 inch display. I do however like the dedicated Windows key button below the screen because I like to auto-hide the taskbar and this way I can easily make it appear.Concerning the cameras all I can say is that even the front camera looks better than the webcam on my recently returned $3000 laptop...One thing that I didn't care for though is that despite ordering it from the US the installed language was English (UK) and I had to download the US language pack. But this was very easy to fix.
5,Could not be happier with my purchase of the 4 gig 10 inch Fusion 5 tablet. I purchased this device with the intention of replacing a much more expensive laptop that is used for service call visits to customer sites. I regularly use laptops for IT services specific to high definition security video solutions. I have searched for a small form factor device with networking capabilities to use in servicing IP video cameras connected to enterprise networks. Until now a high-powered laptop with Ethernet port has always been required.I purchased the keyboard mouse portfolio device along with the tablet. The entire package is a very sleek and attractive option to carry and use daily.  I will agree with other reviews that the keyboard is less responsive than the wired option back at my office and the mouse pad leaves a little to be desired. I have found that a wireless mouse is easier for me to use when longer use sessions are required.  Regarding a quick email or a little web browsing the keyboard and mouse pad is just fine.The included power adapter does make me a little uncomfortable as I have never seen a power supply like it and doubt it would be easy to replace. I did however discover that the tablet will charge from the micro USB port on the side of the device.As a technical contractor the purchase of this device has eliminated a laptop bag as part of my daily carry items. I'm now able to slide my Fusion 5 tablet inside my tool bag and reduce the number of items I carry on to a job site to 1 bag as opposed to 2.  I've found that using the system inside my service vehicle is also very comfortable now. I'm able to quickly send an email from the front seat of my vehicle with all the desktop tools I would expect back in my office.Installation of Microsoft Office software suite went off without a hitch. I seem to have no trouble accessing my cloud based business applications. I am also able to run high definition video software applications used in my business. Virus software Microsoft updates and any other installation I have attempted so far have going off without a hitch.Storage is extremely limited in the device. My personal needs have all become cloud based over the past few years with the installation of a 128 gig SD card I have not reach a point yet that I needed more storage.You get what you pay for is certainly true in the realm of devices of this nature. That being said I certainly feel like the gamble placed when purchasing this device was a great success for my needs.*Note * I was so pleased with this purchase that I later purchased 11 inch Fusion 5 laptop with 2 gigs memory. I will see that the difference in memory between the laptop and the tablet are substantial. I do not believe the laptop with 2 gigs would meet my needs professionally for daily service call use. The tablet with 4 gigs of memory appears to be perfect. Hoping that Fusion 5 releases a 4 gig version of their laptop soon.
5,I use this tablet for streaming and as a backup for my laptop.
4,So far so good Windows 10 on a tablet screen. received on May 6th 2022.  been used every day without problem.  Screen is good quality good responsiveness. Hardware is fast enough for what is required of it have not tested it on gaming but basic computing is very quick.Excellent battery life so far have not had any issues. Well priced and well built.
4,This works really well for what I needed.
5,Love having a USB port
5,Great item and easy to use
4,Use it to play games
5,It performs well for the price range
4,An important disclaimer before I get started:  I've only had this product for about a week.  That said if anything changes in a few days/months/years I will be sure to update this review.  I hold no punches.After two bad experiences with Android tablets I decided to give Windows a shot after seeing how affordable this particular Amazon listing was.  A fully functional computer disguised as a tablet for only $200?  Sign me up!  I wasn't expecting a mind blowing machine but I needed something that could at least handle web browsing movie streaming and the occasional week long Candy Crush binge.  Honestly?  So far so good.Pros:-  I've never known a device to boot up so quickly.  This seem trivial but trust me you'll appreciate it.-  Did I mention it's a fully functional computer in tablet form?  No more browsing from mobile websites or having to save certain tasks for when you can get on your laptop or desktop computer.  Attach a keyboard to this baby and you're good to go.  Though it probably wouldn't handle Photoshop or any serious gaming very well it's great for everything else.-  Not lightening fast but also not a dud.  For $200 I'd expect this thing to be pretty slow but it's not.  I get to where I'm going quick with little to no issues.-  Mine came with a pre-installed screen protector.  It's just one of those flimsy plastic protectors but it saved me from having to run out purchase and install my own.  I really appreciated that!Cons-  Very limited app store.  For somebody using this mainly as a tablet I was hoping I'd be able to download some decent apps.  Not the case.  Because Windows considers this a full computer you're only able to download apps that are available for computers.  To download Discord I had to download the desktop version which is very clunky and at times slow on this device.-  Yes sometimes it lags and even freezes.  I wouldn't consider this a major issue because the lags or freezing issues normally last under thirty seconds but still a point worth mentioning.  Again this is a $200 tablet computer and these issues are (so far) far and few between.So would I recommend giving this tablet a shot?  Definitely.  If your needs are similar to mine I think you'll be happy with your purchase.
4,I bought this Fusion5 tablet to operate a laser engraver in my woodshop. I create images on software on my PC then transfer them to the Fusion5 (via USB stick or WiFi) and then run the engravings. For the most part it's been good. The Fusion5 locked up on me once which took a few minutes to get it restarted and it's a bit on the slow side but again it does exactly what I need it to do and I'm happy with the purchase for the price paid.
5,Good tablet
3,I purchased this for travel and to handle some diagnostic software. My laptop was just too cumbersome for these applications. It arrived in one piece. Had the usual wait for windows to update everything. I punched all the buttons tried all the ports etc and everything worked. I cleaned out the apps I didn't need to free up space.Touch screen is responsive. Color is good. Video quality is top notch. As noted elsewhere the audio is dismal but you would expect that from something small. You will want to use earbuds for reasonable  enjoyment.  I do think some more ram would be a great improvement. I will probably have to use the SD card option once everything is loaded up.I think the camera is easier to use than the one on my phone. All in all a full featured notepad on a budget.Edit: 3 months have gone by and I have issues.1: I have successfully paired up several different ear phones and buds and have yet to get the bluetooth audio to work with anything. The computer sees the buds and the buds see the computer but no sound happens.What's up with that?2: The screen marks and scratches up easily. It's going to look like crap in a year. Needs real glass.Reduced stars to 3. Probably should be one due to the lack of bluetooth audio.
5,I purchased the Fusion5 Windows 10 tablet to take with me on vacations providing me with a place to store/edit my photos. So far (3 weeks in) I'm very impressed.I purchased the 4gb/64gb version of the Fusion5 tablet. I replaced an Android Tablet (Galaxy S Tab 2) with this Fusion5. I'm an old-style Windows person and could never get used to the Android apps for handling photos.The first thing I did was to move from Windows 10-S to Windows 10 to allow me to load software from sources other than the Microsoft Store. The procedure to do this can be found on the web. This process was easy and painless.I purchased and installed a Samsung 256gb EVO Select micro sdxc card.I then began to install my software packages loading all (except Photoshop CS5) to the Samsung card (for some reason Photoshop CS5 must be loaded to the C drive). In all I loaded Photoshop CS5 Office 2016 Thumbsplus Kindle Malaware Bytes Chrome and Adobe DNG converter to the tablet.After doing the software loads I have the following free space on my C and D (Samsung Evo) drives:C: used 36.2 gb / Free 20.6 gb (yea I know doesn't add up to 64gb)D: used 2.42 gb / Free 236 gb (also doesn't add up to 256gb)All of the applications that I loaded run fine. Photoshop is a bit slow but will work for vacation mode.I didn't purchase an external keyboard but did pin the OSK (on-screen-keyboard) to the taskbar. I coupled a bluetooth mouse to the tablet and am able to navigate Chrome Office Photoshop and Thumbsplus easily.Battery life seems to be very good around 6-7 hours. I downloaded Battery Bar (free) to monitor the battery.I will soon be taking the Fusion5 down to the Amazon for two weeks and plan on loading the Samsung Evo with pictures. Will do some minor edits in Photoshop to tweak pictures while I'm there to make sure that I'm using the proper camera settings for the environment.In all so far this is a five-star investment.Update:  I purchased the Jelly Comb foldable keyboard to avoid having to key with the onscreen keyboard. Enhances the entire experience.  Very glad I got both.
5,I have been using the Fusion5 tablet for a couple of weeks and now feel comfortable writing a review.I needed a tablet to enable me to take online piano lessons (Skoove).  Skoove runs on Windows and Mac tablets not Android.  That limited my search to Windows tablets because of cost and the fact that I am familiar with Windows.  I needed the tablet to have a full size USB port to enable me to connect the tablet to our electric piano with an a/b cable.  It needed WiFi to run the online Skoove app.  And it needed Bluetooth to connect the tablet to the piano's speaker system.The Fusion5 FWIN232 Plus tablet met all of those requirements.  I had read several very negative reviews (and many more good ones) and decided to give the Fusion5 a try since the price was so good.So far I've been very satisfied.  It has performed as I hoped.  The screen image is quite good.  The touch screen works without issues even with the factory installed protector in place.  (Some owners had asked about removing the second protector.)  The battery seems to be working well.  I have not used the micro USB port so I cannot comment on it.  The tablet speaker however is disappointing as other reviewers wrote.  Maybe it would be adequate for voice apps or programs like Cortana but probably not for music or movies.Initially I did have trouble connecting the piano and the tablet with Bluetooth.  To my surprise and delight this problem was resolved with a Windows update.  Incidentally the tablet has been through two or three Windows updates with no problems.  The tablet comes with Windows 10 S installed.  It is an easy and free process to change from 10 S to 10 Home if you choose.I did have a question about support.  I was advised that I could contact Fusion5 or LSElectronics by email for assistance.  To my knowledge there is no phone or chat contact available.Again I have used the tablet for only a couple of weeks but anticipate its continuing to run well.
5,After suffering with a iPad for too long so I started looking for a new tablet. I knew I didn't want Android due to the many ads pop ups and dynamic menus that are always making changes trying to anticipate what would be helpful. They never get it right.It had to be Windows. The MS Surface was twice the price of the fusion 5. I was concerned it would be a mistake to save the money.I really like the Fusion!  It is Windows Home addition I wish it was Pro but it is the same folder and file system I know. It is good to once again have cursor and tab keys. I like being able to have multiple apps open and copy between them without losing my work in the process of switching apps.The performance is great. I have downloaded a Satellite tracking program (PCSAT32) and a Antenna design program (4NEC2). They both downloaded and installed as if the Fusion 5 was my desk top PC.  Both have 3D graphics and are math intensive. PCSAT32 runs the same as on the PC. 4NEC2 runs full speed with a simple design. A complex design that takes 20sec to analyze on the PC takes just over 2 minutes on the Fusion5. (the PC is a serious work station).  The third program is WSJT-X which decodes digital communication signals. It runs without any problems and is also math intensive. Other programs like Adobe and Zoom work fine.CONS- I agree with the reviews that are critcal of the sound and speakers. Turned all of the way up the volume through the speakers is barely adequate in a fairly quiet room.- During the inital setup you are forced to create a Microsoft account for cloud computing and storage. They tell you how to uninstall it and revert to local use during setup which I did without problem. A "skip" option would be nice but then they wouldn't get to collect personal your information.- When running processor intensive apps the battery will only last at most 4 hours.
4,Great tablet ! I use it to run a Shapeoko CNC machine and check email . Has many more capabilities though.Screen has good graphics for my use .UI has little lag compared to other tablets of this price range.
5,We purchased the Fusion 5 tablet because it looked like it would be better than a typical computer in a dusty smokie workshop.It is a touch slower than a typical computer but that is perfectly fine because it has no cooling fan to draw dust and smoke into the electronics inside thus causing shorts and the like.Due to the Fusion 5 tablet size we were able to  take it one step further and put it into a clear plastic freezer bag with an air supply connected to a fish tank air bubbler. It now gets outside fresh air all because of the small size and the ability to have a blue tooth keyboard.We have every confidence that the Fusion 5 tablet will fill our need for several years running our equipment in the workshop and hope that it has a long supply life a-head as I can see us purchasing more of them.
5,I use this tablet to run SDR# for a Software Defined Radio (SDR).  It works great for this.  I don't use it for much else other than running Windows updates!
3,I still think this is the best tablet in this price range.  I ordered the 4 GB version with 64 GB internal storage.  I can't imagine the 2 GB version runs well.  Even with 4 GB mine is using about 65% of it just from the operating system.  You have to remember this is a tablet not a laptop.  This uses an Intel Atom processor and has very little storage.  Don't bog it down with memory hungry programs or it will run like garbage.  It runs pretty well if you follow this rule.  Having a Windows tablet with a USB port makes this machine very capable.Now to the reason I deducted a few stars.  There is a bug somewhere in either the hardware or software (possibly driver issue) which causes this machine not to wake up from sleep.  The only option is to force a restart by holding the power button for about 15 seconds.  I remedied this by disabling sleep in Windows.  This isn't ideal when on battery power but it suffices when powered.The other issue I have is that the company does not and will not provide the necessary drivers for download.  Even if you email them they will refuse but offer to fix the machine for a cost (usually more than the tablet cost in the first place).  I've not experienced this personally but I've read about the issue from other people who have publicized their interactions with the company.  So if the operating system gets corrupt from a bad update or some other issue you are completely SOL even if you can do a reinstall yourself.  That's just poor service.  I've never seen a hardware company not provide Windows drivers and I guess the motive behind this is $$$.  It also means that an update to whatever driver is currently causing the not-waking-from-sleep issue will never be released by them.This is a capable tablet as long as you realize it's limitations.  The company doesn't support the device after the warranty period is up and you will have no option to download the drivers from them.  This can make this buy somewhat of a risk but if you can get around that it's a decent tablet.
4,Handy little device.  I use it for the shop loaded some automotive diagnostic software and connect via USB to a pass thru device to reset codes etc.  Also use it to connect to bluetooth speakers for playing music.  Works fine for what it is a little slow sometimes but usually not enough to be a bother probably power saving related.Touch screen is decent could be a little more sensitive and a little bit bigger.  I got the 10" but maybe should have found a 12" so I can work it a little easier with my fat fingers.One thing that I really like is that it can be charged thru a micro USB but it also has a separate AC charger with a tiny barrel connector.  Was connected with the USB and still able to drain the battery down playing games or something haven't tried with the AC adapter also haven't tried plugging them both in at the same time...So far so good no complaints everything seems to be working well.  My original plan was to remove everything I could to clean it up and just use it for the diagnostic software but since it is working ok I've added a few apps for other stuff.  Probably get a keyboard for it and then see how it works for a mobile arduino programmer.It has a wide (3/4" or so) black border around the screen but screen is actually 10" diagonal so it is as advertised.  I kind of like the border because it gives me something to hang on to when carrying it around.If you want a basic windows tablet this one seems like a good choice.
5,I have two other tablets but they haven't worked well for what I needed them for. I found this one and liked the reviews on it. I wanted to use it for my music and the other tablets just didn't work out for me. When I saw this was a "windows" tablet I figured I'd try it out. It works perfect! I am used to using windows explorer and with this tablet I can access that. I have all my music on Dropbox and with this tablet I can access them and see them easier than with any of the other methods I tried before. My only problem is it sometimes takes me four or five clicks to open one of my documents (songs). Not sure why this happens but it IS annoying especially when you're in a hurry which I usually am to get a song loaded and get to playing it! Other than that I do LOVE this tablet. I can't speak on the battery life as I use it plugged in. The reason for that is that the screen goes blank on me too soon on battery mode and that's inconvenient when I'm in the middle of a song. I don't know anything about gaming either. This is a good reliable tablet for what I need it for. If you need more power to play games I can't help you. For surfing email or anything that doesn't require massive power you can't go wrong with this tablet.
4,I purchased this as a replacement for my ASUS Tablet/PC also running Windows 10.  I never liked the iPad I bought a few years ago as I like the feel of a laptop.  I wanted something fairly inexpensive to use while I watch TV but have those questions that must be answered immediately - i.e. a quick device aside from my cell phone.  My ASUS had a docking keyboard making it more like a laptop - and after using the Fusion5 4/64 for a couple of days I opted to buy the keyboard as well.  It is light amazingly quick and easy to use with Windows 10.  I am not impressed with the speakers - but - hey - I didn't buy this for great audio.  My Bose headphones (non bluetooth) work great - and I am trying to get the Fusion5 to play on my wireless Bose Soundsport earphones.  No luck yet - but I will keep trying.  Using the plug-in headphones I tried Netflix streaming and it worked without a glitch - until I paused the show and went to back to it a few minutes later when I saw it was a bit glitchy.  So a quick restart of Netflix and all was fine.  Again - I am not expecting perfection - I only wanted a device that would enable quick information / purchases / e-mail checking without going to my desktop in another room.  I did see that Office Online is available (and seems to be for free) - so that will be my next download.  All in all - a nice light quick tablet/laptop.  Looking forward to receiving my docking keyboard to make this even easier to handle.  Go Fusion5 !
2,The product says windows 10 but I was shipped a windows 11 product. The whole reason I bought this product was because it was windows 10 and I'm avoiding windows 11 like the plague. Having read many reviews and now using this product I feel completely justified in that. I'm really disappointed I got a bait and switch OS. Also after conducting regular windows updates I now can't unlock the tablet without doing a factory reset which means I have to do the whole set up over again. Don't bother with the attachable keyboard - it's too small to be usable. Get a Bluetooth one separately.All in all I'd say if this tablet ran on windows 10 I'd give it 4 stars. But windows 11 sucks and I'm annoyed I have to do a factory reset after less than 24 hours.
5,Plug and play tablet with no issues. Fully compatible with everything I need to use it for and simple for the kids to use as well. Great value buy!
3,This is advertised here as a Windows 10 unit but it is already uploaded to Windows 11. That may not matter to some unless the program or app does not run in 11 as in my case. I returned it.
4,I bought this to be my travel assistant away from any internet connection. That put my Chrome book at risk plus I did not want to learn all about using offline Chrome to do the tasks I have been doing in Windows for years. I'll be taking it into the jungles of northeastern Brazil and using it to back up and do some basic editing of photos and record a daily diary/blog and update my birding list. I bought the Arteck HB030B Bluetooth keyboard and a USB hub both of which function with this tablet.I encountered two problems setting it up. First without a hard-wired keyboard (my choice) you have to use the on-screen keyboard to get through the setup procedure. What a mess. The keyboard obscures the fields you are filling in which is inconvenient enough. Do remember to remove the protective plastic shield or the touch screen will work poorly - that was my fault. I thought it was the 'permanent' screen protector which it is not. Next you must open or establish a Microsoft account and for some reason MS would not accept my passwords. Resetting them requires a second computer or cell phone. So be patient. Once the setup was done everything worked well. I have not tested the minimalist photo editing program yet (paint.net) so can't say if the CPU is up to the task but other programs load and work fast enough.Software installed for travel: Open Source Live Writer SyncBack paint.net Firefox Faststone Image viewer (all free programs). Hardware: Logitech wireless mouse (owned it for years) USB hub Arteck Bluetooth keyboard.4 out of 5 stars rated because 5 stars is perfect. Too soon to tell.
4,It works very well with the Shapeoko and I like that it is sealed.
3,The Good: A full Windows 10 system on a portable tablet that has a USB port and slot for a Micro SD to expand storage.The Neutral: Its operating on a lower end processor so not something you want to use for much beyond the lightest of task and/or entertainment.The Bad: The sound system. Invest in a bluetooth speaker if you don't intend to exclusively use this with earphones.I mainly got this device to play my lighter steam games (visual novels) from the comfort of my sofa and bed without having to purchase a much more expensive Steam Deck. To that end its been pretty serviceable. It's very nice to be to play some games away from PC on a bigger screen (compare to my phone) and without using steamplay. Its also been nice for other simple activities like streaming shows and reading webnovels.
5,My windows (FUSION) tablet PC is exactly what I was looking for. Easy to get around handles video fine.battery life very good. I will be getting another.
5,I was looking for a tablet  computer was considering an iPad or an android 7" to 10". I ran across this Fusion % 10' windows computer. It is very affordable but I was concerned about the low Ram and the small SD drive. However I use it for my rather sophisticated Bible research Bible program that I use in conjunction with Microsoft Word. It works beautifully and flawlessly. I can take my computer in a case I  bought for it right into the pulpit access the Bible and my sermon nots at the same time.  I am impressed and greatly pleased.
3,If you don't care about how loud your videos will play so this review is not for you. I got this tablet for my aunt that she used to have an older Microsoft Surface that died after 6 years of service!. She immediately complained that the sound quality is very bad in comparison with what she used to have before. The device has a tiny speaker at one side of it and I witnessed that my Note 9 phone is much louder than this tablet. That was a show stopper  and I have to return the tablet at this point even though I spent a whole day earlier updating Windows (it was a pain) and changing all the UK settings and default keyboard to the US ones.I can't talk about battery life since I had it connected to the charger all time that I had it in a hope to boost performance during the Windows updates. Other than that the whole thing was OK it seemed cheap for example when I tired to connect the power cord into the tablet at first it did not fit!! and when I looked carefully I found the plastic edge of the tablet was partially covering this socket I had to push it back to go to its original position to uncover the power socket (maybe it was moved from shipping?!!). You might want to spend more money and get a better quality tablet.
3,We use this device as a simple tablet to fulfill a specific set of tasks.  It is priced correctly for this purpose.
4,I am still familiarizing myself with this product but I think it is exactly what I need!  I am using it for quilting automation.  Installing my software was quick easy.  The touch screen has a nice response time.  I hope to upgrade to a 5 star after I have used this more.
5,I have a nice gaming computer at home with a 1300 watt power supplythat is a little expensive to keep on all day now that I'm staying home due to the virusSo I was interested in getting something that I could just browse the internet and do somework with Excel and Word.So far this little thing has been working great. I can do everything I need to so farand with OneDrive both computers and kept updated.A few comments about the TabletBoots up pretty quick and programs are quick to come up alsoDon't use a docking keyboard. I got use to the on screen one pretty quick.I use a wireless mouse so navigating is very easy for me.I didn't have any trouble connecting to my WiFi never disconnected me yetIt connects 2.4GHZ would be nice to connect at 5.0GHZ...Full size USB is very useful so far very nice featureBattery life has been good about 7 hrs surfing and watching short videosScreen is very clear for being 1280x900I bought the 4GB / 64GB version and loaded  ms office and 4 programs on itand still half about 1/2 of the hard drive space left.Haven't used the cameras yet so can't comment on them.Changed out of S mode very easy to do.Speakers.. Yeah not so great but it's a Tablet but good enough to hear so videosOnly downside so far is. I bought the UAG Exoskeleton 10-Inch Universal Case and the top Left rubber holdercovers up the On/Off button. Just had to cut a little rubber off of it. I know not Fusions fault.So far very happy with it really don't have any negative things to say about it.
4,Bought this for my husband to use with his CNC. After troubleshooting a couple of initial issues everything seems to be working well. Really like that there is a USB port. There was one issue with the tablet not turning on for a few minutes but we’re hoping that was an issue with the charger and not the tablet itself. Overall so far so good. Would recommend for people who need something portable but with the abilities of a PC.
5,I've purchased a few tablets in the past few years and this one is head and shoulders above the ones I've tried. Came preloaded with Windows 10 pro touch screen is responsive good connectivity to the web and easily adapts to a number of peripherals with a number of IO ports. I LOVE this tablet
4,the tablet is great and works well but it is very slow comparatively. which that is to be expected but it is something important to know. overall though it is great for note taking and streaming.
5,Exactly what I needed for the intended purpose
4,I bought this 10" Win10 FUSION5 tablet computer and an iPad 9.7" at the same time. I needed something like this for work. I am used to Windows and really dig Windows 10. I had never really used an Apple product before.I compare these because they are in the same price range (FUSION5 about $50 less) and have approximately the same screen size.The FUSION5 tablet runs very well. It has 64 GB storage (don't ever buy a Windows tablet with only 32 GB!!) and 4GB RAM. It (CPU) is pretty fast though not as fast as the iPad (which though has only 1/2 the RAM as the FUSION5).I really like both products. The iPad is very slick refined and fast. The FUSION5 while a bit more sluggish (cause: slower CPU and we are running the FULL version of Windows 10 after all!) holds its own well. AS A BONUS the FUSION5 also has USB port and you can extend the storage by 256 GB (SD card). The iPad has neither.Bottom line: I really like the iPad and find myself using it a lot for casual things. But for work and any real productivity - and for the best compatibility with various applications - Windows is still tops and this FUSION5 tablet computer is really a wonderful device. My only complaint really is that it has a proprietary adapter (as does iPad) which leads to yet more clutter. For the ~$199 I paid for this device I am very happy.
5,The tablet was great as far as what it did and how it did it. The problem us with their service department. I got the detachable keyboard for it. The keyboard failed because it started to detach from its backing board. I contacted their service department in late September about it. The only way you can converse with them is email. There are no phone numbers or customer service web pages to communicate through. I explained the precise issue. The separation of case and back board and that 1/2 the keyboard wasn't working. I was actually asked if I thought it was the keyboard. I responded that I was sure because the Unicorn sitting in the corner couldn't be the cause. The keyboard was physically coming apart. What else could it have been. They said they would look into it. One month later (30 days) I was notified they would send me a replacement. 30 days later still no replacement keyboard. I sent another email and they said my bad I forgot to put it in the mail. A new one would be in the mail that night. 30 days later again no keyboard. I sent yet again another email. 5 days later I received a return email stating they had failed correcting my issue 3 times so they would by contacting their Team America service department to correct the issue. Shouldn't they have done that the first time? Really how hard is it to pick up a phone and have the department head personally look into an unacceptable issue. It's now 3 1/2 months since this farce began. Do not buy their products because if the obvious total disconnect between their sales department and their service department.
3,The weak switch and poor charging rate
2,The tablet is very nice for the money. It works just fine.The tablet was purchased July 12th of 2022. It now shuts down after 10 minutes of use with out any warning.I have contacted the manufacturer waiting on a response.Will kjeep this updated.Thank you.As of today Sept. 24 2022 it will not power on completely dead.I have contacted the manufacturer. They responded with asking for order ID # from amazon purchase. Will keep updating.
4,I’m going through and updating my reviews and I feel this one needs a bit of detail. I bought this as a on the go windows device with the intention of using it to fill out applications take notes and help with schoolwork and do some casual gaming. It was the only windows 10 experience I could afford that I figured would be better than others at its price range. It wasn’t the fastest snappiest but it does have 4gb ram so it was much faster than it’s 2gb counterparts. A128gb SD was more than enough to hold files in addition to the 64gb onboard. I couldn’t afford the folio keyboard case to go along with it but I did get a Logitech wireless mouse and keyboard combo that pair on a single dongle coupled with a switchable 3.0 usb hub with individual power buttons to put some flash drives and what not. It preformed well enough to play games from the windows store pretty good I wouldn’t drop frames too often unless the game was an mmo or intense FPS. Browsing was easy though the touch screen can be difficult due to size of icons and letters but a mouse and kB help and more so if you take advantage of the mini HDMI port for bigger screen connectivity or external screen use it’s pretty nice. Fast forward 3 years I don’t use it much as I used to but it still works fine. Would I buy it in 2021? On sale maybe or if you need to use windows but don’t want a straight up potato this is fine
5,I bought this tablet (4GB RAM 64 GB storage) as an iPad replacement for my nonagenarian mother: when using her tablet she needs some hand holding and iPads and Android tablets do not allow remote control without jumping through a lot of hoops. My first impressions of this tablet are pretty good. The screen is bright and crisp its relatively low resolution (by tablet standards) notwithstanding. I switched Windows out of its S mode and painlessly if slowly upgraded it to version 1909 and installed/configured basic tablet applications mostly for communications media playback and ebook reading. I also configured remote control and tested it. Everything works fine both in desktop and in tablet mode. I plan to set it up in the tablet mode before delivering it to my mother.Now a list of things that are less than ideal. (1) The charger. All mainstream tablets these days use a USB connector and charger. I don't know if it's a limitation of Windows or of this particular tablet but it requires (and includes) a separate charger. Not a big deal but if you travel you have to carry an extra piece in addition to your phone charger. And if you lose it you'll be in trouble. (2) Switching between applications is a little sluggish. This is likely a limitation imposed by Atom CPU not by the amount of RAM. (3) Sound quality using built-in speakers is mediocre so is image quality of the front-facing camera.Altogether I find the above issues minor the tablet suits its purpose for me and given its price which is less than half of MS Surface Go it's a pretty good value!
4,This works great. It's no speed demon but if you give it a second to load it runs very smoothly. I purchased it to run Google Earth Pro from a tablet and it does that no problem even runs Remote Desktop smoothly. Physically it has a very good heft to it. Sturdy doesn't flex or bend when held on a corner. Also love that it has a USB 3.0. My wireless mouse isn't bluetooth so I'm still able to pop that in if I need a mouse.I gave a point off on the battery because of the charge time. I haven't tried through the micro-usb but from the DC charger they provide it can take 8-10 hours to fully charge. Also the DC plug is tiny and I'm worried it might break if I'm not careful with it. Despite that it does seem like the battery lasts a long time. I'm running Netflix on "full power" mode and it's at 81% after 1.5 hours. If you're going to be using it for audio/video a lot I recommend headphones or a speaker. The built-in speakers are tiny and if there's any background noise at all it's difficult to hear at full volume.I wouldn't suggest it as a primary work machine but for general use or a solid work back-up it's definitely worth a shot.
5,I was in need of a replacement tablet  but wanted a Windows 10 version instead of Android that I've had for years.  Saw the recommendations for the Fusion 5 FWIN 232+ tablet and decided to take a chance.  So far so good.  The setup took a little time to get through  my only minor complaint would be that the tablet I got was set up for UK and not US even though the box was marked for US.  Not a big deal to change things in the settings.The battery life has been remarkably good  videos have been very clear  and the sound output is more than adequate for this tablet.  The 64GB of disk space should be fine  but I ordered a 128gb Micro -SD card for extra storage should the need arise.  I would like to get a screen protector for it but not sure what will work with this tablet.  I did see one Amazon product  but it was not available.  A minor issue for now but I'm sure I'll figure something out.
5,This tablet is pretty nice for the price it's not setting any speed records but its cheap. I'm using it as a controller for my CNC router works great for that. Wifi is fine is able to pick up the signal from inside my detatched garage. Tablet comes in S mode you'll want to go to the Microsoft store and search "s mode" and something like "switch out of s mode will come up". S mode makes it so the only apps you can download MUST come from the MS Store. If that is what you want cool if not proceed with switch out of S mode.Comes nicely packaged a surprise for an entry level Windows tab. It comes with a few extra connectors as well. The touch screen is very accurate i thought with double tapping to click apps etc it would be an issue but its great.The only thing that's a slight negative- the screen is a fingerprint magnet and also appears to be prone to scratches definitely grab a screen protector.Otherwise fine tablet for the price.
4,Not a gaming computer but after switching to full Windows mode it runs my CNC router well.
5,Received as a gift replacement for a tired android tablet.  Was very used to android so not initially enthused with this item.  However I have a win10 desktop at home and at my office.  I found this easy to adapt to.  My initial dislike over the lack of apps available abated as I realized I didn't need them as everything is very doable through the win10 edge web browser making most apps really unnecessary.  The tablet is quick to turn on open and become functional and installs the win10 updates flawlessly.  Also the Win10-S version installed offers increased malware protection by preventing apps from other than the windows store from being installed.  I saw this as a negative at first but since the -S mode of win10 can be removed I now see this as a positive and have retained -S mode.  My android tablet is fully retired factory reset and passed on to its next owner as I am very happy and fully satisfied with my Fusion win10 tablet.  I have found battery life to be very good for my uses charging overnight every 2 to 3 days.  Only negative I have is that the glare from overhead lights off the screen can be annoying and there are very few protective covers cases or sleeves available.  But these are minor annoyances titling the screen helps and I did find a cover.  This is a great win10 tablet for the price.
4,We use this tablet as the main computer for our hotel keys. It does it's job. It's definately not an iPad or a Surface Pro but it will do the job you ask of it!
4,I bought this tablet because it was a Windows tablet that's easily controlled through Microsoft's parental apps. It's been working as it should and I like its portability. So far it has been useful for what it was bought for that is homework and basic browsing and movie watching.
4,Everything about it was just as I expected.  The price was reasonable and it came well packaged.  The only problems I have had were that it was a bit finicky with the log in screen for a time where it did not give me the pop up keyboard for logging in. Also  after I did all the windows updates it took a couple restarts before it would link up with our router again.  It will only be used with a mechanic's diagnostic tool so I think that now we are past those issues everything should be fine unless they crop up again.  I have had it less than a week we'll have to wait and see.
4,Battery seemed bad but after a few charges it works just fine great little machine
5,This product is amazing!  It is fast to load and operate and it's colors are vivid and vibrant.  Also it has a neat way of projecting sound.  If you hold it sideways with your hands on the bottom sides your hands act like a stereo head set. I couldn't ask for a better product.  Wow!
5,This tablet is great. I was looking to replace my old Windows tablet that quit. I didn't realize how difficult it is to find a reasonably priced Windows tablet. I prefer the Windows operating system as is my laptop. I found this tablet but I never heard of the brand so I debated on it for a while. I'm glad I finally decided to give it a try. This Fusion tablet has a 10' screen quite a bit of memory and is fast. I'm able to do multiple things without any issues. It plays videos really well. I don't know about the speaker's sound quality (they do work) but I always use headphones. The only issue I have noticed is depending on your settings the battery can drain pretty quickly. Also this tablet has a full-size USB port my old tablet didn't have that. They give you a power cord a micro USB cable and a micro USB to USB cable. All and all the tablet works better than I expected and I'm very happy with it. I highly recommend it.
4,When I turn on the computer I had a hard time getting the touch screen to respond to my touch and display the sign-in screen.  I have resorted to attaching a mouse cause the computer to display the sign-in screen.  Other than this I am very satisfied with this tablet.  I have the functions of a PC in my hand with the help of a soft mouse and keyboard.4/2020Still going strong.  I still use a USB mouse to open the sign-on screen.  I use a soft keyboard and mouse once I get started.  It's one of my life's essential tools and I use it nearly every day.3/2021Whew! I thought I had lost her.  I couldn't get any response even pushing the reset+volume-up for 15 seconds.  But I took her away from the cold window and charged her some more and she rebooted.  Hooray.  I'm back in business.10/2021I use it now with a remote PC and NoMachine.  Runs fine.
5,I needed another computer for my studio upstairs with Windows 10 that is at least as powerful as the PC I use downstairs with at least as much storage and was planning on connecting it to my Samsung 32" Curved 1920x1080 HDMI 60hz 4ms FHD LCD Monitor. It so happened that was going on a Christmas vacation and also wanted to take a computer with me.  I thought maybe I should just get a nice 17 inch laptop so I could take it with me and just forget about hooking it up to my big screen because 17 inches of screen is satisfactory for the work I do. I wanted a big screen but after looking at those 17 inchers I realized that I didn't want to lug such a monster with me through airports and such. I started to consider tablets. After some careful shopping I found the 10" Windows 10 Fusion5 Ultra Slim Windows Tablet PC with 4GB RAM 64GB Storage. It was much more reasonably priced than what I'd been looking at before and it has as much RAM and more memory than the PC I have only much smaller... a perfect size to travel with. I bought this took it on my vacation and when I got home I took it upstairs and hooked it up to my 32 inch screen. What a great fit for me! I am very happy with it.
5,When the battery on my iPad died I was more than ready to search for an Android alternative.  I never warmed up to Apple's iOS.  I was not familiar with Fusion 5 but was impressed by the reviews and the modest price.  I live very rural and rely on a hotspot for internet so was happy to see that this tablet would work with the hotspot.  I took a chance and was glad I did.  The set-up was very straight forward including the link to the hotspot.  This tablet communicated with my wireless printer much more easily than the iPad.  It also works well with the Logitech wireless keyboard that I already had.  The screen quality is excellent.  The sound quality as others have noted is only OK but that is not important to me.  I have not tried ear buds yet but feel confident that they would help.  Overall this is an outstanding value that leads me to wonder why other brands charge as much as they do.
3,Operated without any problems for 6 weeks.  Then the network card stopped working.  Device Manager did not have a network card listed.  After 2 factory resets the network card started working again.  Returned for refund
4,I bought this device a daily driver on-the-go. While everything works great the battery life is pretty short (about 3 hours under normal use and about 10 hours in sleep mode). It comes with HDMI and USB ports on the side and can be docked. It's pretty good for a tablet!
4,I bought this for emailing and movies/music on the go and it has been a great experience. It works fast has a good touchscreen and easily handles many programs (itunes Office etc.). Plus it easily fits in my messenger bag and is lightweight so I am not lugging around a heavy laptop. And the value is unbeatable (much better than the Chromebook I wasted money on)!
5,I bought this tablet to replace an RCA / Windows tablet that was struggling to hang on. I needed a Windows tablet because I use MS Word to view all my music chord and lyric charts when I perform music. There aren't many choices out there for a Windows tablet now all I could find was this Fusion tablet and those really expensive MS Surface tablets. This tablet was about a quarter the price of one of those Surface tablets and seems to be perfectly adequate for my needs.
4,I think it's perfect for somebody like me that once a computer and a tablet both. It does and is what it says in the description. I don't think it's too complicated to use. I like how big the screen is and how vivid the colors are
5,With its hardware specs this Windows 10 tablet has all the essential ports and features that is great for daily use. It is fast and powerful enough to run Microsoft Office Suite browsing internet and other applications that I installed that I thought would caused performance issues or problems or even worse wouldn’t even run. It is recommended to stay in Windows 10 S mode to ensure that the tablet will run smoothly and more secure but the application I installed required a full Windows 10 mode. So I switched from Windows 10 S mode the tablet still has no issues at all running all applications. It is a tad slower but the applications still run perfectly. No crashes no screen freeze. Keep in mind that the hardware has its limitations therefore only a few applications can be run at a time to keep the performance stable. I usually only run an application at a time; max 2. The tablet is made of good quality material also. I was surprised and more than satisfied with the tablet’s performance compared with the chrome laptop I bought with the same price. For its quality performance and value this tablet deserves a 5 stars.
3,Update:Be wary of the Fusion store. About two weeks after purchasing the tablet I received a flyer by mail promising a gift of my choice in exchange for a review on Amazon. I provided the below review and followed all directions but never received the keyboard gift I specified. The tablet is indeed a quality item but be super careful with the Fusion store if you order accessories or require support. Lousy customer service!I purchased this tablet PC specifically for use with amateur radio because it features a full-size USB port - essential for using the programming cables that are need to set-up many radios and because it runs Windows OS.  I have not been disappointed in it's ease of set-up clear screen graphics and familiar windows environment.  The unit is compact yet has a screen large enough to easily view spreadsheets and watch videos.  The battery is about average life for a unit this size and is more than adequate to take me through several hours of radio programming.  This table PC is an essential part of my deployment kit and highly recommended for the price!  Very happy with it!
5,First purchased the Chuwi HI10 due to its higher resolution screen than the Fusion 5. After using the Chuwi for a few days it just didn’t feel right - startups were clunky the annoying windows 10 on screen volume control wouldn’t go away and the higher resolution screen actually made things harder to see as everything is displayed in much finer detail - which sounds counterintuitive - but I use this device with TeamViewer to monitor my trading charts when away from my computer and the finer detail made the charts harder to read.This unit was meant to replace my Asus 101a tablet that developed a bad micro USB port.So I went ahead and ordered the Fusion 5 tablet that has a similar screen resolution to the Asus and it worked beautifully with my stock charts on TeamViewer.There are no odd startup issues with Windows 10 and it runs very smoothly. Additionally it has a full size USB 3.0 port which should be much more durable than the micro usb that failed on my Asus. You can also have the charger plugged in while the USB port is in use unlike the Asus which is a huge plus.Also the recommended case for the Chuwi was complete crap that would fall over when used as a stand for the tablet with the slightest touch.Amazon was fantastic on the return which I avoided shipping charges by using an Amazon drop station nearby.So for a 10” windows 10 tablet I am 100% satisfied.
1,I acquired this tablet to run my robotic sewing machine.  It exceeded the requirements and the price was great.  My only issue is that the power cord is a bit short.  If I forget to unplug it before I launch the software it pulls the tablet crooked in the cradle as the machine moves forward & exceeds the cord length.  Unplugging it limited quilting time as it doesn't work for more than 3 hours or so while running the quilting machine.  The advertised battery capacity/longevity was inaccurate (said 6 hours in the Q&A).  Not a crisis but annoying. I acquired a longer cord so that problem was solved.  I wish I had gotten a larger version (12 inch not 10) but I was trying to not spend a fortune.As for the actual tablet- it is great touch screen works WiFi works all good. Ran a little slow but fit my needs. There was some occasional instability experienced when running the quilting software but I thought it could have been the software not the computer......then after 5 months and 4 days it inexplicably died in the middle of quilting a row.  The screen started flashing/flickering - looked like long skinny rectangles of different colors flashing around and occasionally you could see the quilting interface flicker through.  It was non-responsive.  I had to do a hard shut down. And now it will not start back up.  It was fully charged.  Recharging it does not help.I reached out to Fusion5 since it is still under warranty.  They require it to be mailed to them.  OK I get that.  How can they fix it if they do not receive it?  Nor do they just send you a new one without checking this one out.  I can understand that too. They do not pay the shipping - and that makes me very disappointed even kinda mad.  Seems like they could accept responsibility for that.In the meantime I hooked up my laptop to the quilting machine because I have customers expecting their stuff to get done on time....  And guess what!  The quilting machine works fine with the laptop - no instabilities no long pauses it just works as advertised.  This tells me the issue is not the software it was always the tablet.The moral of the story- go ahead and spend the money to get a quality product especially when dealing with computers. If you cheap out it most likely will NOT 'be good enough'. It will be sub-par and will probably croak in the middle of something important and to get it fixed will cost you more money.Would I buy a Fusion5 tablet again? Absolutely not.
5,Fusion 5 10.1" Windows 10 Tablet  Didn't want to buy a laptop so I bought this tablet instead to handle smaller tasks that I normally do on my desktop.  From what I can see it handled everything quite well.  Since I have always used windows there was nothing to learn was able to jump right in and start working.  For a tablet it's pretty fast and you can't beat the price  I needed something convient to take on my semi-annual medical trips just connect to the hotel wi fi and it's just like I never left.  I needed something that I could understand like a Windows 10 operating system.  It's like looking at my desktop computer but only smaller.  Does everything I hoped it would do even more.  The only drawback that I can see is the sound.  It's not very loud at all I would invest in a pair of bluetooth headphones.
5,Easy to use perfect size clear image of the diagnostic screen it's used for.
5,When it comes to computer technology I normally only buy Apple branded products. I’m a very loyal Apple customer because I find them to have the best computers especially when it comes to tablets so buying another brand was difficult for me. I had a very hard time making a decision on which non Apple tablet to purchase as I’m not an expert on non Apple products since I’m not use to them. I have however found this tablet to work well. It doesn’t act like a tablet but rather a full out computer. The screen quality battery life and touch screen all work as it should. If I had to complain about something it’d have to be volume quality. It’s just lousy so for best quality I recommend using headphones. The $200 price was hard to let go of but when it comes to tablets I don’t want to pay too low of a price because you do get what you pay for. So the real questions here are - Is it worth the price and would I recommend this tablet pc to others. My answers to both questions are yes and yes.
5,This tablet is affordable and works great. The touch screen works seamlessly. The battery last a fair amount of time depending on what you use it for and how bright you keep the screen. The Bluetooth works nice.I purchased this tablet to run a digital sheet music program. I am a piano player and I wanted something affordable to use to display my digital music and use a Bluetooth page turner pedal while I was playing. It works wonderfully. The screen is perfect for now but if I ever need reading glasses it would be a bit small. I have not bought the keyboard to use with it yet but it will be exciting to see how it works with the tablet. This tablet reminds me off my original surface I had except this has full windows instead of an abbreviated version.
5,Although my usage of this tablet is limited it does its job very well. I use it to control my Shapeoko Pro CNC and it has worked flawlessly. The only thing I needed to do was upgrade one of the Windows .dll files for the Carbide Motion software to operate properly. Apparently Carbide Create uses a newer version of this .dll file that comes with the version of Windows preinstalled. It was very easy to download and install. This was an issue with the Carbide Motion software only and NOT the tablet itself. Also there's an easy workaround for the new to me Windows security thing that prevents certain kinds of downloads. Download the fix install it and it's done forever.  If I had the need I would buy another. Thumbs up!
5,Great Windows 10-based Tablet that allows most/all peripherals programs apps that are used on standard Windows PC.  Perfect for on-the-go travel working out when you don't need the full PC.  I used this mostly for entertainment and reading while riding the indoor bike and elliptical since it also allowed me to access my work email (requires smart card reader device/software that requires Windows PC interface).  Extremely pleased and would highly recommend for cheaper alternative to Microsoft Surface.
4,This tablet is easy to start with. charge it up turn it on and even a dinosaur can use it. My purpose was music and stores will have lots of apps to help. Remember it's not a Surface Pro and you have to link it with wifi and security normal tedium. The user guide lacks detail and is generic not very useful but if you're careful you won't need it.
5,Purchased the Fusion5 Windows 10 tablet to upgrade from an iPad.  Needed a Windows based tablet for use at work (in field) as well as something I could use in-car to data log that at a reasonable price.  Not sure how I managed without this so much easier to use both in field and in car.  I have been using my new Fusion5 for 9 days straight in the field and it has met all my expectations actually exceeded them. Battery life and performance are great.  I have the 4GB RAM model with 64GB memory (FWIN232+).  In addition to my work programs and HP Tuners software I have Office 2013 installed and it handles everything like a champ.  Just ordered an Ethernet port and active stylus to see if compatible with this tablet.  And finally found a case that does not cover any ports or buttons or cameras.  And yes it appears that it does come with screen protector already installed.Link to case: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01G17X8F4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=12/3/2020:  Just received the Adonit Ink active stylus.  Did not work so these tablets do not support MPP protocol.  Going to try the Wacom Bamboo Tip next...
2,some small issues after the first couple of hours first the power supply that came with it is a Walmart type universal power supply that doesn't work.  2nd the screen isnt smooth.  It feels grainy to the touch.  You also have to press on the screen a little harder than other tablets Ive had.  So far thats it.  Starting it up and syncing it to my Microsoft accounts went smooth.  I can access the cloud and internet really easy.  Again not bad but not good.
5,When I ordered this tablet I was skeptical that I could get a decent Windows machine for just a little over $200.  The unit arrived in one day we unboxed it plugged it in to charge it and proceeded to run the Windows setup program.  Everything worked perfectly!  We use Windows tablets as public checkin stations.  I have been paying over $500 for other tablets and we just had three broken in the last 2 months.  I decided to try this machine.  We just finished testing it and we are so pleased with the fit finish and performance.  I now have a new standard windows tablet for our organization.  Low price quick delivery and same Windows performance.  My coworker thinks this tablet actually works better than our current machines.  This one's a winner.
4,I needed a little computer to use for simple work tasks like sending email Amazon shopping ;) and watching videos.  I decided a tablet would be nice to give me a little more versatility than a laptop.  I knew I wanted a windows operating system because that is what I am used to.  I decided to go with this tablet because I liked the size (small enough to fit in my purse but big enough to watch a movie)  and the price was right.  It has worked pretty well for what i needed.  The touch screen is responsive and the speakers work well enough.  I did get a keyboard dock for it.  It is a little slow but I chalk that up to an iffy internet connection and I'm thinking an added memory card might help.
5,I was looking for a featherweight laptop replacement for travel purposes but didn’t want to shell out $1200+ for a Surface or other folio style laptops.I took a look at this Windows tablet and thought “how bad can it be?”... and decided to go ahead.The unit is very small and light: I purchased the Logitech universal keyboard as I didn’t quite trust the cheaper alternative but maybe I should have as the Logitech is “ok” and definitely not impressive.I have the 4GB RAM version (I was skeptical about the 2GB) and 64GB storage. I have also added a 128 GB Samsung mini-card and diverted all new apps there.The unit is ok and so far I can’t complain.I find it a little slow/clunky in opening/closing apps and the touchscreen is not always perfect. I have a stylus pen and noticed that using the disc tip scratched the screen very easily... so I’m now using the fiber tip.The screen is tiny and so are the icons (you can certainly make them bigger but I have an issue with very large icons I think they look goofy).I can’t speak of longevity since I’ve only had this unit for a week or so. Time will tell but for the moment I’m happy with the cost effectiveness of my purchase.
4,Don’t like how you can barely hear anything through tablet built i speakers even in quite room. Very disappointing since I bout it for my mon and her hearing is not the best.  Now I have to spend more money on external speakers and have her carry those around with her??? Dumb!
5,I reviewed many tablets prior to purchasing the Fusion FWIN232+. The fusion checked all the boxes I was looking for at a fair price. I ordered my Fusion through Amazon which arrived safely two days later. Packaging was solid with no problems I inventoried everything which all was there. Setup was simple registration was just as easy. I have used my tablet daily I am impressed with its speed screen quality and sturdiness. The speaker is difficult to hear if you have external noise around you. I will be adding an external speaker. The Fusion comes with a USB adapter which is great since I added a wireless mouse. Overall this tablet is a great value for the money.
4,Took a learning curve to operate due to being a computer not a tablet (didn't realize the difference when previewing /ordering). But like it overall.
5,I like that it's able to hold my downloaded files and run them. I wish the screens were bigger size. But all in all it's a great tablet. Works very well. So far no problems at all.
4,Screen size is good touch response is a bit sluggish. It’s runs well on the programs I use. I like that it has a USB port.  If you need a tablet that runs windows this is a good choice.
4,Processor could be updated and memory increased for better handling of multimedia projects. Nevertheless can handle typical day-to-day tasks like internet browsing email and social media without problems. It is a great product for the cost
5,I don’t generally write product reviews but this time I had to share my opinion of this product.I had a Galaxy Tablet for five years it was not holding a charge and I figured it was time to get anotherTablet.  I wasn’t looking for a lot of technology just wanted to download games look at my email and be able to use window’s version.  The “Fusion 5 Ultra Slim Windows Tablet PC” is all that and a “bag of chips!”  I ordered the Tablet April 5th and it was delivered April 10th.  I can run Windows version surf the internet zoom with family an play games. I am certain there’s many other features that I’ve not discovered yet.  This is a “gem”  - particularly now that we are all trying to distance ourselves from each other and yet trying to remain connected.  I highly recommend this Tablet! It just like having a PC in the palm of your hands.!!  Darlene G.
4,(This does not contain my thoughts on Windows or Windows products)TL;DR Great price good tablet lots of options for memory and hardware expansion.I purchased two of these. They are being used as kiosk check in stations and entertainment/education machines in a church children's department.The price was very affordable which makes this tablet extremely accessible for someone looking for a mobile computing machine for work or entertainment.It's screen has been responsive bright and clear. I would suggest a screen protector as fingerprints are very visible but easy to wipe off.The speakers while small serve their purpose conveniently there is a headphone jack and it also has bluetooth.It has several ports which make connecting to printers speakers hard drives etc very easy. It also supports a dock connection for keyboard.  I like that all the ports are on the same side of the machine.When I purchased these for $199 I did not see the 11.6" for that same price. I would probably have prefered the bigger size over these had I had the opportunity (however it has less RAM and memory)
5,Peace. This computer is probably one of the best cpu I bought. The fact it’s a laptop in tablet form is justification enough. The price is a steal. I am about a month in with mine setup was simple enough with a outlook email. I have no problems with tabs and navigating the windows 10. Once I learned to switch off s mode I was able to get the official zoom meetings to download. The cameras work perfectly and have good quality for the meetings. Bluetooth works good with my ear buds but have yet to try anything else. The docking station works ok with the cpu but I’ll leave that for a separate review. The fusion is fast and seems very reliable. I have also streamed movies which has worked well so far. I may even pay for the Microsoft 365 for a year subscription. I teccomend this fusion tablet/pc for anyone on the go and just need a reliable business pc.
5,I have this tablet connected to my laser engraver so that way I can work on my personal computer while the engraver is working. Tablet is super fast and works perfect with my diode machine. Really good purchase!
5,I needed a slim tablet to access email and documents when I'm away from the office and I have a tight budget. I felt like I was taking a chance on this model as I didn't know the brand name. So far (a few months of service in my briefcase with regular use in coffee shops and lobbies) it's performed very well. The battery life has been excellent and the screen is good for any indoor use. It connects easily with my phone hotspot (my business can't use public wifi) and lets me stay in touch or get critical emails. I also connected a bluetooth keyboard I use for my phone and it worked great. I get a lot of data handed to me on USB drives so having a full USB port without needing a dongle is really good.I can't address storage as I use cloud for all my files and I don't want any client info on a tablet that could get lost but it's a good windows 10 machine that has no problem connecting to my networks. For the price I feel like it over-delivered on what I was expecting.
4,Arrived yesterday with no problems. Installed Norton Advanced System Care eM Client email Windows Commander Google Chrome and my VPN. I still have over 30GB left. I also installed a 128GB micro sd card for added storage space. I synched up my bluetooth keyboard with no issues. Tried playing movies from flash drive with no problems. I also hooked up a Magic Jack adapter to the USB port to see if I can make phone calls with it. It works perfect. This was important to me because I am getting ready to make an extended trip overseas and wanted to be able to keep in touch with family. This tablet is great!!! The only complaint I have is the volume is poor. If you install external speakers or use earbuds then no problems. I recommend you also purchase a USB hub.
5,My laptop stopped working needed something cheap and mobile. I settled for Fusion after all the great review. You can do anything with this pad except of course for creating music. I got this in 2019 have not purchased laptop and not intending to. you can insert usb load up your DJ and play tons of music all night long.  What attracted me is that this have USB capable while other don't. They can work on the touch screen though it's not too sensitive it could be good thing but so far I used it more often than my  other regular Android Pad which i bought before Fusion Windows Pad.
4,I purchased this tablet because I wanted a full windows 10 os. Works well and loads quick enough only con was sound volume at max was too low for me to hear in a home with other things going on otherwise it does everything else fine videos webcams streaming from websites all ok. I would recommend taking it out of S mode limits your apps from other companies. Its just a control thing none of my other PC's have this?? Overall its a good buy.
4,Works for what I need it for.  Just wish the screen had a factory plastic cover.  I would rate it 5 stars  but it scratches REALLY EASILY.  I would advise not to even touch it before you buy a screen cover and I am very careful with my things.
5,Bought this tablet to use for professional use and absolutely LOVE IT! It’s very user friendly touch screen works great and it’s like having my laptop with me without it taking up a lot of space. I would highly recommend for people who need to work on the go without wanting to take a large laptop everywhere.
2,Slower than Molasses
4,I would be enjoying this along with my Fusion 10" tablet but I Never Saw the memory card-even though herein it states delivery on 6-May-2021?????Screen quality is nice along with the battery life too. I'm in graduate school and this unit gives me proper support for classes. I have not had the unit to shut down due to a low battery so far. I do remove the power cord once battery is fully charged to spare the battery life.
4,bought another one as a replacement so we consider it a good buy
4,This tablet is great! Its fast i can mutiltask (which is good for my job ) without any problems i can use alot of apps at one time the display and the pictute crisp bright and vivd. This tablet is perfect weight so i can handle it easier. It has alot of memory i can download alot apps without the warning saying " not enough space". I install the screen protector that it came with in the package. The sound is a little off so it needs a touch of improvement. You can't sync this tablet with your PC. The price of the tablet is great and its so better than others its affordable but the tablet execles the expectations. I am heavy user i pretty much use it everyday. I would buy it again and would recommended other to pay for this tablet
1,This is by far the worst electronic item that I have ever owned and that's saying a lot. It was so bad in fact that I felt blessed when it died after only three days of use.First the name of the product implies that it runs some form of Windows 10 which is why I purchased it but it doesn't. It's just an Android and operates very poorly even at that.It is the absolute slowest Android that I've ever encountered. When I'd tap the touchscreen it usually took more than 30 seconds to respond at minimum and sometimes it took several minutes to respond or else even locked up and never responded at all. Many common functions weren't operable such as when you tap on the little "eye" icon to visibly see a password -- it doesn't respond to that. I couldn't close tabs when using Microsoft Edge since the operating system wouldn't recognize the little "X" that you use to do that. So the only way to close tabs was to shut down and restart the tablet. It also didn't recognize volume bars such as those on YouTube other than to choose between no sound at all or else maximum volume.The screen resolution also left much to be desired. Even on the best setting the images were nowhere near as crisp and clear as those I've seen before even on older devices.I own a refurbed LG Stylo 3 Smartphone which is also an Android and for which I paid only about $40 and it is far superior to this tablet. I found this tablet to be completely insufferable for a multitude of reasons including those detailed above as well as other issues. I would never recommend that anyone purchase this item because you can buy much better Androids than this one for the same amount of money or even less.And the fact that it lasted only three days was the ultimate insult. I make many many purchases on Amazon and rarely leave reviews especially not bad ones but my experience with this tablet was so horrid that I felt very strongly compelled to warn others away from purchasing it.Needless to say I will be returning this item as soon as I get back home from vacation.
4,I've bought this tablet as Interface for my CNC Router It has a mini USB port with adapter pig tails for male and female USB connections - did not use it for it's intended purpose just yet but I ordered it after watching a YouTube video of a CNC user that highly recommended this specific tablet for just that purpose
5,I've mainly used it for watching Netflix movies and YouTube videos and browsing the internet on a daily basis since I bought it about a month ago and so far so good - It works well as expected. Cameras work; power charging can be done via both the power cord and mini-USB but the power cord seems more efficient; no boult-in GPS so if you want to use it for navigation you need an extra GPS double; there is a MicroSD port that you can use for extra storage - I use a 64Gb MicroSD and it works well. I was able to connect both the (2-way) mouse and keyboard vis the USB or the mouse only via Bluetooth. I have an old android tablet but I really like this Fusion5 Windows 10 (Home Edition) Tablet PC regarding its speed and the great potential of running any Windows 10 applications. It is noteworthy that for a tablet like this no one can beat the price! I got it the next day when I placed the order with Amazon Prime and I got it the next day - the shipping was really really fast!
3,I wanted to like this tablet but Im returning it. I thought it would be powerful enough for what I needed but turned out it was weak even for the given specs. The DDR3 memory is slow and the CPU (Cherry Trail x5-Z8350 introduced in 2016) Just doesn't hold up today and add that to the fact it has a 7th gen GPU makes this tablet's performance poor. In addition the USB 3 slot is SUPER TIGHT! IT took alot of force to insert any full size USB. Speaking of you'll need a USB WiFi adapter if you want decent speed as the built in is Wireless N and unable to connect to quicker AC networks.  The screen however was actually pretty good and the speakers were better than I thought they'd be.I simply could not justify keeping it with such low performance.
5,i use this to stream movies all the time and play my remote play with my play station 4 pro. the picture quality is great and speed is pretty good too. have not had any issues with it at all.
5,This is a powerful little tablet and I use mine in a woodworking shop to run a CNC router.  It interfaces just fine with the equipment offering full PC functionality.  Being a dust-filled environment I could not use a PC with a fan.  Found this little guy and it has everything I needed for a great price.  3 months into it and no complaints.
5,Now that I've had the Fusion 5 for a couple of months I can say that overall it's a good product and functions very well as a Windows computer. The screen quality is quite good and you can put a whopping SD card in to complement the memory.  I bought the 64 gig version  so far no problems with wed surfing downloading from the web transferring between machines wifi etc. It is a bit slow here and there but IT WORKS and it runs Windows 10 as well. The size is also complimentary to travel and the keyboard case that's available has the perfect keyboard. Add a micro usb wireless mouse and you're in.
5,Great tablet for the price. Easy to use. Touch screen speed and battery life might not be the very best therefore I did not give a full score but I am nonetheless now very satisfied. It is a product that will come with me wherever I go and I will use for emergency stuff so we will see how tough it is. It took me a bit of a curve to learn as its touch screen feels and reacts differently (at the very beginning I was not satisfied because it was not reacting to my touch fast enough but then it got or I got much better) and it is over all slower and very different than an Apple iPad (I am an Apple person) but now I am comfortable using it and it is becoming a more faithful companion.  I bought it because certain programs I am using for emergency do not work on Apple and because I did not want to bring with me something that has personal data on it and is too expensive in situations that might be tough on electronics.
4,This is a great tablet for the price I paid for it. I am using it for my laptop purpose. It can be used as tablet or laptop whatever you want. Very nice display good sound quality. But i still need to check battery life. Touch screen is excellent.
4,I am going to use this in the field at night for an astrophotography program that runs on Windows only. One odd but minor thing is that the USB 3 port is right side up (logo up) but the little USB port is logo down. I would buy a non-slip sleeve for it to reduce the risk of dropping it but cannot find one.Since the program I am going to install is not sold by Microsoft I had to jump through some hoops to get rid of the "S" in the OS.
4,I really like the quality of the product as far as case and screen as well as the input options.  I have another Windows tablet from RCA but I was surprised how large the screen is--and clear.  I would recommend it luckily for me I had a bluetooth keyboard.  That is the only thing I would recommend that someone purchase is you wanna do work (or write a novel).  Good solid product.
4,It was very easy to set up. Would like more memory.
5,I like the value that it provides. It’s great for ghost hunting apps that I need.
4,I need a computer that I can easily bring with me and does not intimidate people when I visit them to take notes for eulogies and other life cycle occasions. I have used a tablet for several years but found that it did not have enough memory for MS updates. The Fusion5  is 1/3 the price of my previous tablet slightly bigger but still very light. It has enough solid state memory to handle every program I need. I use the Fusion5 to photograph family pictures for my work. The pictures come out well but I haven't really tested the camera's capabilities. This tablet permits me to do something I've always wanted to use it at life cycle events directly instead of printing out material. This makes it ideal for last minute changes. The RAM is big enough for normal computer functions.
5,Plenty powerful for a tablet. I'm writing this in Firefox with 10 other tabs open including resource hogs like FaceBook YouTube & GMail. Task Manager performance tab shows 4 apps 52 background processes 97 Windows processes running and only  22% CPU & 73% message usage. I use a Logitech K480 keyboard a Digio mouse and a 128GB SD card and use it like a desktop at my kitchen table. I had used a Toshiba Encore 2 for years till the blue tooth module failed. This is not only an excellent replacement it's an improvement. I love that it has mini USB & full size USB 3 ports. The display is bright and sharp. Can't really comment on battery life since I rarely take it mobile for very long. The only complaint I have is that the onboard speakers are under powered. All in all an excellent value.
4,I like this product alot it's like a tablet but it's a laptop and it's pretty convenient for me I like the size of it alot and I really like this tablet laptop
4,I've been testing this tablet for some days and overall its been a positive experience. For its price I've got a great display with 4-6 hours of battery life on normal browsing and watching. However I recommend to switch out of Windows S because it became a bit laggy out of the box. It has a few hiccups here and there and its performance depends a lot on your usage. Since I've set it up the lag reduced and its a perfect portable temporary laptop substitute for traveling. I love it so far and hope it lasts!
5,4 GB RAM. 64 GB internal storage. Micro SD card slot. Full size USB port. Micro HDMI port.This tablet is very responsive and runs cool.Interesting use case: I am totally blind and purchased this Tablet to run my radio automation software from Stationplaylist. Runs Creator Studio VT server flawlessly. Over 7 hr’s of battery life per charge. I am running JAWS 2019 (screen reading software) very responsive with touch screen USB keyboard or braille display (over Bluetooth.Audio: internal stereo speakers ( adequate for JAWS). Bluetooth audio flawless. Headphones (stereo mini jack)  please note this is a standard mini jack therefore headphones which also contains the ring for microphone will not work. You will have to purchase a separate adapter to listen to a pair of headphones with an integrated microphone. Processor speed looks to be 4.9 GHZ. I like the somewhat scratchy plastic on the back as it does not allow the tablet to slide around. All in all I am very impressed with this tablet as it runs my software without issues hands down. Look at your specs for the software you were looking to run before purchasing this tablet.
5,This Fusion Windows is my first tablet PC and overall I'm impressed with its capabilities.  It's like having a mini powerful CPU! The screen color and definition is crisp and clean thanks to the display adjustability.  The battery life is great.  I've found that if I keep unused apps and windows closed the battery life is extended.  The touch screen is responsive touch by touch - If you remember to do a "medium-hard" tap instead of that gentle touch for each letter and/or screen choice entry.  If you're new to using a tablet as your computer you'll be pleasantly rewarded with the help options that appear as you navigate through the seemingly endless awesome options.
4,The 10 inch screen is fine for watch videos and using the pop up keyboard. This PC replaces several android pads that lacked the convience of windows OS I've spent decades learning. A bit slow compared to desk tops with newer chips memory and SSDs.  Otherwise happy with the cost vs performance for a toss around PC.
3,This is a decent tablet - thin lightweight and easy to hold. Construction is solid and the screen looks great with very good touch.  All that being said it's just too slow.  Using Chrome browser with two or three tabs open slows the system down so it just lags and takes forever to load.  It says it has 4GB of ram but the Atom chip can only utilize a max of 2GB so I'm not sure if that extra 2GB is being utilized or if it's just sitting there (or if the specs are spoofed).  Regardless the Surface Go (good used ones are less than $100 more) I have is much speedier and blows through 15 open Chrome tabs with no problem - I'd recommend saving your money and passing on this and getting a better tablet.
5,I've had the tablet for a few weeks and really like it a lot. I specifically wanted a tablet with a USB plug so I could look at a portable hard drive and it had one.  So I was able to download Microsoft office to read my docs on the hard drive and also downloaded Chrome to use to explore the internet. I am very pleased with how it's performing so far. The touch screen is a bit slow at times but that's just a matter of keeping the screen clean. 5 Stars!
4,I was looking for a Windows 10 tablet that was not another laptop or one of Microsoft's versions of a tablet.  Sure glade I kept searching.  Loaded all my important software that I use while traveling some of  is loaded the added 128 G byte micro chip.  Very fast vs. my laptop remains a standard moving head hard drive.  Added an external 5 G bit antenna using the micro USB jack with a short micro to standard USB cable.  The added download speed is great.  No issues with the driver update for the add-on antenna.  Have used the tablet for around 5 weeks with no issues.  I wrote an email to the product team suggesting the addition of an internal 5 G antenna.  For the size performance and the price I love it.  My Samsung Tab A is very lonely now.
4,Very nice tablet and WAY better than any Android tablet Ive used. This aligns with MS Surface RT but with regular windows so one can do whatever without limitation especially since this is way easier on ones pocketbook! Nice graphics touch screen variety of options to use on screen keyboards on screen touchpad use stylus write freehand.....as i said way more way better than Android tablets. Can add docking keyboard too if desired. Have had tablet for a week now and so far very impressed with it. This also compliments using along side a laptop. As others have said the speakers volume is not as good.....clear and good sound just not loud enough even when set on 98 or 100. But I'm using bluetooth earphones or bluetoothing to external speaker to get around the low volume produced by the tablet's speakers. Using either of these all good. Basically this is a great lil tablet so far and impressions are good. :)
5,This Windows tablet is what u expect3dnit to be it has a good feel to it and does exactly what I need it to do.
5,Screen came with a defect sent it back into Fusion and they had amazing communication. They told me via email when they received it and mailed it back! Only took a week to fix including shipping time.  They made the best of a unfortunate situation and I will continue ordering from them in the future just because of their customer service and the tablet was what I expected. I love the tablet and practically live on it with work.
4,Okay this one will be weird. I am in the process of returning it for a refund. I absolutely loved this device. It really was like having an laptop in tablet form. My only issue is that it froze on me and I eventually was able to power it down. However it would not come back on. I tried over anseriesnof days. Funny enough it turned back on once I slipped it into return pouch. Unfortunately that is too late. Before that it was a at least a 4 star experience. May consider down the road but only with an extended warranty included.
5,I was looking for an affordable and reliable windows based tablet and found it.The speed is very good.The touch screen is responsive and accurate.The product met all my expectations.Recommended for anyone looking for a windows tablet.
3,I ordered this tablet to use at my work for running diagnostic software. When running the diagnostic program there is about 3 seconds of delay between when you select an item on the menu and when it actually clicks it. Overall the build quality is good and the attachable keyboard is awesome. I would recommend it for running small programs but would avoid running bigger ones.
4,Great tablet especially for the price. works well. I am happy with the purchase. It is a portable lightweight and I can use it on the train while commuting to/from work.
3,Purchase it as a Christmas present it worked for about a week on the original power supply until power supply failed.. replacement power supply lasted two weeks and then it failed.
4,it surprised me by having everything my desktop has was very easy to set up didn't have a bunch of things installed that i would've had to uninstalled only things i actually use. I didn't have long enough yet but the battery didn't hold up as long as i had hoped but it did run a lot of things.  Also the case with keyboard i order with it put scratches on both sides but thankfully the thin plastic is all that got scratched. I am returning it only because i just want a tablet & this has way more than I wanted its like having my big desk top in a mini version. Sounds weird i know but if i was purchasing as a laptop it would've been perfect.
5,Delivery was quick and there no no issues with the tablet upon receipt. We use this tablet to program our Onity RFID locks run lock reports and run tests of our lock systems. This tablet has been reliable in all facets of operation and more than meets our needs.
5,Just got my Fusion tablet today right on time.  I sent a question to the seller and received nearly immediate assistance with my question.  If this tablet is as good as the customer service I will be very well satisfied.  Just working a few setup items out of the box has been easy and the tablet seems quick to respond.  As I have more experience with the tablet I will provide additional feedback.  But for now it is all that I expected.
4,Not a bells-and-whistles machine but very good for price. Had not intended to subject it to intense use but was concerned that it might be too tied to Windows S. Switched S for standard 10 and with 4 MB of memory handles the non-windows-store programs I needed quite well. Screen struggles a bit in bright light.
5,I bought this tablet for my project and its performing exceptionally well!
4,Decent Tablet for the money it has usb to the side which allows for additional functionality. Also HDMI connection to plug into a bigger screen if desired. The Windows mode can be a plus or a negative. I understand the extra safety if its given to a child but it limits your ability to install apps. I had to leave the window mode in order to install zoom. Not a big deal.
5,This machine was quite easy to set up. Any problems I had with the setup revolved around working with Microsoft. I actually had the machine totally set up within 4 hours. I set it up so that my wife could easily use it and she is not fond of computers. I have used this machine for only 10 or 12 hours but I can say I have found nothing that is an unsolvable problem. I actually like this machine enough to consider purchasing an additional Fusion5 to carry around the material I use for presentations it would be lighter than my laptop. It could also be a backup for my laptop. The Fusion5  easily connects to a projector do need a mini HDMI to standard HDMI adapter but it works well.
4,Arrived right on time.  Was not what I thought it should be.  Said it was a computer/tablet. But you cannot do on this machine what you can do on a Samsung tablet. Kind of disappointed.  If you want a laptop this is ok.  Just not a real tablet.
5,This is a newer product with limited review.  I had a Surface Pro 2 killed by Win10.  Didn't need that much power for browsing the internet purchasing from Amazon emailing.  So I took a chance and purchased this tablet.  Build quality is good textured back makes easy to hold onto.  Only issue is a small bubble under glass down by windows logo.  I have been using for 3 weeks and it has preformed very well.  I normally get more battery life than needed.  I have seen more than 10 hours of battery life on a couple of occasions.  I have played some HTML5 games with no issues.  Video's play fine no stuttering or playback issues.  I feel for the money this fits my needs great.  I would like to see more accessories like a type style keyboard and screen protector.  I have not loaded office applications so I cannot provide feedback for usage of it.  I will update if I experience any issues.
4,So I have only worked on my tablet a little bit. I did have an issue downloading some stuff but then downloaded Chrome and after that my initial download worked. I bought for my Cameo 3 and am very excited to have a windows tablet for under $200. I hope it meets my expectations as the reviews have been very positive. I can't comment on the battery life since I have not had the opportunity to test it yet. I did notice the touch screen is not as responsive but I believe that is just a learning curve on my case. At least I hope. All in all I am happy so far and super excited to be trying it out more when I get the time.
4,Need small fingers to use the screen. get a blu tooth mouse to save the usb port.Unable to increase the size of printInternal keyboard is to large and covers bottom of open app causing you not to be able to type on bottom of appcausing you to by an external keyboard.
5,If you need a tablet that runs Windows 10 this could be the one. While not speedy it provides enough power to run apps without pause including streaming video from the popular streaming services. I especially like the external ports provided. Easy to add extra memory storage. Since I needed a tablet that ran specific Windows 10 applications for the price I don't think this tablet can be beat.
5,What an upgrade for my cnc machine.  It provides speed accuracy and clear visible status as my projects run.  Using a laptop for this was less productive and in a dusty shop the Fusion 5 really hit the spot. Not being a PC person connection was easy switching from S mode to Home and downloading the patch for my controller went well. Everything works as planned very happy with performance and will purchase again for other machines.
5,I was very impressed with this Fusion 5 it is running windows 10s. Everything is very sharp and crisp which I value. And it runs faster than my regular laptop that is running windows 10 pro. I even was able to hook my wireless mouse to it and a bluetooth keyboard and it is just a slick unit.I have many tablets and this one became my number one for every thing that I do now. It is light weight and easy to handle. I am really enjoy using this.
5,I own an older Samsung tablet which recently ran it's course. I got tired of downloading and updating apps so I purchased this Windows tablet. So far it has been exactly what I need for work.The tablet works with my old bluetooth keyboard and mouse and certainly is an upgrade from my previous tablet. I am impressed with the screen and battery life to this point.Based on my research this is one of the faster tablets available (especially in this price range) with the 4GB RAM. That is crucial if you plan on using it for work.
5,This is a great little tablet.  I have had computers for many years and recall my first real one which cost $3200 and had a wopping 32mb of memory a 386 processor and took up lots of floorspace and the monitor took up the whole desk.  Contrast that with this great little tablet.  When hooked up to a monitor/TV it is great!!  What is even better is the price...$199.  I use it for my personal business running the windows applications and it does everything I could ask for.  Thanks for the great value.
5,I use the Fusion5 for household record keeping.  I wanted something which works like a laptop but is relatively small and easily portable.  Not being a computer 'expert' I was not sure which type of device would suit my needs.  The Fusion5 fits the bill.  I'm now able to work on my records wherever I am.  It enables me to be more productive and efficient.  The only negative I have is the touch screen which I'm still adjusting to (seems my touch may need a bit of work so I don't have to touch the screen a few times to get the response I'm seeking).  I would recommend the Fusion5 to friends family whoever needs a powerful tool which is portable.K. Dobbins
5,Absolutely love them it’s like having my desktop with me.
4,I'm really impressed with the vast I/O ports and wireless capabilities included. The memory card slot is a huge BONUS... well thought out product design. The battery seems to be ample and... it's Windows 10. I've had a Microsoft Surface Pro this is a far better machine and for less.I will sure be getting the Keyboard/Folder accessory. ...less than $50
4,As a long time windows power user I needed an inexpensive tablet to use on the treadmill at the gym in the car and sitting comfortably on the couch.  This fusion5 works just fine for me as advertised.  Yes it is quite under powered compared to my desktop tower but because of the portability of the device the full featured operating system and the familiar interface it is well worth the bargain cost.  I also bought a docking keyboard which I use occasionally.  For me this product is much better than a kindle or any expensive apple product for what it does and I expect to see even more powerful versions in the future.
5,Does what I need it to do. I use it for reading in bed on kindle app and do basic things online. I even use it in the sauna (infrared) to watch lectures and it hasn't been an issue.
4,This tablet is slightly heavier than I had anticipated but not so much as to be uncomfortable.  The packaging on it both in the carrier box & the unit box were packaged extremely well.  It seem as if most tech gadgets you purchase now does not include any sort of manual.  Albeit small there is one included.  One thing I was disappointed about & it probably was just an oversight on my part but I thought it already had Microsoft Office downloaded & ready to use - not the case.  So will be checking that out but all in all I do like the tablet.The tablet is a little bit slower than I would like but not so much that it interfers with what I need to do.
5,Update  :  I bought a second one! 🙂 My nephew loves it. He uses it to connect to his online classes now that school is long distance due to covid. So far no complaints. The first review stands. I still like mine !Original review  :This is a surprisingly good tablet. Nice bright and responsive screen very light weight and runs Windows 10 without any problems. (To install programs outside the Microsoft store you must cancel the "S" feature.) My niece is impressed with the tablet and is planning to get one for college instead of the laptop she had in mind  :-)  Would happily buy again.
5,Purchased for Windows to reflash car ECU.  Works as intended.
4,The Fusion5 Windows tablet PC was everything I expected. The touchscreen is easy to use and I liked the Cortana feature. The screen graphic quality is great. I am using the Fusion5 mostly to play games when I am away from home and it fits the bill perfectly. I am glad I made this purchase.
5,Purchased this unit to record data collection for another equipment app. Positives = turns on quickly - long battery life - good / bright screen quality - Apps load quickly. A great tablet and a great price. Very minor negative = screen for password entry could be more touch sensitive but maybe that’s me.
4,I bought this for a specific purpose - an application only available for Windows.  Internet browsing is sluggish and streaming video is not workable but for my purpose it works great.  I found it's a pretty nice e-reader.  And my son is starting to use it for online schooling - as an auxiliary device with a touchscreen.
5,Work was smart to implement a 'no personal use' policy on our computers but it meant I needed access to email and Office elsewhere. I wasn't feeling like buying a full computer as I didn't need it for much but the cost was high. I researched and nearly purchased one then thought hey what about a tablet. Eventually I found this one and based on other reviews decided to buy it. Another review here talks about things to go with it and yes I like the addition of the multi-USB port a bluetooth keyboard and a bluetooth mouse. For less than $260 total I have a super lightweight very functional computer. I haven't yet bought Office but it's working with Google Docs just fine. But the best part? It plays my favorite online game Toontown Rewritten. No it's not a gamer laptop but it can do this one thing that is my guilty pleasure. Very happy with my purchase.
4,I was expecting the display to be 10". But it's only 8 1/2". other then that it's ok.
5,It works well for my daughter. It is easy to use. She is using it for entertainment purposes. We have been able to put most of the apps we want on the tablet. I am happy with my purchase.
4,I am a technician and handle paperwork going into and coming out of service calls. In addition I use many different manuals and schematics in the performance of my duties. With the fusion I am able to carry manuals and paperwork in a convenient electronic package. I would have given the tablet 5 stars BUT Windows and Nook no longer have an agreement so I am unable to load my Nook books.
3,I purchased this to play games since FB Gameroom was leaving and I needed an upgraded tablet.  I also like to stream and when I streamed a movie via Britbox the sound was so poor I had to go up to 100 and the sound was still so faint I could hardly hear the movie and even when i used headphones it was so faint.  This was not a cheap tablet but I need something with sound and can play HD movies.  So I am disappointed in this product.
4,This is a good product for the price.  I got it specifically for use with a piano learning software to sit on my digital piano.  It works fairly well although some features there is a long lag time.  I'm wishing I opted for the 8GB RAM model.
4,Love the size
4,I have Samsung Android tablet but I was looking for easily portable windows based tablet. Within the given price point Fusion 5 Ultra Slim Windows Tablet is very handy for daily uses. I love that it has mini SD card with up to 128GB extra storage. Great visual & battery performance. Touch screen response is slow and sometime freezes. Need to be optimized/tailored for faster response as Windows tend to be heavy.I rated these 4 stars instead of 5 because of the relatively slower response.
5,This is the first tablet I've ever purchased. I wanted it for more "portability" instead of having to undock my laptop when wanting to go to a different room in my house. I also wanted a Windows tablet since that's what I've used my entire life and I didn't want to have to learn how to use an Apple or Android device. The best thing for me about this tablet was the price !!! So economical!!! I'm loving it!!!! Thanks Fusion5!!!
4,I bought this to use for running my shapeoko CNC router and to do basic internet and such on.  It is fantastic for these things.  It frees up my larger laptop with more horsepower to create the Gcode files and such.  I find the response a little slow but nothing to cry about and for the cost I am very excited.  I would buy again.  cheers
4,I bought this for my 10 year old to use for her online home school and the quality of the screen is really good the battery life is good as well. We've yet to have any issues with any of the apps or the tablet and I like it because it's like a windows desktop.
5,I wanted to replace a tablet that was on Amazon operating system at an economical price. I investigated this device as much as I could and purchased it. I have this set up identical to my Desktop and my Laptop. I keep it close to my chair and if I think of something I can handle it stay lazy and not have to get up to go to the other two computers. It's very handy not so heavy and just as fast as my other devices.
3,I initially gave this tablet a great review. Read below.As I used it further and installed Office 2013 and Nord VPN and Cisco Anyconnect I noticed it slowly became less responsive especially in web browsers.  After Windows updates it has gotten slower. I was using it earlier and walked away for 30 minutes and now it will not come out of hibernation no matter what I do to it.My initial review:The tablet runs Windows 10 which makes it versatile and easy to use. It is responsive and is light and small enough to take anywhere. This can easily replace a laptop. I see it as an inexpensive alternative to the Surface Pro which costs at least 5 times. I plan to add Office suite and Cisco VPN client so I can take it on trips.Getting the additional 64 Gigs of storage is definitely helpful.The case that came with it is well designed built however one of the corner straps seems to cover the power button which can lead to accidental powering off the device. Moving the strap to the side a little takes care of the problem.
5,For $200 I think performance is adequate or as one would expect.  It works great for my purposes.  I use it as a field computer for configuring other hardware devices in the field like flight controllers and motor controllers for radio controlled aircraft.  The full-sized USB port was one of the big selling features for me and the computing power is sufficient.Setup was easy and so far I've not had any issues.  I would recommend for similar purposes or perhaps students on a budget who need a Windows 10 device.
4,Had the tablet for some time at this point and it has worked well. Not the fastest but that is what you get for the price. Touch screen keyboard has some limitations so I will be adding a USB keyboard. Overall a good value.
5,Incredibly LA Fitness in Dallas prevents customers from viewing CNN on the overhead TV's for aerobic equipment such as treadmills steppers etc.  The reason given for this restriction is that viewing CNN does not contribute to the wellness of its customers.LA Fitness does offer free WiFi and I have successfully used it to view CNN on my Tablet PC.So LA Fitness's slogan of NO JUDGMENT really is untrue; they have judged that you will not view CNN in their facilities.  Luckily the Tablet PC allows you to skirt this censorship.
4,This tablet is very easy to work on.  It syncs up to your laptop or computer so that what is stored on your laptop/computer is available on the tablet.  The only thing I can say that I dislike is the charge.  It does drain very quickly when not using & do not have it plugged in.  But other than that I think it was a great buy for the money.
5,While the windows version that it brings does not allow to install non-appstore apps at the begginning the rest is working well and it just needed an update and a change in the windows store app to accept third-party programs. The tablet is relatively light and feels good as the rubber grips well enough to not need an additional case.The battery life seems adequate and it does run the program I intended to run (MIssion Planner)Will probably buy another one soon.
4,I DO like the tablet it does what I need and is a nice size. For the money it was a good deal for camera storage processor picture and RAM.  I got a few of the accessories that are made to go with it but am less impressed with THEM than the tablet itself an that does limit my ability and options for use of the 10.1 Fusion tablet.
4,I bought this item mainly for gaming purposes after 2 days I returned it. I was expecting it to be like a normal laptop but It's more for doing stuff for work and such. Overall if your not planning on mainly gaming it's a good tablet. That's why it's 4 stars.
5,Great tablet for the price and all the features that it has. Very pleased with it and would buy again
5,I was shopping for a tablet for some time and did a ton of research on prices/features/reviews and this is the one I settled on.  It came in the mail quite promptly and I was up and running within minutes.  It has a great feature to link to your pc account for easier shared information and I have no complaints about the product.  The screen looks great and the battery life is pretty solid if you fidget with the settings.  I mainly use it for browsing and some games but it has yet to disappoint.  I highly recommend this product.
4,The product so far seems good for the money. It fails in giving information about the features and products that come with it the user manual is below average. Since the manual is not what is purchased it is helpful though.
4,This is a decent cheap tablet.Windows 10 makes it easy to use and it runs pretty quick. I do not use it as a laptop but I did not want an android (used a Dell Venue Pro 8 before). Windows 10 comes with some advantages and disadvantages vs Android but they are easy to live with.positive:- known OS that can easily be changed for your needs- till now good battery life- good quality buildnegatives:- does not work with a combined wired headset with mic. (3.5mm 4 point jack)- low sound level when using built in speakers- lacking a light sensor for automatic brightness adjustmentoverall very good tablet for the price
5,Compact yet large enough. Everything I was looking for to complete my set up. Great product to use with my SLS ghost investigating camera.
4,Immediately noticed how reactive the touchscreen is! it is very precise and the screen graphics look great!  My only issues are that the battery doesn't last as long as advertised and I wish that it had come with a keyboard.  Battery issue is merely an inconvenience and tablet is well worth the money spent.  would definitely recommend.
4,It's speedy seems well built. I needed a tablet that I could carry easy this fit my needs.
4,It was inexpensive and does what i needed it to do.
3,Was looking for a cheap alternative the specs for this device were great but after having it for over a week and ample testing it’s really nothing to write home about I’ve constantly had some sort of issues it does lag there are a lot of settings I’ve had to tinker with to help this thing work better but if you are buying this to rely on stay far away it does play movies well and music and also iTunes seams to be working for me as well as some of the lighter apps for use it is nicer that you can do more than an android tablet but it’s not by a great margin it takes forever to charge and it will tend to get warm after a few hours of use
5,First of all I am not a techie so I did a lot of research and found the fusion 5 to have really good reviews.  I wanted an inexpensive tablet with Windows 10 to mainly use with my Cricut software since they no longer support Windows 7.  It came in two days.  I just got it yesterday so I can't comment on the battery life.  I needed to disable the S mode to download my Cricut software and had no trouble doing that.  I found the screen to be very clear and the touchscreen good too.  I was surprised at how user friendly Windows 10 was.  I had my software up and running in no time.  I am very happy with my purchase so far!
4,Using it for a CNC router.  Have not used it yet.  Bought it based on recommendations by users on u-tube.
5,My laptop crashed and I needed something fast portable and that also had the right requirements for my school work. This product has been amazing to me. I needed a computer almost over night and every one I looked at said I would get it within 1-2weeks. My Fusion 5 arrived in sufficient time for me to continue and finish my class assignments so that I would not have to drop a class or have incomplete work. THANK YOU!!
2,The cutout for front camera was not properly aligned with the display’s glass lamination effectively blocking more than half of the camera’s view. (See photo).  I first tried resolving this issue directly with the manufacturer but that effort failed so I had no choice to return this unit to the Amazon seller for a replacement. Hopefully the second one will be correctly assembled…TBD once the replacement arrives.
4,I have to use Windows 10 a lot for work and it definitely helps to have a spare Windows 10 device on-the-go. It's not that powerful and the build quality isn't the best but you can't beat the price!The body is made from plastic and tends to bend easily but it also has impressive battery life. I have yet to fully drain it the the power down to 0% with normal use. I just keep it plugged in while I'm not using it and had no other issues so far.The precision of the touch display is fairly low (which is to be expected at this price range) but it's manageable. Also paired to a Bluetooth keyboard/headphones with no problems.
5,This is a powerful little tablet. It has full Windows 10 and though it does start in S Mode it is easy to turn off when you attempt to download something outside the S safety zone (be sure if you do it that you get antivirus as you cannot turn S back on!). The battery life is good. It lasts for about 6 hours and arrives half charged. Fully customizable with the exact same settings as an actual laptop. Bluetooth keyboard I bought works great and mini HDMI converter nib I bought makes it easy to use a real HDMI cable with it. Great service so far and warranty was easy to register.
5,I love this tablet.  I wanted it for a back-up to my larger laptop and also to take it camping with some of my games on it.  That is why I wanted one that had Windows on it.  The only problem I found was that I had to order a cover with a keyboard because the virtual keyboard will not stay up when I need it (probably a windows problem rather than a tablet problem).  I solved that by ordering a cover with a keyboard in it.  I'm very happy with it!
3,Good looking screen. The touch was not easy even just to login
4,This is the second Fusion I bought through Amazon. I've been impressed with this tablet. It's easy to use lightweight and the performance has been solid. I enjoy the versatility of using it as a touchscreen or attaching the keyboard. It's great to have a more affordable alternative to the iPad and I think this product is just as good. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is only that sometimes there's a slight delay through the keyboard connection while typing but I expected that and remain pleased with the purchase.
5,We are using this tablet as a Time Clock terminal running a simple program. It is perfect. The responsiveness of the screen and the performance of the system overall is perfect. The battery time is awesome taking into account that windows is not so well optimize for saving battery. For our purpose is complete it has camera to take pictures every time an employee clock in it has a good battery just in case the power goes down wifi for connectivity. I added a usb dongle with extra usb ports and also an ethernet port for better connection. We plan to buy more to expand our terminals around the factory.
1,Other reviews said the same things I'm about to say but there were a lot that didn't. I should have given more credit to the negative reviews.1) TERRIBLE connectivity: I was sitting LITERALLY right next to the router/modem and it still couldn't find my home network. It could find the neighbors' just fine but not mine.2) touch screen has terrible accuracy. I would have to double-tap an icon multiple times in different places to get a "hit".3) touch screen also had terrible sensitivity. Sometimes it would take a minute or more of trying before it would register. Big giant button didn't matter still took forever.4) super slow: typing was a nightmare because of sensitivity but also because anything you typed would take forever to show up; you had to wait to see how badly the typing was mangled backspace to fix wait for that to register fix wait check again etc. A short sentence that took a second to type would take a couple minutes to correct / validate.It was super annoying and I scheduled a repair - which I would have to send at my own expense. Before I was able to send it I got a blue screen of death - it died fully and would not reboot. It was a cycle of restart wait an hour for loading get tired of it and restart get blue screen asking for me to click on restart button that wouldn't register so after a couple minutes of trying would hard reboot again. And then I was back at the loading screen for a long time (didn't wait an hour after that first time) hard restarted blue screen. Load restart blue restart ad infinitum.Ultimately returned for refund. Don't waste your time - select something more reliable.
4,it  very  nice and easy  to  get started  it  fast  and  easy to  navigate on  the screen  well  worth the  cost  for  a back up  to  my  home computer
4,Just got this in mail today. it powers up and works as it should.
4,I really like the Fusion 5.  Lots of frill for the price.  Just one major design flaw.  The on/off button is in a location that makes it impossible to put in a case with accidentally turning it off.  Also the speaker is weak. Other then that Good product.
5,I liked everything about it. It was easy to set up and it had all of the items on it from the start that I needed to use. I will be adding other apps as I go along but I see no problem in doing that the Microsoft store has all of what I need. I'm looking forward to using the portability this tablet gives me and not having to drag my large laptop along on vacations and trips.
4,I’ve only had this for a few days but I like it so far. I bought it mostly for storing PDF service manuals on in the shop. It’s handy being able to just take the tablet to the vehicle and not have to print off a page and take it. I always need several parts of the manual so it’s really handy. I have a Windows 10 computer so it’s easy to tranfer files. I put some songs on it to try on my Bluetooth speaker there. Not sure about the battery yet. The speaker is “tinny” sounding but that’s okay for me. I’ll try to update this after I’ve used it for awhile
5,I spent a lot of time looking for a tablet with specifications that met my needs while also being within my budget and I think this was the perfect choice! I haven't used it much yet I bought it for a specific purpose that I haven't really been able to do but it works as expected. There isn't much more I can say- if I have a problem I will write an update! Also I got a docking keyboard/case that works perfectly with it. I am really excited to use this while traveling!
4,Just so easy to sync with my laptop & PC.Might not be the best Windows Tablet but is all most people need at a great price!
5,I have only had this tablet for a week but as a 73 year old female I found it easy to set up and use. It is a terrific PC for the price and it is replacing a failing laptop that  is not a touchscreen.  It runs fairly quickly and so far is meeting most of my needs. The only thing I have not been unable to do. is download a Kindle app in order to read  my books . An additional thing I would like is to be able to enlarge the screen with a simple pinch of the touch screen. I am very happy with the purchase and would recommend it for anyone needing an easy to use tablet.
4,I am using this as a PC for basic spreadsheet and word type stuff...had it a couple weeks now. Battery lasts I have no problems video chatting speakers are good. I personally like the power cord being the older plug in type (closer to a headphone jack). Also it arrived earlier than expected which rocks.
4,Product is as advertised so far.  Not in a place with internet connection at moment so limited review but a quick run through the operating system seems fine.
4,I have no complaints with this product so far having owned it for only three days. I am having difficulty in ripping CD's off a CD writer. But that is probably because of my inept  knowledge of such new devices  at my age of 75.  I believe I must recruit my neighbor's child who is in his teenage years to educate me. Then all should be well I pray.
5,I received this tablet just this past week and while I'm still investigating all the bells and whistles I have to say I'm very impressed and pleased with the product and its ease of use. When I purchased this tablet I was looking for something at a reasonable price that had more memory and storage space than the tablet I've had for three years and that came with a Windows operating system. I found both of my needs supplied with this tablet. The $199 price was great compared with other tablets some of which didn't match up to this one and it comes with a Windows operating system.  I'd recommend this product to anyone who's looking for a good tablet at an affordable price. It has a 12 month limited warranty included.
4,Item exceeds expectaions.
4,I really enjoy this fusion5 tablet pc.i bought it because it was a good price and it had everything that I need it. The only thing I could not find a good screen protector to fit it right
5,I needed the ability to use Windows 10. I have my iPhone that I can do most things I need. But I've run into many times when I need to be on a Windows operating system. I had been using an old slow laptop. This Fusion 5 has been excellent for my needs. At this price point It's everything I could expect.I would highly recommend getting a case with the keyboard. There isn't much to chose from out there (yet).
4,Impressed with both the speed and video quality.  I added a 128 GB SD card for more storage and have been able to play movies from there.I noticed that when plugged into the USB power source it still runs the battery down while in use and will only charge while off.  Maybe USB does not have enough power to play and charge at the same time.I have connected it to a flat panel through the USB connection and the sound and video are good.  Though as others have stated the sound from the tablet speakers are very poor.
5,The speed of delivery was impressive. I have been in the computer industry since the mid 1980's. I am a picky customer as I was a CEO of an engineering company. I just needed an inexpensive tablet for my wife's long arm machine. We liked it so much we kept this one and sold the more expensive one already had. There have been zero issues with the tablet since purchased in November.
3,Tablet arrived as promised in great condition and free of bloatware.  Set-up was easy and was up and running in no time.  Quality feel lightweight and ideal for my needs (simple tasks such as web surfing and minor document work).  I have not used it for heavy-duty computing or gaming (which I don't plan to) so I cannot speak to how well the memory or processor holds up for that type of use - but it has operated flawlessly for my needs.  Only a few weeks in but I'm very pleased thus far.
4,I order this tablet the 1st one came with a screen defect. It was replaced within 4 days. The tablet does what I expected it to do which is run a vst synth and midi keyboard.
4,I received the product in a timely manner. Plenty of clear and understandable instructions provided. My second day of use and no real complaints. The product has a very clean and appealing design. I like the fact it is a lite weight machine that provides Windows OS
4,Overall it's a decent tablet PC for the price and what I need.  I'm currently in school and I usually use it to write my papers.  It's convenient to carry it around while I'm on the go.
4,I bought this tablet for my 85 year old aunt. I did all the set up with little issue. The issues I did have were mostly my lack of knowledge. The owners manual was very broad in explanations in some areas. However I think we got it. I liked it very much and hope she does too!
5,I’m a dedicated Apple user but for some health technology for my business it required a windows operating system. I chose to buy this tablet because it has a USB port(which I needed) and a mini USB port.  After a 2 day update yes it took that long it runs perfectly.  The touch screen is a little slow compared to apple but it’s ok just takes time learning how sensitive or slow it is.  The battery is good for my use. The colors and screen are nice.  It’s light weight and the perfect size.  You can charge it via mini usb or with the ac cord.  I would recommend this for anyone needing a windows tablet.
5,Delivery was fast.  My wife likes the windows operating system over the android. So this windows 10 table was exactly what I needed. The full size USB port is nice. It allowed me to add a USB ethernet adapter so don't have to use WIF except when on the road. This eliminates slow downloads and buffering. I also got a mini HDMI cable so we  can send to the video to a large screen TV. I mainly use it to stream from Dish Anywhere Amazon Prime Video & Netflix.
5,I ordered this Fusion5 tablet mostly to use to read books. I could not get it to download the kindle app. Had to take it to Office Max to get it to download the app. He had to take it out of windows s so that it would work. Everything works great now. Very happy with my purchase so far. Was quick shipping also.
1,I was initially impressed with this tablet as it seemed to have decent performance and a touchscreen for a reasonable price.  Fast forward 4 months and it would no longer power on.  Contacted support since it is stated to have a 1 year warranty.  Prompt response with instructions to ship the unit back for review at my own cost.  Many warranties are like this so while disappointed I was not surprised.  I paid $26.07 to have it packaged securely and shipped.  Within a week I received what appears to be the exact same tablet and power supply back.  No issue there until 5 minutes into the Windows setup the screen when black and exhibited the exact same behavior as before.  I contacted support they gave me two things to try.  One worked to get the screen back on for about 90 seconds then back to black.  Contacted support for the 3rd time received the same form letter about returning it.  I don't think I should have to pay yet again to return this device and have asked them to provide a call tag or shipping authorization since I believe this is their issue.
5,very quick delivery notepad works great
4,This tablet is easy to set up and easy to use.  I would recommend this tablet to anyone looking for a non-expensive but great product. I love it so much that I even bought an extra one for my wife.Great value awesome experience
3,This is a good tablet however the charger that comes with it makes no sense. I am a very tech savvy person and I can not figure it out. The charger is magnetic but did not come with any adapter?? Its very frustrating since I need it for work and now I have to buy a new charger...
4,I got this tablet for my wife as a Christmas present. I was looking for a simple to configure and use tablet for her to read audio books and listen to music while she commutes back and forth too work. This tablet fits the bill perfectly. The screen is good and large with excellent clarity and is perfect for what she wanted it for.
5,I needed a windows tablet to run the automation on a quilting machine. I ordered this one!  I didn't know that it would arrive in windows 10 "s mode".  There are directions to turn this off but it seems it's a one way road and you can't go back to S mode.  Ok fine because I'll be using the tablet only for my machine.The tablet works well! I recommend it if you need a tablet with windows!
4,After 30 yrs of Win laptop desktop usage this was first Win10 tablet. Advantages: convenient for travel simple for browsing long battery life USB slot is absolutely necessary grandkids like playing games and screen quality highly acceptable. My experience challenges: touch screen precision using stylus required multiple attempts finger precision touch was better-but fat fingers engaged multiple actions and I've decided to get a BT keyboard/mouse. I will continue using laptop for business transactions IT courses and DVD video player. Its a fairly good value and Im sure with time I will grow accustomed to touch screen functions.
4,Solid product processes a little slower than I would like. If you want to use office make sure you have a 365 subscription. Whiteboard function. Is nice functions more like a computer than a tablet.
4,I am happy with this tablet it is light and easy to set up and handle. The touch screen is good but for me it is better to work with the keyboard + mouse pad accesory. My only complaint is that it is a little slow when using web browsers. I have compared opening a page with my phone (using wifi) and with the tablet and the tablet takes a bit longer to load and go to the links. I am thinking it is windows 10 issue so I will research to customize and kill some processes to see if it can be faster.
5,The Fusion 5 has the same capabilities as a standard desktop or laptop. Software usage is not restricted to Windows OS products. Other types of technology such as Android and its software can also be integrated with Fusion 5 and perform without incompatibility issues. In today's world integration of various types of technology is beneficial for productivity.
4,I bought this tablet to replace one that had recently crashed after an update (different brand).  This product seems to be a little more user-friendly and easier to use.  The keyboard that goes with it does take a little getting used to and the performance of the tablet is a little slower than I expected but overall it works well and I have not had any issues with it.
5,Have always used Microsoft products and really enjoy Windows 10 operating system. This is the perfect size and priced tablet for my needs- emailing searching the web reading my e-newspaper and streaming on my Slingbox App  or Netflix and Amazon Prime accounts.  I had to disable the S Mode so that I could get the full functionality of Window's Defender as I was not able to download security updates. Ran the trouble shooter to fix a problem with Microsoft Store not opening. Fixed both problems easily . It has a nice screen that is sensitive to the touch and excellent resolution. Very happy with this purchase.
5,i got the 4GB RAM/64GB storage option and was very pleasantly surprised with the performance -- very fast with plenty of free storage.  i was able to install all my regular software that i use on my desktop with no problems at all.  basically i was looking for something i could use as an alternative to my laptop when in "couch potato" mode -- i found the laptop to be rather clumsy compared to my Android tablet.  but the problem with the Android tablet was that all the apps are incredibly dumbed down and don't give me near the power and functionality that my laptop does.  so this windows tablet was the answer -- and it works perfectly.  everything i have on my Windows desktop but with the tablet form factor.
4,There was a delay on most of the touch I did. Otherwise I would give 5 Stars. The battery indicator drops about a quarter for using just less than half an hour.
4,Nice windows tablet.  Clear bright screen. Sound is not very loud but it's to be expected.  Good for web surfing youtube videos play well. Does everything i need.
4,Definitely not a fast tablet but that's what you get at this price I suppose. Crystal clear screen and good size and weight. Will be mounting it somewhere in my kitchen for easy access to recipes.
5,I decided to get a cheap windows tablet as an early Christmas present and found this on Amazon. It's perfect for when I am in bed or at the airport and is great for when I just need to do something quickly. I don't do any gaming or intensive development work on this computer so I use it for entertainment or surfing the web. The quality is overall very good. The only minor complaint is the battery power which tends to run out a bit quicker than I would like. Regardless I would highly recommend this! 5 stars!
4,I was worried when I opened the Amazon box to find the fusion box falling apart but thankfully the fusion was ok and so far no issues battery is good the and I was able to install the programs I needed with no issue
5,I orginally purchased this for someone else as I thought I didn't need it. Then when it arrived and I started to set it up I decided to keep it. I'm glad I did. Having a tablet gives me the portability of a laptop without the expense. Using a smart phone for a computer all the time is just hard on the eyes.
4,Good basic device.
5,I utilize this device for OBD software and automotive analysis.  It could not be more perfect and portable.  The operations is easy system is compatible  and fast.  it is the perfect tablet device for compatibility with 3rd party software which requires windows in a small package with long battery life.
4,this product meets all my needs.  opening Windows is faster which I really like.
5,Nice display. Fast processor.
5,Product arrived quickly in the middle of COVID-19 shipping delays.  It was packaged safely and came with all the cords and manuals.  Took me about 30 minutes to start Win10 and configure my settings.  So far I'm pleased with the product.  Battery level was 3/4 full.  I haven't had to charge it yet.  Speeds are pretty good for a tablet and the screen refresh is fast when changing viewing angles.  The virtual keyboard is quick and responsive.Looks like a good product at a good price.
5,Having become tired of my iPad limitations it’s refreshing to use my Fusion 5 Windows 10 tablet with all the familiar functions and features of my PC. The ability to sync with all devices is grand with my data available on anywhere. The expansion features are welcome features. Overall a very impressive effective and  and useful tablet.
5,For $200 this thing is great for watching netflix/hulu/prime in bed while traveling or for grumpy kids in the backseat(I would never but some parents might...). So far the battery lasts for 2-3 hours if it is used constantly. I've also started using it at work for checking emails and viewing word excel or pdf docs when not at my desk and it makes it through an 8 hr day without charging. Great for the money would recommend.
4,Purchased the Fusion 5 to help our sons keep up with school during break and over the summer. This is a nice tablet at a great price. This device had more RAM a better processor and better connectivity that the other options we looked at. Good for both school work and entertainment.
4,It is a nice Windows 10 tablet - I just wish the wireless card were a little stronger as I have an unstable connection just one floor up from the internet modem.
4,I purchased this to take back and forth between summer and winter homes. Very compact light portable. Easy to set up easy to use.
5,I am using these for dedicated real time data displays for diesel engines. 4 GB RAM makes updates more reliable. Everything else is fine.  I am using a BT Mouse as well.  These are very nice PCs.Fusion5 Customer service is very good as well.
5,Touch screen.  Clear screen and good battery 🔋All are good really enjoy
5,My old tablet died but I could not afford to buy anything too expensive.  I found this gem while on the hunt and I am glad I picked it.  It has a good quality screen resolution I have watched several movies an shows and was not at all diappointed with the color quality.  I also like that it has Windows installed what a great feature to have at such a low price.  I don't really play many games but the ones I have worked well.  I also use this to store my crocheting project instructions again I have nothing bad to say.  Overall if you want a great tablet at a low price look no further.
5,Works well good value for a Windows tablet. Technical support is excellent should a repair be needed.
4,So far I'm satisfied with the tablet but that could change since hardware/software can act buggy several weeks after purchase.  For the price though it works well for what I bought it for : a second monitor to read chat during my Streams.UPDATE:  It's been working quite well it takes a minute to boot up but for the price I'd say it's worth it!
5,Purchase this tablet to run the software for my CNC machine . Works great. I  needed something that didn't have a cooling fan due to all the wood dust created by my CNC. I was glade that it was already on Windows 10 home version. The touch screen work well and the resolution is good.
1,Well I've used this thing about 12 times since I bought just over a year ago. Last time i used it was in May 2021. I turned it on this month and for some reason the USB input was not responding or working at all. I contacted Fusion5 and they recommended I reset and reinstall windows. I did so it took an entire day for it to do this it's very slow. Well that did not work and now I have a useless tablet. I bought this tablet specifically for using the USB input with an automotive application but now its useless. They refuse to help and suddenly speaking to their help via email has turned into a broken english/possibly poorly translated transaction but they refuse to help without receiving money up front. They want over $30 for me to send it there and once they have it they will tell me what it will cost to "repair". HORRENDOUS....spend your money elsewhere.My old review: Windows 10 in a tablet is an expensive proposition...unless you buy a Fusion5! Their pricing is great and undercuts the competition. Features and processor may not match a $500 machine but for $200 it's the best on the market. I would recommend this for someone interested in a computer than can accomplish tasks but not heavy RAM usage applications especially more than one at once.
4,I wanted a simple Windows 10 device for basic use and this tablet was great value for money and gave me what I needed.
5,I've had 2 other more expensive windows tablets and this one is just as good as those. I'm going to use this to take to my classes instead of my laptop and the size is perfect for fitting inside my bag but still has all the things my laptop does. I love it!
4,For the price it is a good product. The display resolution is not as good as the higher priced tablets. It is also a bit slow and not as responsive. i just got this product a few weeks ago still not sure how long it will work properly. So far so good.
5,I have been working on fixing selling and managing computer systems for 25 years. This tablet is an outstanding value I actually purchased a second one. Good battery life excellent speed and good screen quality - for what this is supposed to be it isn't a gaming system.  But it runs MS office very well streams movies etc. It is excellent for every-day use... with ONE exception - the internal speakers on this are terrible.  Still has a good sound card and bluetooth so just use an external speaker or headphones.  Also the ability to charge either with the power adapter or via the micro-usb port is a big bonus - one less thing to bring when traveling.  Overall - outstanding buy.
5,this is the third one i ordered from Amazon.  i sent the other two back because of wrong description  The size  listed  11 x8 x1.5  well the screen size is 10 x 7.  setting that aside i love it.  it comes with windows 10.it starts up quickly.  setting it up was simple.  i  like voice control.  i just got it and i will write another review after a week or so of use.  i highly recommend it for BO ZOS like me.  Arthur
4,I really like this labtop but a few things are driving me mad. the full screen will randomly shrink down to the minimize screen or a small screen as in all the time. Also It will randomly start typing in the middle of the page everytime I start typing anything. but like I said I just got it and maybe it is just getting used to it but it happened 18x just writing this review
4,Like the tablet but not able to download my apps I like and was the reason I purchased the tablet.
5,This product is very good I usually has everything I have had no issues with it performed way better than I even thought it would. I originally got it because of the price oh it is hard to find a tablet that uses windows 10 for that good of a price I also bought a keyboard that connects to it as well. They look really good together
5,This was exactly what I needed it I needed a windows 10 tablet and the specs for this tablet are above and beyond the cost.  For the money you can’t beat it. I needed this device as a component of a structured light system camera  System I was building  that I needed for paranormal investigation. I took it out into the field for the first time shortly after receiving it and I was very impressed with his performance. I also bought This last minute as I need it for an out-of-town investigation I was going to. I was hoping it would arrive in time and after contacting the seller they got it to me fast which I was very happy about.
2,It's definitely a bit slow not sure why but it's definitely a nice tablet better than most I've had. But was contacted and was told I would be receiving a free gift well that hasn’t come yet…..guess they will promise anything for a five star rating….
4,I used this tablet for virtual meetings and to use Microsoft word for word processing
4,This is a really nice way to have a computer in the size of a tablet. I bought this to run my CNC machine!
5,This is a great tablet in the under $200 range. The speed of the unit is good and it is has ample storage plus it accepts up to 128 Gb card for additional storage. I was able to surf the web without any lag compared to my other units an (Android and Apple) this tablet wins hands down compared to those two. It has a nice display screen and is a nice weight for mobility. As with most Windows tablets the windows updates will eventually eat into the 64 Gb storage but usually can be remedied with a fresh install of windows but i haven't looked for the drivers yet to complete that when necessary.  All in all you can't go wrong with this tablet.
4,Touch screen works great. Battery runs about half a day if on it the whole time. Screen quality is not bad.
4,I recieved this with a bubble in the screen but the seal was already broken (I think it was an amazon issue not a Fusion issue) it feels well made and responds quick. I also got the associated keyboard and that seems to work well.
5,I like the fact that there is no fan to suck in dust and particles of wood. The touch screen makes it easy to load programs.
4,Dislike how the battery dies quicklyUsed for school
5,This tablet is really good for the money. I bought it to use in my workshop mainly to run a CNC machine. I expected it to be pretty unimpressive. After playing around with it for a bit I found it to be very responsive and able to run any program I threw at it (within reason).
5,Fusion out did themselves on this unit great screen quality and intel gen 8 chip on gpu with 6 hour battery life you can make the most of this thin light weight tablet with smooth touchscreen.  Fast quad core intel x5 processor and 64gb storage with 4gb memory double what most units have.  Dual cameras and sd card expansion meets all your needs.  What is really nice is it has all the ports full size usb 3 and then bluetooth with mini usb and hdmi to boot.  You will love this unit and they give you one drive cloud storage as a added bonus.
4,This is a great value tablet and the windows software makes it feel like more of a small laptop. The screen quality is fantastic and the battery life is great - most recently tested on a flight on which we watched a two-hour movie and still had 75% battery. The only flaw so far is a slightly finicky touch screen.
4,I work at an auto repair facility and I have to say that this tablet is well worth the money.  With the Windows 10 operating system it allows us to access our conversion manufacturers interfaces and perform diagnostics.  If you don't have a budget great tool to have!
5,The Boss wanted Surface-type PC tablets for portability but didn't budget enough for four Surfaces let alone one so I got four of these instead and they work just fine; I was impressed enough to buy one for myself. Drop in a microSD card and you've got decent storage; the box says there is a 128GB limit but I am using a 256GB without any issues. I just picked up a Logi Bluetooth keyboard (it's the chunky one with the yellow slot); it paired almost instantly and fits well in the tablet slot. Not really needing my iPad anymore but don't know about durability or longevity so can't put away the iPad just yet.
5,I wanted a small version of my Windows 10 laptop for traveling and this is it!  It was easy to set up with the same Office 365 I use on my laptop.  I've tested various devices on it and they are all recognized so far.  There's not a lot of disc space but you can use thumb and SD cards with it.  Also unlike Chromebook there is actual disk space on the device.  I hate when my stuff is in the Cloud though you have the option of putting it there.  Don't know yet about battery life but I've only charged it once.  Glad I bought it!
5,My requirement for a Windows system with a touch screen and USB port made this computer perfect for me.
5,I've had the tablet for a week and it's perfect for my needs. It's hard to find a tablet with a 3.0 USB port so this was the driving force in my purchase. The battery life isn't quite as advertised but neither is MPG on a car The screen quality is more than satisfactory and the processing speed is fine. It's not laptop speed but good for this kind of product.
5,I have an hour commute by public transport.  I use the fusion5 for light games and browsing/reading while on my way to work.  Boot time load time application start time are all reasonable and it works well for light application use.  I also slice 3d prints on it while on my way home.  While the ram limitation increases the time and leads to some delay when inspecting  the 3d models form factor weight and price make me very happy.  Overall great product that meets my needs.
3,But for now combine with the Amazon 7 fire it will work for now the first day I got it was giving me problems and another thing it is some type of glitch with getting WIfi so I'm still working on the issue to make sure I'm not at fault but I won't recommend it for school or business work its more media consumption lite surfing on the web .ITS NOT A WINDOWS SURFACE AND IT WILL NOT PERFORM LIKE MICROSOFT  SURFACE.Its a cheap tablet not top quality.
5,This tablet is the perfect size! This is the second one I've purchased. My fiance dropped the first one and the screen cracked. We sent it in to be repaired but the couldn't repair it. They credited my Amazon account for the amounr it was purchased. I bought this one second time buying. I got him a case and laptop bag also. I encourage customers to purchase the waranty/insurance nd a case as well..
4,We wanted windows tablet so that we can take photos and upload it to network workstations in our office network. There are not that many choices out there besides surface brands which are expensive. This one had good reviews so ordered it. Today is the first day of use. It's little bit slow but considering a tablet running full windows it's expected. So far so good. Hopefully will last long. Fingers crossed.
4,Great product. This tablet computer done right. Many tablet computers have screen formating problems. I was using an Ipad and a couple of another android tablets and they all had formating problems. My son who is a data base manager. He explained why I was having problems.
5,I have never been a tablet person. I prefer a laptop any day. As a systems integrator I travel quite often. During these times I have to carry a laptop through airports and plug it around the city I happen to be in for work. I also am a youth minister. I really wanted a tablet to use for my sermon notes. The fusion 5 is a power house that allows portability from laptop to tablet. I love being able to use the tablet as I wait for flights or in flight entertainment. The price is more than affordable and the Fusion5 is worth every penny. For those tech people I am also able to port my Linux mint pen drive with this awesome tablet
5,My husband wanted a windows based tablet to play his games on that was portable. Outside of it not working at the moment it has been GREAT. We are very pleased with this product
4,I accidently removed the screen protector thinking it was packing material.  Oops! I wish it would have been marked Do not remove.
4,I bought it for my tech challenged spouse. It would have been easier if it came preloaded with all his favorites
5,I bought this to run some Silverleaf software for my motorhome.  Just the right size to mount on the dashboard and seems to work fine.  It has the required USB-A port (full size USB port) that is needed with the Silverleaf hardware adapters to read from the OBD port on the motorhome.  Glad I chose it.
4,Good value.  Windows 10 home easy to use and familiar.  Not a big learning curve to start using.  Many functions of a larger laptop.  Would definitely buy again.
5,There are questions about a screen protector installed and mine seems to have one included. I tried to take a picture of the corner of the tablet showing the line of what looks like the edge of the screen protector.  I purchased this tablet for my husband to use in viewing his Trailcamera videos and pictures. I wanted a tablet with Windows so he would be familiar with the same program he used on my laptop. He also loves watching hunting videos on YouTube.. On this tablet I increased the size of the print purchased a USB card reader set up a few shortcuts on the desktop and so far everything is working great!
5,I use this tablet as a companion to my primary station for traveling meetings and public speaking. The battery lasts a fairly long time when I'm using it but drains more rapidly than expected on standby. There is some lag on cloud-based interfaces and online page loading but all home-based apps are zippy. This tablet is easy to carry around and has a sturdy construction. I've recommended it to a lot of people as it does turn eyes when I have it out and am using it. One downside is that the driver/setting controls for usb keyboard mouse etc. are very limited which leads to some frustrations when using hardware--even hardware made specifically for this machine.
5,I needed this tablet to replace a windows laptop for controlling CNC router. The touch screen is perfect for the software I use for adjusting the position of the cutter when I am running a job. It also frees up the laptop I was using for other things.It's the perfect size to use as a controller for this application--and the price makes getting a full-function tablet PC for this use case worthwhile.Very happy.
5,I purchased this as a gift and set it up for the recipient before giving it. The operating system was easy to bring up to date and use although I had never found one requiring a pin code for operation before this one.  Everything worked! It is fast and has adequate battery light weight with a responsive touch screen.  For the price it appears to be a great alternative to more expensive tablets running Windows 10.  The memory is sufficient but I added a 64gb sd card for data (room for larger).  I will probably get one for myself when my current tablet is in need of replacement.
5,I really like it.  It's like a handheld PC.  The screen sensitivity is on point.  Battery life average but won't disappoint you.  I purchased one to play games on.  You will definitely need a Micro SD card with 128 GB if you plan to download games.
4,Windows 10 Fusion5 FWIN232 PLUS S1Great price for full-size USB 3.0 portBluetooth 4.012 MONTHS OF FULL USA WARRANTY So far very satisfiedgreat product thanks again
3,It quit working all together after just three months. We use it at the Legion for our member information  board.subpar product.
5,My use may be different from others however I Storm Chase It runs my favorite software Gibson Ridge 3 for radar imagery. I use it in my vehicle and I love it. Bought the silicone universal sleeve for it to and its it great. Been very stable n no issues nice long battery life as well. No more having to set up bulky lap top computers in my truck now i teliable tablet that uses much less power! win win.This is a great windows tablet once you get all the windows updates done. Stable no crashes.
5,I had a Dell 11" laptop that I bought last year about this time ($350.00) that was to slow and while Dell thought it served as a tablet I thought it  was not a good tablet or laptop. So I replaced it with this tablet.  While I have only had it a short time I am very pleased with what I got.  This one does have a screen protector installed with no bubbles the battery charger charges Windows 10 works the sd card works.  In short it is as advertised and then some! Would highly recommend it and if my opinion changes I will say so.
5,I was actually surprised by this windows tablet I have tried a couple of others windows tablet out there around the same price range and most was not usable. Long load times or just lags really bad. Don't get me wrong this is no microsoft surface pro (price or performance) but for the price it's well worth it to me. I can run all my windows program without any issues. Battery is great lasts about 6 hour on continuous use in performance mode.
5,The fusion 5 windows 10 tablet is a great product at an affordable price. It has a Quad-core processor allowing for a very fast performance. In addition the Fusion 5 has an excellent battery life a vibrant bright colorful display and a sleek design.  It is also very lightweight making it extremely portable and easily accessible The Bluetooth also allows for easy pairing of peripheral such as keyboards and mouse/trackballs. Overall and wonderful and very functional windows 10 tablet with great customer service. They stand behind their product and offer a 1yr warranty. I would definitely recommend the fusion 5 for anyone especially those who want an alternative to the Surface Pro.
4,Picture is good nice little tablet.  The sound is not good but i use my bluetooth speaker with it so it works out.
5,I don't demand much from this tablet; it's in the kitchen mostly for recipes so I can't rate it on everything.  I regularly plug it in so I don't know how the battery life is. So far I'm pleased with it. I do wish the frame weren't so wide; there's about a half inch on each side of the frame adding to its overall size but on the whole that doesn't matter.
5,College prof here - I bought this tablet to help me keep up with grading and discussions on the go. So far it is working out very well. I am pleased with the performance and the ease it blends with my microsoft accounts to keep everything synched.
4,To run my terminator x on my Ls Camaro
5,So i looked around quite  a bit before choosing this particular tab and i have to admit bang for buck is a thing! the display is lovely the tab is pretty impressive for the price as well and speed is relative for the use by a 5yr old online classes. I paired this to a bluetooth keyboard and boom pocket friendly pc.
1,I bought this in early February and I got it near the end of the month its a nice tablet it's very functional. I use it for school to view ebooks and other digital mediums. Since it's Windows 10 I can link it to my other 3 PCs so highly convenient. Though easter weekend something weird happened to the screen it like the liquid crystals ruptured. So now it permanently has a stain on the screen. When its on its less visible but albeit an inconvenience. Also I noticed that when I first got it the battery life was great I could keep it idle over a day and I could pick up where I left off. Now since June the tablet will die in sleep mode after about 4 hours and it doesnt have a hibernate option so I'm forced to either keep it plugged in....I do not recommend this period getting ahold of customer service to get the screen repaired is an absolute nightmare. At the moment i'd like to give this zero stars since the screen went out within two months of barely using it.
5,Shipping time was good. Delivered on time. No issues on delivery. Price was fair and reasonable. Products are brand new in box with instructions. Setup was step by step. I did have to install windows updates. Tablets were in S mode as most tablets are. For my purposes I had to disable S mode which wasn’t difficult when using the option from the Microsoft store. Tablets run reasonably fast with no issues.
3,Shipped and received promptly.  Set up was easy as was product registration.  Fusion 5 sent welcome emails and encouraged contact with questions or issues.  Have added the 128g memory case and stylus and will add ear buds screen protector and keyboard.  The only rap is that the boot time is a little bit long but that's a Windows issue not Fusion 5.  All in all very good product and would recommend if you're in the market for an entry priced tablet PC.  Update after a year.  Dropped 2 stars because the usb charging plug constantly falls out of the charging port.  Virtually no friction to hold it in.
4,I like it fine.  I use it for facebook email and browsing the web
5,I’m a 79 year old man. I was looking for a way to get info from the internet when I’m sitting outside on the patio. I wanted a tablet reasonable priced that for a Senior was easy to use. I also got a no glare screen. So I can sit outside watch the news and Netflix and enjoy my tablet.It’s really great and helps this old an enjoy his time.
4,Great tablet for low power work. Great for students and can connect to almost any usb device. Touchscreen is decent and responsive and internet is fast regarding.
4,This is a very nice tablet which functions as a full PC. I purchased this for an older adult who needed a tablet that could easily be handled while relaxing in an armchair free of the weight of a laptop. The price is good too; forget getting an android tablet! This tablet is great for games reading watching streamed movies etc.  It's responsive and speed is good. I use it in the kitchen to follow recipes and watch movies while cooking.
5,I purchased this tablet to take on a month's vacation to the beach.  I had a software?  issue after about 3 weeks. The on screen keyboard would not come up. After doing all of the work- arounds  and repair advice on You-tube. I gave up and called Amazon.  They put me in contact with Fusion. After explaining the problem they shipped a new replacement and it was at my house waiting for me when I returned home. This is Great customer service and very rare these days.
4,I use this tablet for reading ebooks email reading news and sports and general web browsing. I've had good experiences with 8" Win 10 tablets for work and home use and this one is also well suited for general use. I would buy it again and recommend it to others looking for a functional relatively inexpensive tablet.
5,I brought this to demonstrate a Audio Visual product software that needs a PC to run. Obviously it’s not lightning fast but it worked quite well for my demos and the battery lasted an 8 hour day. I’ll probably buy more for other demo kits.
5,Great product will add the keyboard for sure. Nice bright display bit of a learning curve with WIN 10 but getting with it OK! Having some problem with the camera app but sure it will be an easy fix. Ordering the stylus package also as my fingers are too big!
4,This is a nice tablet. The setup is simple and the support has been helpful.
5,I like the ease of setting the unit up and it's capabilities. I bought it so I could use it with my CNC machine. It's nice because it doesn't have a keyboard to get covered in saw dust. I am using the blue tooth function so I can use my  Rii i4 Mini Bluetooth Keyboard with Touchpad to control my CNC machine
3,Using it for X32 Compact Digital Mixing Control Surface
3,For those of you asking "How does Windows 10 run on 4 GB of RAM" let me settle that now. It doesn't.Also be warned. Fusion 5 buys good reviews by giving accessories in exchange. Take the glowing reviews with a grain of salt.Look it's a cheap tablet running the biggest resource hog of an OS there is. Everything is slow. Opening a file window or a Web browser or really any basic task flows like molasses in January. And that's if you only have one window open. Don't try to multitasking on this thing. If you want a Web browser music player and / or ebook reader this is fine. But that's about it. But you can probably do better for the money.
4,Great product for the price.  using it just to run a 3D software and works perfectly with no lag
4,Fast..good price point for win 10 tab! Wish screen was harder material but was okay. Good vivid color etc! Would recommemd! Sound is good. Battery life good!
4,I like that I can take it anywhere I can use it for work or my son can play games an watch movies on a good size screen. Everything runs great but the battery life could be better i have to charge it way to much.
4,Excellent product at a reasonable price.  After several searches and short listing this tablet won my approval.  I  was not disappointed.
4,I purchased this for our office to use for online leases and one web-based POS system. It gets the job done but can be very slow when opening internet pages. I purchased two tablets and one was not charging so I exchanged it for a replacement and have not had charging issues with either since.
5,Packaged nicely. Start up and initial set up was easy and straight forward. All features appear to work well. Nice addition to my mobile office.
4,I use this thing for basic computing stuff. For that it's great. It can play hearthstone with a little bit of choppiness. I accidentally dropped it once and the back started to pop off pretty easily. But it didnt break. I like it. If your not trying to for out for a surface and just need the PC for basic PC stuff this is a good PC.
1,The supplied charger proved worthless as it would not stay connected.  It is a cheap barrel connector that does not seat very will in the charging port on the laptop.  It was so sensitive to even find a position that it could actually charge that once I got it in the just the right spot I had to hold my breath and hope it would not get jiggled.  Sneeze and it would come loose and stop providing power.  I finally after reading some reviews realized it would power and charge of the mini-USB port which it did but could barely provide enough power to charge it and if the tablet was being used it would consume more power than the USB could provide until the battery was drained.  4 Months into ownership and frustration it will now no longer power up?  I suspect that it is just no longer charging or something with the batter but who knows.  Sent a message to the Fusion5 folks to see what they say but can't really give this more than a star since I was never really able to use it reliably.
4,The tablet has a slow touch screen but no problems other than that.
4,The tablet works well for me as a supplement to a Windows 10 Desktop. It's portable and good for document editing and streaming. Touch sensitivity and lag can become an occasional issue if you have multiple things running at once but it's less than I would expect at this price point. I have the higher RAM option for reference.
5,I am a desktop kind of guy and prefer a easy to read screen but I needed something for the road. I looked at a lot of tablets before ordering the Fusion5 and weighing all of the attributes size screen battery camera the Fusion was my choice. And I am quite pleased it is the one I went with. So far it has been great. Easy access to WiFi when I am traveling fits in my messenger bag nicely and the screen is just right. This has turned out to be a good investment.
4,Tablet meets all exceptions. The full-sized USB port is the best feature.What is hard to find is the proper attachable keyboard. Keyboards are described as "does NOT fit [size]' rather that what is a proper attachable keyboard by defined model. Product description should list correct keyboard model and keyboard should list what model is designed for use.
4,Light duty Windows machine when you do not need a lot of memory or power programs running.
4,I liked the tablet very much but had to send it back because of the bad speakers they sound like an old very cheap transistor radio my Samsung tablet is probably 10 times louder and more clear. It would be a 5 star tablet if they would fix the speakers and I would certainly purchase again.PLEASE fix the speakers!
4,The Fusion5 is delivering as promoted. Good size for a tablet and quick recharge time. Videos are very clear quality.
4,It works fine out of the box my windows did an update and now some drivers don't work. I went to the website to try and find updated drivers but it seems they don't have any. Overall the tablet does work and is fast but as stated I need the updated driver to fix issues with the camera and auto rotation of the screen.
5,I've just got this tablet set up so I can't say too much about it yet. The touch screen seems nicely responsive and is nice and clear. I bought this tablet for my wife's new longarm quilting machine but we're not expecting it for a few weeks yet.
4,Performance is excellent once up and running.  the Quick Start instructions need to be more explicit and tailored to a more basic audience. I had difficulty working thru the set up but once up and running it is easy to navigate.  Very good value for the money!
3,I like this tablet computer with the exception on two things the speaker quality isn't very good at all . The only way you can hear it well is with headphones. When using the keyboard on screen the buttons under the keyboard get pushed while typing that is areal pain. But the system is good running as well as good looking.has lots of nice features as well.
5,It's a great addition for the purposes of having access to a pc  on a tablet with usb accessibility I needed windows and not an android os for portability compared to a laptop in terms of boot time and of course price it's compact lightweight and easy to use
4,I like the compact size; easy to carry.  I like that it has a USB port. I use it for travel.
5,I purchased this tablet to replace a Quantum of similar type and it has been great faster brighter and a better touch screen than my previous Windows tablet. I shopped around and this was the best fit for my needs and well worth what I paid (less than the previous tablet). Called customer service when it was taking along time to start but it was only updating Windows I was assisted quickly and courteously and resolved in a couple of minutes.
4,I purchased this tablet because it is sleek and easy to use so I did not have to use my computer to watch TV or movies. The sound quality is not the greatest but for one person works well.  I would recommend a speaker if you are to use it in a loud space but great size and fits in a cute case and inexpensive for a tablet.
4,Love my new tablet! I use it just like a laptop. My only con is the battery life doesn't seem like it stays charged long. Other than that it is great buy it!
5,I purchased this tablet as a supplement and replacement for a notebook and work desk. The tablet works well and has no issues with running windows 10. When combined with the use of google drive it is a great and lightweight option for doing homework or writing reports. This also works as a great replacement for textbooks and a notebook. It will seriously lighten the total load that you will have to carry to class and give you all the basic things you need to complete any work or study that you may need to use.
4,Bought this product so my dad could browse the internet and it does the job well. Fortunately that's all he uses it for and plans to use it for. If you don't plan to get too crazy with it I'd say it was worth the price especially since it was on sale. No problems so far and feels fairly responsive.
4,Great tablet!  We ordered for our teenage daughter.  Good screen quality and great battery life.  Nice tablet for the price!
1,Missing MSVCP140.dll file so can't run a program I purchased to run even though others are running the exact same tablet and the program I want to run. So honestly it's worthless to me as it was purchased only for this use . Update changed from 3 star to 1 star. Tablet and tech support by both the seller and Amazon are both kindergarten level tech support with no resolve. I was told to give the seller until Sunday to fix this. They have told me to reset the tablet  I did so and still missing vital files that keep me from.runnimg a standard program others can run on the same device. Well now it's Sunday and they want me to jump through more hoops to get my money back. Pay for prime service and they want me home to give to ups or drive 30 min to ups. Why pay for prime should have went to bestbuy and bought it.
1,This worked for the first 2 months. Now it’s a struggle to turn on if I can get it on!  I sent it to the support team and all they did was re- image it. I still can’t turn it on. I have others try and they get the same results.  I wish I never bought it.
4,Product came on time and it seems to be working well so far liked the price point as well.
4,The touch screen is not as sensitive as I'd like it to be.  It usually takes a few taps.I use it for school work but mostly to hold my piano music.
5,THIS IS MY FIRST TABLET. I NEEDED SOMETHING FOR ZOOM MEETINGS WHILE WORKING FROM HOME.  I ALSO NEEDED A USB PORT FOR FILES ON MY FLASH DRIVE I NEEDED TO GET MY EMAIL AND HULU AND NETFLIX. AND THIS DOES IT ALL!  VERY HAPPY SO FAR!STACEY MCHENRYHOUSTON TXSomeone wanted to see dimensions so I took these. Like 10.1 x right under 7 inches
3,The screen quality is great its perfect for what i purchased it for my mom to use. But she is having trouble with it it turns on but even with a full battery charge it turns off and it'll only turn back on if its connected to the charger. Once it comea back on we disconnect it amd it works fine. And about 20 min later if its untouched it'll turn off again. Not sure if its defected or not but i do have a warranty on it and am looking on getting it fixed/replaced. Other than that its a great product when it works.
5,Like the size and light weight  sound quality is kinda poor and trying to find a decent case is a challenge.
4,It’s a nice tablet. Wow is great with my quickbooks Pos. Just wish it came with the keyboard. Will be buying a few more.
5,Love the size of the screen and the quality of the screen durable battery life and it's perfect for me while I'm on the go to connect to any available internet anywhere for work and school.
4,I really like the screen quality but touch screen is a little slow. The only problem is I can't download free Facebook and YouTube App.
5,I'm A very senior man with degrees in engineering who used a slide rule in college that was all we had to calculate with. So not to text savvy!  It fits my needs very well. Is on my desk not in my way. Has a clear easy to read screen! I would order it again!!
4,I like having a tablet and laptop in one .it a long time in coming
4,This windows 10 1" fusion5 is pretty easy to use and exactly what I needed.  I was originally gonna buy a all-in-one desktop but I needed something portable for school and to use in meetings. I would give a perfect 5 but there is a glare on screen when excessive light is on it and the screen/ camera resolution could be a little better.
5,I am REALLY REALLY IMPRESSED with this tablet.  I cannot believe how fast and responsive it is.  I expected it to be sluggish and a little slow being just "a tablet" but it opens programs extremely quickly and the screen colors are better than my desktop PC.  It has a generous amount of memory but having the option of adding a micro SD card is a huge bonus.  I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product to anyone who needs to keep their electronic life with them on the go.
4,very pricey tablet and the speaker very weak!!!!! also the battery life it's very poor
4,Speakers are to quiet for me but the picture quality is nice I use if for playing older games and Netflix.
4,Its a small laptop. It has everything you need. Touch sensor seems to delay for one it could be if you have bigger fingers hard to select and touch- its small screen but not dad. I still recommend it.
5,I'M A HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL COACH. I HAVE A COUPLE OF PROGRAMS DOWNLOADEDTO GO OVER PLAYS. THE DOWLOADING WENT VERY SMOOTH AND QUICKLY. WHICH I WASSUPRISED. I'M A WINDOWS PERSON. USING MY NEW TABLET WAS ACTUALLY FUN. JUSTLIKE USING MY DESKTOP. VERY CLEAR PICTURES. SCREEN IS LARGE AND CLEARENOUGH SO ALL THE PLAYERS CAN SEE. WINDOW'S 10 FUSION 5 TABLET IS FAR MOREEFFICIENT THAN SAMSUNGKINDLE OR ANY BRAND NAME TABLETS. I WOULD RECOMMENDTHIS TABLET AND ESPECIALLY FOR THE PRICE.
5,This tablet was really helpful in being able to print word documents.
4,Great battery life and fast speed.
4,So far I like having a PC that I can take with my a it is great fir me. I'm studying for my Payroll Specialist Exam and i keep my notes in Google Docs and now I have it on me at all times. I haven't had it for a long time so I will update this review in about 2weeks from now.
1,The Tablet worked ok for the first couple weeks but started shutting off on its own intermittently.  After one month the tablet is completely dead and unresponsive.  I reached out to the company to resolve the issue and they set a replacement charger.  After receiving the new charger I found that the replacement was the wrong type for this tablet.  They will not send a replacement tablet now because I'm outside of the returns period.  Very disappointed in this product and the customer service.  I wouldn't suggest this tablet to anyone.
5,I bought this to run hp tuners and keep it in the car.  Cant beat it.  Would love a solid case for this.
1,At first I thought this tablet worked fine. But the more I use it the more I hate it.It's incredibly slow even when doing things that don't use wi-fi (and has been dince I first booted it). Sometimes it won't start up at all unless it's plugged into its charger just right even if the battery is full.  It's been bugging me for weeks to update but when I tell it yo ho ahead and do so it freezes and shuts down. Then it wants to update again the next time I turn it on.I only bought this tablet so I could read large graphics-heavy PDF files like annual reports easily instead of zooming in and out of them on my phone. But it's so annoying to use I often end up using my phone anyway!I had an ASUS tablet before this that lasted 7 years and was my main machine through grad school. I wish I had spent the extra money to buy the newer version of that tablet instead of this one. Definitely got what I did (not) pay for here.
5,I wanted a tablet for streaming and movies and one for work.  With this one I didn't have to choose. Battery life is good and screen is solid.  Bought a case and now this is my new go-to machine for work and leisure.
4,This tablet fit all my needs I had for it in terms of design software I used it for in rough projects before I moved them to my PC. However the audio from the Tablet is horrible the speaker isn't good and the headphone jack isn't much of an improvement when using headphones.
5,I love this tablet.  The price and functionality is perfect!  I'm using mine for photo booth operations but the Windows 10 was a must.  The product arrived on time looks feels and functions excellent and saved me lots of money.  I can't complain about anything.  I highly recommend this product for anyone needing or wanting an Windows 10 device at a fantastic price.  I will definitely purchase more Fusion products and accessories in the future.
4,I really haven't had a chance to use this tablet much.  I got it to take on an upcoming trip so I didn't need to take my laptop.  The setup seemed pretty straight forward and installing Microsoft office was not an issue.  I will update this review when I return from my trip.
5,This tablet preforms admirably with good and simple connections and controls. I have two of them the other with 128 storage. I will be using them with kindle to read my music instead of all that paper. They also have a cryatl clear display. They are great.
3,Purchased insurance with tablet.  Broke screen.  Sent for repair.  Was told it was not repairable.  Did not receive placement.  Did not receive refund.
5,Yes  I really love my Windows 10 tablet. It is really fast and dependable.
4,good but battery life is short.
5,I'm using this as an inexpensive device for field work - protect it with a few accessories (screen protector and silicone case)  carry along a external battery pack for on-the-fly recharging and I'm good to go for hours. Blue-tooth connection for a GPS device and mouse along with plugging in other USB accessories and a memory chip - this is well set up.Prior tablet had only 2GB RAM - the 4GB capacity on this makes a real difference on a couple of my key apps.
4,So far the tablet is great and I don't really have any complaints. Works just as my PC would! There are two charging cords so I'm not sure if one charges fast than the other but so far that's the only thing I'm not fond of is the time it seems to take to get to 100 percent.
4,Good Windows 10 Tablet for the price
5,Polished appearance and quality touch and feel.  Comfortable size to weight.Safe tactile feel when holding tablet.Of course the screen has nice quality and sharpness. The color of skin tones are better than I expected of such a reasonably priced tablet.  I am not a technical person rather an accountant but I am impressed with the fact I could load a legacy spreadsheet application such as Lotus 1-2-3. My only complaint is that the charging plug/pin into the tablet is small and not easy to insert - a picky point!
5,Seller shipped exactly as advertised.One unit would not charge when connected to any of the supplied chargers.Swapped cables but no luck.This ONE UNIT charged normally with a charger used from my Surface tab that I purchased new years ago.I tested charging specs and it must be not less than 5V at 2.39 A so that battery will begin to charge.A 2.1A charger WILL NOT WORK
4,The only complaint I have is the inability to add another browser. It's browser would not allow me to turn pages in an online book that I could turn on my computer and on my phone.
4,Unlike other Windows tablets this little guy is running a full version of Windows 10. You can run most all of your desktop programs just like on you home PC.  I'm a software developer and have been waiting for this feature in a tablet for a very long time. Thank you Fusion5. Well done. :)
4,The tablet have nice features and feel to it. I like the tablet and would have given it a 5 stars if the audio volume was a bit better.
4,This is a great tablet for the money.  I have ordered several of these.  A couple of them have come with minor defects in the display.  They were very minor however.
5,I got this tablet specifically to use the app Chordle for my band. We wanted to upgrade from paper sheet music in a binder to having it all conveniently on a tablet. It works great with it and has great battery life so it's perfect for this need. I was also impressed how well it plays videos/games etc. I didn't expect to use it for much more than that app but I definitely do quite often now. Overall very happy with this purchase!
5,Before this tablet I had an android product which I hate. The Windows 10 platform is far superior and this tablet is so much more enjoyable to use. It is affordable. I haven't really explored its potential yet but I am looking forward to seeing just what it can do. The battery seems to deplete rather quickly but I don't have a lot to compare it to. For me that is not a problem. I love my new tablet as much as I hated my old one.
5,The quality and performance is exceptional.  Full size USB micro USB and mini HDMI ports and dedicated power connection!  (Also and microSD slot.)  Comes in S-Mode but easy to change to regular "Windows Home" or upgrade (pay for) to Windows Pro.  Love it!
5,I use this mostly to watch videos while I cook or do dishes. Netflix and Hulu work great on it although a little slow. The reason I got this instead of a android tablet or ipad is because I also use it to do some light computer work when I'm traveling that I can't do on a android or ipad. The price also didn't hurt
4,I love this computer it's really nice for the price point however I would have liked a little more ram on it. Overall it's pretty nice.
5,It's a great tablet! I loved the screen size and that Windows runs smoothly on it and of course its battery life is stunning.The only thing I found to be a little bit of an inconvenient is the fact that it charges only through an AC power cord making not possible to use USB cable to charge it.Besides that since I use it to write and edit reports for College I find it a great deal and very important affordable.
4,Good battery life works like a small computer.
5,I bought this tablet for my mom's birthday so that she would have a tablet with a system she was familiar with and something that would be portable.  She likes it and uses it often.  The only downside is that not all of her games can be downloaded as apps so she utilizes them within the web browser.
5,Great tablet. Bought not knowing much about the brand. Easy set up runs fast. Screen seems to respond better than other tablets I have used. Batter life is great even with heavy usage.
3,I like everything about my little tablet.  It was so easy to setup and no problem to operate.  Only problem I had was finding a cover I liked that fit.  Well I have had a little over a month the charging plug on the tablet itself has broke.  It does have a DC charging port that I am going to try to use and see how that does.
5,I have purchased 3 Fusion5 Windows Tablets and have been extremely happy with all of them. The first one was dropped onto the floor and even though the screen was cracked along one corner the tablet continued to function well. I simply had to rotate the screen if I needed to click on something in the cracked corner. It's pretty fast to load pages and came with everything I needed pre-installed. Very happy with this product especially considering the low price.
5,I bought this tablet for our asphalt business so that we could have access to our information when out in the field. So far we are loving this mini computer and it has saved us a ton of time and headaches because we have our information at all times. We would definitely recommend it to all small business owners and anyone who wants access to their account when away from their computer.
5,So Far this Tablet is being working Great!!!Convenient that it have different ports that you can hook mouse or keyboard etc.It's like working from your computer.Great product!
5,Purchased this to use with my cookie business.  Not as fast as I'd like but performs well. Customer service has been quick to respond to my questions.
5,I wanted a tablet device that had a USB connect possibility.  Fusion 5 offers that and other reviews were very strong in performance.  The price is very good.  I'm still working on my performance with using the table but overall I think it is an excellent product. Jude
2,We were using this product in a restaurant to take orders at the table or outside in the drive thru. Operationally it was just too slow.
5,It was easy to set up. There were several parts I thought would be difficult I was amazed at how simple it actually was. I do wish it had a physical keyboard and that battery life was longer but I am very happy with it.
4,difficulty setting setting programs.  But that was due to Microsoft.
1,got win 11 twice. it's not a "Free upgrade" it's false advertising. do not buy.they don't care that you want win 11. they are pushing out the slower win 11 at your expense.decided to try anyway touch pad didn't respond at the bottom right.  and screen is grainy.doesn't let you use google play.any cheap laptop would be better.
5,I was hesitant to believe that a 10" tablet could offer me the power responsiveness and flexibility I needed to use for work and school. This Windows tablet gives me everything I need in a sleek compact and ready to travel tablet. I cannot recommend it enough.
5,I have been using the Fusion for several weeks now and must say that I am completely happy with my purchase.  This tablet has been both fast and very responsive.  The battery life has been better than what I had expected.  The battery lasts as long if not better than some of my android and fire tablet.  I give this item a definite thumbs up.  I would have no hesitation buying this item again.
4,This product is great for what I need a windows machine with a battery that I can use to perform vehicle diagnosis and take electronic repair info into the shop with me. The screen has already started to delaminate in the corner like another user had posted but otherwise an ok value.
5,Extremely happy with the Fusion 5 Windows Tablet!  It does everything my home PC does and it's PORTABLE! With such a busy schedule I'm able to take my tablet with me and follow up with what's going on at home.  I am extremely happy and satisfied with my purchase!
3,Hard to boot up. Refused to accept gmail passwords on 3 accounts. Frustrating.
5,Great little windows tablet. Perfect for use with my long arm sewing and quilting machine and automation software quilters creative touch 5. No complaints. This will be all I use it for.
1,I have been kind of surprised at the sluggishness on the internet. Sometimes doing things I would have thought would not take much computing power or memory are slow and I know it's not the wireless because if I switch to my big computer at the same desk on the same wireless it is much faster. For example the other day I got to gmail okay and opened up a message ok but then when I tried to reply it just didn't seem to want to do it. I also had it fail on some uploads to Google Drive but the files went fine from the big computer.Overall I have found it useful but I would not want it to be my only computer.Update: I purchased this a little over a year ago and my return and support windows have closed. It stopped working this week. Not sure if it is that it stopped charging or something else. But even before that I found the tablet good only as a glorified Kindle. I never could download a software executable. For example when I tried to download Zoom the little circle just kept going. Whereas my 2008 vintage desktop had no trouble - same wireless network same distance from the router.
4,Purchased Fusion5 for testing purposes. Fusion5 is a good size tablet however doesn’t seem to be very compatible with the software we are using to run testers. This tablet is good for at home use.
5,This will be use for personal/home use. As a senior citizen it would help to have an old fashioned user's guide or manual.I'm requesting the 32 GB high-speed Micro sd card as my free gift. There didn't seem to be a place to note this request.
5,I use it for an on-line course among other things like email and zoom meetings. I find myself using it more and more each day because it is so functional. It works seamlessly and has excel and word already installed! It works very well to read books as it is lightweight and it functions like a small laptop.
4,I use the product foe entertainment and keeping our finances. The only thing keeping it from getting 5 stars is the power cord connection. I find that too small and it will be easy to damage. Otherwise the tablet is all you could want in its price range.
5,Es perfecto en todo No tiene ningún problema por el momento me funciona perfecto
4,It's a good tablet for the price just don't expect the same performance as a high end laptop.  If you surfing the web accessing email reading etc. it works really well.  The 10 inch display is a good compromise on size.
2,For a product costing $219+ you would think that a company producing a product like this would have a longer obsolescencerate! No one to contact about problems. An OH WELL attitude! Also wanted to add when checking battery in tablet IT WAS ELEVEN YEARS OLD!!! NO WONDER IT DIED!!seems to be way of the DAY! It's to bad that Amazon backs this.I tried to get the DEAD TABLET working in every conceivable way possible in my pay grade. However nothing happened.
1,It is slow. Annoyingly so
4,Works well and very responsive. Screen is a bit dim but battery seems fairly good. No problems and running Windows is a huge boon. Also has all the ports you need. Would recommend.
5,Fast operating system lots of RAM and storage good graphics etc.  The only negative is the sound volume but supports both headphones and Bluetooth audio devices.  Wi-Fi internet connection works fine for email news etc.  Very satisfied.
4,I use this for homework and games. Works well just got it so still in the opening stages of use. Tablet gets a little warm.
2,This is a very nice tablet. The only reason I'm returning it is because it doesn't support and have access to Google play so if you're looking to connect anything to your tablet (to have that option of having a bigger screen) chances are you won't be able to because the tablet doesn't have the ability to connect to the Google playstore and download. If you're just looking for a tablet to use without downloading any apps then this is it for you. Works great touch screen was awesome the keyboard had a little trouble connecting at first but eventually the devices recognized each other and I was able to use it. Overall it's a decent tablet.
5,I got this for a present for my husband to use in his ministry and it meets his needs.  he is very happy with it.
4,This is a very nice tablet. I love everything about it except the sound quality could be a little better.
5,Couldn't wait to get the tablet. I had an Apple Ipad and it was terrible. Glad to get back to windows. The pad is just like Apple. So far it works as expected . Easy set up nice screen  and fast.
5,I purchased the 10.1" FWIN232 PLUS Windows 10 PC. This portable touch screen device is perfect for my kiosk application. I would recommend it for anyone looking for a low cost reliable and stable Windows tablet.
3,I bought this to run an archive-study software since my PC stopped working and my Chromebook cannot run Verbum.Organizing the programs are easy and it has the great feature of being able to switch between "tablet mode" (great for portable/quick use) and computer mode (good for typing/multiple tabs/ doing pc things) where it behaves like a laptop.It is slower than I expected though.  Even brand new and with only default stuff on it. Cannot seem to get a chrome app/browser either - so you're stuck with Edge.
4,Use for business.
5,Great quality product very nice screen quality I’m using it to run my cnc projects touch screen makes it so much easierVery happy with the purchase
4,We got this for our seven year old son and he loves it.
4,This is a great tablet for generic usage (games browsing the internet movies etc) but the battery life is awful.
5,Excellent so far. I bought it for school and it's exactly what I needed. Small portable and allows me to write my papers on it.
4,The touch screen is a bit delayed. Totally the quality I paid for. It is a good tablet and gets the job done.
5,This has proved to be a great investment for a tablet. The performance is very good for basic usage (most used apps for me are Microsoft Ultimate Word Games NextGen news reader Microsoft OneNote). I really appreciate the "real" USB and HDMI connections. The only downside is that cases are limited. The one I purchase with it is heavy but works well. I typically use the on-screen keyboard but have played with a BT connected one.
5,This tablet pc is awesome. The screen quality the window 10 software makes it fast and efficient. There are no issues at all with the touch screen. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a convenient tablet pc to purchase.
4,Likes: QualityPriceFeaturesSpeed could be betterI mainly use it for Streaming Videos Kindle PC app Travel.
4,I just love my new fusion 5 tablet PC
5,I use mine for Cnc software..there is some lag from the initial click to the window opening..like 2 mins..other than that pretty cool
5,I am very happy with this tablet it has worked wonderfully for what I need it without a doubt I recommend it
3,I got the tablet for my husband for his birthday he said he liked the tablet except for a couple things. The corners of the screen pop up a little after awhile and need to be pushed back down as you can seen in the picture. Also he didn't notice this until later but the front camera has a blue haze. i cleaned it and it is always still there.
5,EXCELENTE PRODUCTO TUVE UN ACCIDENTE CON UNA DE LAS TRES QUE COMPRE POR ERROR PROPIO Y SU SERVICIO TECNICO ES RAPIDO Y EFICIENTE.
5,This is a great Windows based tablet. I purchased it to help me with my job and cataloging Powersports equipment that was in our shop. I found that it has a lot more to offer than expected. A great price and great investment.
5,I got this to aid in navigation and ham radio interfacing while off roading.  The battery life is decent and it has worked so far with every usb cable/accessory I have tried as well as a dozen applications.  It really is a mini laptop without an attached keyboard.  The 4GB ram is helpful and a bonus as most tablets in this price range only offer 2gb.  I am really happy with this purchase!
1,I tried to get a protection plan on it and right before it arrived I was notified the protection plan was cancelled which I suppose I should have seen as foreshadowing.Today it arrived and it doesn’t have a legal copy of windows out of the box After putting it in a case in my bag and looking at it again there’s an inexplicable grease bubble under the screen now.Speaking of screens mine was put on so poorly I thought it was the screen protector because it curls up a bit in the corners (not pictured above).My previous AWOW tablet got a cracked screen and I got this as a reimbursement needless to say it would have been better to keep the cracked tablet than deal with this.I am immensely disappointed.
4,Screen is a little small but a nice way to have a pc as a tablet. I recommend buying the keyboard too but it works ok without it. If you travel and need a pc you can carry this is a good option.
5,Very responsive easy to use and lightweight tablet.  Perfect fit for my purpose.  I'm using this to control a small CNC machine which requires a Windows computer (ideally without a fan).  A+ would buy again.
4,Presents as a capable tablet - especially for the money -
5,I love this tablet it came super fast and its perfect for my son to use to listen to music and play his videos. It also helps him learn how to use an actual PC which is a thumbs up for me.
4,it works well for me. i'm very pleased with my purchase.
5,Works as advertised easy to use no problems
5,Compared to what I had before this is much better faster and easier to use
3,Overall very pleased.  Exceeded expectations in every area except one.  The speakers are terrible!  Can't even hear most notifications.  I went through every setting possible all are 100%.  Even right up to either left or right speaker I can barely discern any sound output at all.My father in law bought 2 fusion5 laptops for my girls for Christmas.  Same deal! almost no sound!Dear Fusion5.  Earbud speakers don't make good PC speakers!
4,Very light weight and functional. It does what it's supposed to do; compared to other products definitely a great buy. I had an issue with an order I initially placed but the item was promptly replaced. I am very happy with it.
4,Very nice unit. Well constructed. Full complement of external connectors. Excellent battery life.
5,Excellent product worked perfect for what I needed the tablet to do. That was be able to communicate with my car.
5,I like the quick delivery and the packaging was secure. I have only just turned it on but it is just what I expected from Fusion 5 stores. I especially like the price.
4,Exactly what I needed for a reasonable price.  Allows me to download edit and share u/w photos with ease.  Enjoying the mobility of a window tablet while I travel.
1,Tablet looks and feels great but it is incredibly slow. I got as far as installing a few apps and trying browse the Internet and that was when I knew this tablet wasn't for me. I tried using the tablet 4 ir 5 times and just became frustrated with how slow it was. Then to top things off it took 3 HOURS to complete a factory reset just so I can return it. I've NEVER owned a piece of technology that processed so slow. Getting a Samsung S7 and hoping for much better results.
4,I like the size and the ease of using it. It fits perfectly with what I had in mind and for what I use it for!
4,I bought the Fusion 5 for emergency digital mobile Amateur Radio operations. It worked well as message and radio control computer.  Hal/WA7FIV
5,I was worried that it would be slow but i was wrong. It works great and very easy to set up. veryclear picture when watching videos
5,Love the fusion5 this tablet exceed my expectations. I was looking a tablet just to watch videos and I got more for a affordable price.
5,This is a fully functional windows machine. I truly only bought it as device to stream movies through a projector with. This does that and everything else you need.
5,I like this tablet more then other tablets that only have apps on them. This is like having another computer.
5,I bought this and the keyboard to be able to from zoom presentations and to work away from my desktop. Would highly recommend.
5,I like that it is light weight and it responds fast  when clicking on something and it is great for watching movies and playing games
5,I primarily use this Tablet for watching videos browsing the web and remotely accessing my workstation PC for programming and machine learning. If you are not actively using the Tablet I would recommend that you shut it down as I have noticed that it dies notably faster in sleep mode.
2,The Text is horrible very faint and broken like a pen running out of ink. The headphone jack was messed up right out of the box . I have to pull it out part way to . work no matter what headset I use.  It's very inconsistent  sometimes quick and other times it takes forever to load simple tasks.The screen is cheap  it scratches fast . Don't use it without a protective cover. I put it in a case and  The corners started to separate like a film coming apart. I seldom do a  review  but this purchase really has me chapped...Very disappointed.Update Feb 20 ... this fine piece of engineering  has died. It no longer turns on yet the warmth of the battery tells me it's at least charging.  A $200  brick only 4 months old .
4,I really like this tablet right now. I got it for my mom for Christmas this year so we will see
5,Overall a pretty good tablet for the price my only gripe is that the touchscreen is a little too picky on what I'm pressing even with a stylus but still a great tablet.
2,This fusion5 tablet is very thin fast to set up and runs fast right out of the box.  I configured it in less than 10 minutes connected to my Windows account OneDrive and everthing was synced up.  The 4gb ram and Quad Core Intel processor makes this a fast little tablet.  Perfect for the living room.Revised review.  The screen developed an oblong defect approxiamately 3 inches wide from normal use after 3 months.  Not real happy.
5,Great screen quality. Touch screen is pretty good. Battery life has been good so far. Overall a great tablet for the price
5,This is a very nice windows tablet that I have been using for over a month now. Screen is nice and clear sharp resolution and is not bulky feeling. Works great for doing school work which is why I purchased this over an android tablet. It connects to wifi very easy. I also like that it has a memory card slot to expand the size. I highly recommend this product.
4,Nice tablet
5,A very nice win 10 tablet very good screen quality touchscreen is responsive and battery life could be a little better but it charges fast. N standard wifi is kind of slow but it works very well. Setup was easy and everything works very well.
4,good tablet for the price. great for light tasks like browsing internet and watching videos.  4 gb of ram allows for more multitasking.  lags on more demanding applications but not my reason for buying this tablet.
5,The tablet was one of the easiest machines to set up. Just follow the prompts and you're good to go.
5,We purchased this for our son this past Christmas and he hasn't went a day without use! Very good sizedurable clear picture wonderful for use anywhere! We have had it with us everywhere lol. Keeps a good charge and love the programs. Very good for school home or wherever! Worth every penny ♡♡
5,I found this tablet very easy to use the screen display is very vivid. I highly recommend it.
4,great for a garage some window issues but overall a good product
5,I am 100% apple user however i had to buy a windows as apple was not compatible for a certain app. I am just now learning this great little devise which is super lightweight and so far  a breeze - Stay tuned after I get to know this little beauty more.
5,This was purchased for business use basically to run a single web-based application.  It booted quickly unlike some Android tablets and performed well.  It has all the functionality we need to connect it to various peripherals including a Bluetooth barcode scanner and a USB check/creditcard reader.  It won't go into full production mode until the middle of March 2019 and if it fails in anyway I'll update; otherwise 5 stars!
5,I found the reviews quite accurate - it is a great purchase for the price and performance was not over-rated. The keyboard/case is a must if you will be using word excel or PowerPoint among other programs. After using it for nearly two weeks it has become a go-to option for most all computer & internet tasks.
5,So far so good  the screen is crystal clear touch screen right on battery does  perty good but I run a lot of programs at once so its expected to run out fast.
4,The touch Screen is not very sensitive. Okay Overall.
4,Very good tablet for small tasks and browsing the web! Not to much processing power but does the job! Nice size and nice quality build! For the price it's a good tablet to have!
5,Very nice product thus far. Haven't had it  long but it was very easy to get setup and seems to run Windows 10 great. Have loaded some older Windows programs on it and they work very well. Seems to be as sturdy and well-built as any "big-name-brand" tablet I've owned. Plan to buy more for our business and customers.
4,The Fusion5 is lightweight easy to carry around and has the basic functionality of a PC in a tablet.  I will be ordering the keyboard cover but very happy with the product so far.
5,This tablet works great
5,Replaced my old tablet that quit with a Fusion 5 windows 10 tablet.Works well checking email watching movies and reading PDF manuals.Battery life seems to be good for me.The touch screen sometimes takes a couple taps to work or it my be me.Have not loaded any software to se how well that works.For the price I highly recommend it .
5,This tablet is an incredible value! I bought this specifically so I could work while not taking my laptop everywhere. Being able to run windows AND having a fullsize USB port is unbelievably convenient. The speed and response of the touchscreen is excellent for day to day business application and can be used for basic mobile gaming. If youre looking for a small lightweight business solution youve found it!
5,Works great if I was to say anything bad about it I would say it isn't very loud. All being said for what I bought it for works awesome!
4,Good replacement for the Dell tablet I Had previously.
4,Excellent product fast and nice
5,I purchased this Windows tablet to run my MiniDSP software to help time my car stereo system. I am going to mount it on a seat bolt arm. So far it has been great. Fast start up quick opening programs. The only drawback has been the touch sensitivity on my DSP software but that is probably a software issue not being optimized for touch screens.
5,This very slim and functional unit worked great right out of the box. Very easy setup. Was getting email and apps within a couple of minutes.Con: I would have liked to have a docking keyboard available and the unit comes with a wall plug in type charger instead of the usual USB. This can be an issue when traveling.Other than the two issues mentioned this is well worth the money.
5,This was a Christmas present for my husband.  He likes the speed and wuality of the tablet.  He especially likes having the USB port.
4,A solid product at a great price. Compact and perfect for use as my tabletop gaming computer. Also perfect compact device for packing around and writing or sketching.
4,Pros: full sized USB port large screen lightweight HDMI portCons: low quality speakers power port is too close to USB port
4,The best windows tablet in this process range. All of the available ports are great to have as well.
5,I use my tablet for a quilting machine and it works perfectly with my machine.
5,Nice size tablet to accompany bluetooth keyboard. Easy set up and use. Thank you!
2,I got this product to give it a chance. It is made by a smaller manufacturer and I try to give those a chance. Unfortunately the tablet was a nightmare. It took 4 hours to charge from 9% to 30%. Typing was difficult due to the lapse in it trying to catch up to the speed of my typing. I typed slow. It wouldn’t connect to ANY of my Bluetooth devices which my phone and laptop have no problem connecting to. Then after deciding to return it and trying to wipe the drive of ALL of my personal info to factory reset the screen decided then to completely stop working. It was a major disappointment..
5,This is a great little Windows 10 tablet. It worked perfect right out of the box. I watched my favorite YouTube video's and it works great. I am using it now to write this review also with the keyboard I bought for it which also works great. I recommend this tablet to everyone. You wont find a better deal anywhere. I can't wait to see what comes next.
5,It seems like a capable little tablet.  Browser response is fast.  Install times are slightly slower but you'd expect that for a tablet with a lightweight CPU.  The most pleasant surprise is that there is no bloatware on this unit.  The only downside is that it is only Windows 10 Home which will not allow me to run Remote Desktop but the would increase the price.
3,The size and functions of the tablet are great. The speed of different apps could be faster.
5,This is the best tablet I have found. The battery life is long. Now I have to find a pin that I can use on it
5,Great tablet for the price. The screen quality is suburb battery life is longer then expected. Also the touch screen is very easy to maneuver.
5,This unit is a great value for the price it has exceeded my expectations.
4,It's small and lightweight which makes it portable and convenient for me to carry around with me.  It's good for what I need it for (web surfing email videos).
5,Great product.  Purchased to run web based info on TV monitors.  Fast speed and clear picture.Thanks!
5,Easy to set up.  I use 8.1 operating system for my regular computer so Windows 10 will take a little time to get use too.  Battery last a lot longer than anything I have had before.  My only concern is when the tablet goes to sleep the internet shuts off and when I wake the tablet up there is no internet.  Could be my internet
5,I liked everything it's perfect for what I needed it for  no complaints and definitely 2 thumbs up
5,For a tablet with these specifications it'd be difficult to find a better product for $200. Got it as a birthday gift for my 10 year old niece and she loves it.
5,Excellent product value. Delivery was earlier than expected. Touch screen may be less sensitive than other brands. I experienced some issues customizingWin10 but they were resolved using Microsoft support. If you use the defult settings you should not have any problems.
4,I liked the speed of the tablet. But sometimes screen doesn't respond to touch. I’m gonna use this tablet for work
5,The screen quality is great and as for the battery and touch screen i would recommend this product to a friend
5,Battery life is great.. Works flawlessly with my shapeoko
5,I needed a win10 tablet and i went with all the positive reviews to find out it's a pretty smooth tablet. It connects my hardware 3 power units on my motorcycle to the manufacture through WiFi effortlessly. I bought a USB 3.0 to Ethernet/(3)USB 3.0 for faster downloading at home with optional goodie expansion and it runs even faster. Luv it!
1,I tried two tablets. Worked great when received but after adding Microsoft account and then setting up apps and email the touch screen only worked part time. Use a mouse it worked great but switching between tablet mode and Windows mode couldn't be done. Factory resetting touch screen worked again until I added account. Not worth the money or the hassel. Look for something else. Couldn't add a Google play account to it because Microsoft had it locked out. So play apps weren't accessible. Sent it back for refund.
4,Just wat a need and good size
4,good easy to used
5,I purchased the Fusion5 10.1" tablet for use with  Quilters Creative Touch robotics program.  The tablet mounts on a bracket that is attached to the quilting machine and runs the design program.  The Fusion5 had all of the features necessary to optimize the use of the QCT software with quite a few extras that I haven't explored yet.  I can't be more pleased with the purchase!
5,Great screen quality  long battery life  easy to set up.
5,This windows based tablet is the perfect replacement for a bulky laptop. It does everything I need it to do while being more versatile than an android based tablet. Love it!!!
5,I love this product. Great clear screen quality small easy to handle light convenient itso cute! Prefect!
3,Great for the money but has major flaws: 1. Will not let me use Chrome as my browser. 2. Will not let me use Google Play to order apps Microsoft Store is limited. 3. Can't find case that has openings for camera. Return policy seems restrictive. I will re-gift to someone.
5,This tablet is faster than my iPad. I find myself grabbing it more often than the Apple now and I'm typically an Apple user. The resolution is very sharp and it is a joy to use. Would recomend this to my friends. Thanks!
5,Easy to set up and use. I am using it for a reservation system and it was easy to set up.
5,Perfect size for a kiosk battery life is great too. We also use it as a casting device for a meeting room perfect size as well.
5,I love it! It’s lightweight fast and easy to use. It does everything I need it to and I feel it was a good value.
5,I use this primarily for music performances and it's the second one I've purchased.  The first was a 32 gig hard drive.  This one is brighter in the screen.  My only problem is that when  click on a song it takes an extra second to engage.  Otherwise I love this tablet.
5,This is my first  tablet item of any kind and I'm extremely happy with my purchase. The picture quality is crystal clear the maneuvering of the apps etc is so easy. And the price unbeatable. Thank you Fusion family
5,The unit worked right out of the box. I wanted a small machine I could use in the field. Sometimes I need to have plans specs and manuals onsite. This lets me carry them for quick reference. I also wanted it to review photos and edit them if needed. It can handle the work. It also handles web pages and internet streaming well.
3,Received my new Fusion today. So far I am liking very much. Set up was easy. I am now putting in the accounts I use regularly. Have had no problems yet very happy with purchase!
5,Great computer/tablet.
5,If you're a high school/collage student looking for a simple PC to do assignments or just to surf the web but you don't want the hassle of a large heavy laptop this is a great alternative. its has a fast processor and enough built-in storage for a great price. all i need now is a keyboard a case and maybe a mouse.
5,I utilized this tablet as a solution for the customer self-service kiosk. The product is light yet durable enough to place in a countertop stand. I will purchase this solution again.
1,The operating system got corrupted a few weeks after purchase. I was able to install Windows manually however Windows does not find the drivers. The support website DOES NOT have the drivers available for download (like every other device website) only they want you to fill in some information to request drivers (how dumb!)......Well we submitted the request for support 3 times!!!! So far no response for the last 2 months on this product. You get actual support with a Microsoft Surface Go or others. I wouldn't waste my money on this product...not worth the aggravation.
5,love the tablet also a great price
5,My Fusion tablet is a great travel tablet.  Small and lightweight.  It does everything I need to keep up with work emails and has more functionality than I ever imagined.  I am still discovering everything it can do.  I highly recommend it!
5,Just got this thing and so far I think it's fantastic. Over the last few weeks I've gotten the chance to get down and dirty with the device my thing is like this: it's a $250 Surface Pro. Has all the fun and power and not the obscene price tag we steerage passengers can't afford. Really excited to have it and love using it so far!
5,I was looking for something that would be more portable to travel with.  I think i have found it.  Love the size the ease of use and the potentials that i have yet to explore.  Definitely a lot better than a cheaper one of a different mfg that i returned due to a lot of frustration and poor design.
5,This. Fusion tablet pc  is a perfect size take it anywhere and able to do many things i will recommend this tablet pc to my friend
5,I honestly expected the tablet to be larger nonetheless I've been enjoying it. What I love about it is the USB port. I usually keep a file of pdf docs on my drive and I love that i can access my files so easily and so conveniently.
5,I needed a tablet with a full-size USB port and couldn't be happier with my purchase! It is easy to navigate among the various photos & videos and it responds quickly using the touch screen. I enjoyed the first one so much I bought a second as a gift for a friend!
5,1st tablet I have brought and it's working better then my last laptop I really like this
4,I liked the 10" screen and the USB port no dislikes yet. These features make this compact tablet very useful
4,Works well as an e-reader.
4,This tablet works great as a tablet or laptop
5,I have used for almost 2 months and I have no negative review. So far attended my expectations and I'm happy with the product.
2,The tablet is great for the price it's just slow but for the price paid its what you would expect. 0
5,In two days I have had the chance to check the battery and speed (great results). I cannot wait to use this for both work and gaming.UPDATE - The computer is fast even when the coffee shop Internet Wi-Fi is slow. The response from the computer is great glad I purchased the 4 GB memory option. I real time saver for future needs.
5,This Fusion5 windows tablet is the perfect size for my work.  Great price and works fine so far.  I love it!
4,Easy to use
5,Small size ease to use just like my office pc.
5,Love my fusion5. It is lightweight and works well. I have an android tablet but I wanted windows. This fusion is so light I can carry inside my bag. There are beautiful cases - I purchased a zip around one.Love it !!
5,For the price point this is a great PC tablet.  I needed a Windows 10 touch screen computer and this fit the bill perfectly. I would recommend getting the folio with built in keyboard that's designed for this specific tablet as the folio had a special connector that fits the laptop so that you didn't need bluetooth to sync up.
4,Product arrived on and works well.
4,Surfing the web
5,I've only had it for a couple of days but so far it's been better than most of the expensive laptops I've owned.
5,You can't beat this tablet for the price.  Perfect for surfing the internet.  Since I got this tablet I find myself using it more than my PC.
4,Too much buffering.
5,I love this tablet. Battery life screen quality and the touch screen is great! Thanks for such a great product!
2,I got this tablet since I was frustrated with the limitations of my Amazon Fire tablet as I wanted to use the HBO MAX app.  I wanted a device to  view television shows and movies.  Unfortunately I found that like my Fire tablet there is no Google Play store so there are limited apps - no HBO MAX. Also I am not impressed by the sound or volume control.  Therefore I cannot recommend buying this device.
1,I used this little guy with a car mount in my camaro to run hptuners and it worked very well for that nd it performed as expected  for about 3.4-4mo.Now the edges of the touch screen don't register touch when they do it puts the touch FAR away sometimes the other side of the screen. Can't open start and then hit the restart button. I have tried rotating the thing on all 4 sides and it's jacked up.I have tried to recalibrate the touch area and it won't let me because it puts the touch so far away.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Great screen battery life could be better but overall an excellent tablet.
5,Needed a Small windows PC that was portable to run Machine shop software does the job perfectly.
5,I really like Windows 10. Not difficult to figure out. The touch screen is just right. The sound and visuals are great.
5,This Fusion 5 Ultra Slim Windows Tablet works fine and meets my needs.I wish the touchscreen was a little more responsive as sometimes I have to hold the button down to open a file or app.However it's a nice replacement for my Windows 7 PC which will no longer be supported come Jan. 2020
5,This tablet has more features then I expected we like the touch screen and the screen quality. It is much better than we hoping for.
4,So far it has worked fairly well. The touch screen is a bit slow and at times unresponsive.
4,Good quality and value. It is a little heavy however for a notebook.
5,I got this for my cat Whiskers to watch videos.  He is in love with this.  I also use it for myself.  never had a tablet before and am really glad I got this.
5,I was looking for a windows tablet and this was priced right had great features. Touch screen very responsive. No issues with wifi. Picture quality is excellent. So far no issues r all
5,This is the best pad I've purchased in a long time.  I will definitely recommend it to my family.
5,Runs fast for a tablet plenty of storage and easy to use
5,This works great for when I am traveling! I stay in a hotel 3-5 days each week as a travel nurse and this tablet helps me keep in contact with my family. I also use it to watch movies and play games. I would reccomend getting a speaker to watch movies because it is not very loud.
1,Bought this to replace my wife's broken I pad.  Big Mistake!  First window 10 performance was slow and frustrating to work with on this tablet.  Touch screen was difficult to use. Sometimes it would respond to touch commands other times had to tap the desktop icons and edge selections numerous times because there was no response. WIFI is horrible!  Could only get approx 6-10 Mbps when sitting 8' from one of my unifi USG AP's.  In addition the wifi on this table is only 2.4ghz.  Had issues with the volume slide bar showing up on the desktop screen unannounced. When this situation occurred it totally messed up the ability to adjust the audio. Every time I went to move the audio it would slide back to max on its own.  After 8 hours of trying to get this tablet to work I sent it back for a refund.  Bought her another ipad instead.  30 minutes to set it up no issues!!!
5,I am a big fan of this tablet PC. I use it to help tune and diagnose cars using a obd2-USB scan tool. Great windows device for many people
5,The set up was easy. The product arrived on time and works as it should. I bought it because I'm going on a long trip and needed something easy to carry that I can get work done and play games to pass the time. I suggest buying the keyboard as well and you pretty much have a laptop!
3,Just got it and so far it is a little slower than I hoped. Other then that it seems to be a quality tablet for the price.
5,So far I like everything about it. Being a man with larger fingers it's a little hard to hit the proper keys. I bought this for my wife so it's no problem for her. Takes good photos. I would recommend it to anyone.
5,Handy tablet to have by your chair or nightstand to check something online.
5,I wanted it as a cheap alternative to my old iPad. I intended to use it for a little web surfing and some training for work but main reason is to watch movies. I stream on multiple platforms. It is Awesome!!!
4,Perfect item for my business kiosk easy to set up cheaper than any other name brand. Will be purchasing 2 more tabets.
5,The tablet is perfect. I was able to install all my software run windows updates. I am only able to use one Bluetooth device at a time but overall for the price it is perfect for the price and primary use. Also there is a plastic film or a protective cover that can get scratches quickly.
5,I use my tablet for writing and internet research.  This is an ideal lightweight tablet for those  purposes. Easy to set-up!
5,Love this tablet works great for running my CNC Router. Battery last a long time. Would recommend this product to anybody looking for a new tablet.
4,Performed well as a travel computer and reader
5,Have been using the Fusion5 for about two weeks now. Truly amazing how much quality there is in this tablet. Excellent battery life great OS!
5,Light  durable and USB port in place
5,replace both of my Dell tablet with these Fusion5. works great. never had any issue compare to Dell.
5,i have not yet found anything that don`t like. I think this is a  very good tablet
4,Ilke almost everything but not happy with keyboard.
3,one of order item pad  screen been broken . please send me return label to return the items.the pad looks good  so I will order 2 more . I need to return items money back ASAP . thank you .don't know why I can't attach the pick in here .
4,The tablet was very easy to setup. Has plenty of memory and great keyboard.Would recommend it for purchase.
5,This product work as expected.  Screen quality and battery life.
5,My son is using it for games. He is not sure why nothing will download. He had a Samsung tablet A that he really liked and was able to down load alot of games but this one is not letting him . Will keep playing with it. The screen quality is great it’s clear.
5,Perfect! Exactly what my husband wanted and needed to use for tuning of his car! He loves it.
5,Product arrived  fast  it loads fast  dose everything  i hoped  it would
5,The only thing that I can say is the sound is not good
4,I got it today.  I love it it's as if I'm using my laptop but in a smaller version.
5,I love this little devise.  Its super easy to set up and has full function Microsoft Office.  I use fairly complex excel files crewing ultra runners and my iPad did not allow me to use all the functions necessary.  This is as powerful as my laptop and much more convenient.  I love it.
4,Ordered for Windows10 needed for downloading my quilting patterns.  Easy set up and just what I needed.
5,This tablet is wonderful! It's a mini computer. The touch screen is very sensitive. The tablet is beautiful and light. I am very impressed with it.
5,Workd well and sets up quick.  better than most computers I had when you ger
5,Bought this as a gift for my mother she loves it!
5,I teach Microsoft classes from home.  I will use this to monitor the class.
5,Great device for a great price!
5,I bought this product to use during meeting because I did not want to have to carry my laptop around.  This table is great because it has the features needed for a computer but in a tablet size.  This tablet will allow me to be more productive than I am now.
5,i like this tablet because its light fast & has the windows 10 operating system which allows me to do the same things on this that i can with either of my desktop or laptop & its easy for mobility.  its faster then i thought and so far it has far exceeded my expectations
5,Would have preferred clearer indication of lack of keyboard. Otherwise great tablet for the price.
4,Wireless connection slow. Otherwise a good product.
5,Found the Fusion5 10.1" tablet easy to set up and use as a home tablet. It has Wondows 10s. I reserve comment on the s at this time as I'm not so sure about it. But the tablet itself seems to be a good product.
5,Good
5,I’m very satisfied with this tablet. It’s plenty fast enough for what I need. The Windows 10 is not watered down the USB ports work great and the touchscreen works well enough where I won’t be getting a wireless keyboard for it.
4,I have only had this for a couple of days but it seems to be a great buy.
5,Me agradó mucho porque la voy a usar para mi guagua de sonido y video. Es compacta y fácil de usar.
5,I just bought this great value for such a great tablet good quality for netflix or youtube movies it has all the same benefits of a PC it is fast and responsive no bugs great storage space you cannot beat this deal for the value would highly recommend
5,At first touch it feels like it might break easily but after using for about an hour you really appreciate the light plastic shell. The touch screen is responsive and there is enough memory to allow Windows 10 to run. The screen does collect fingerprints so I would recommend a smudge proof screen protector.
5,Have installed multiple programs. Installed a CAD program and my Office 360 Applications. Am able to run multiple programs. Display is nice and so is the interface. The speakers are not very loud but I use headphones most of the time.I am very happy with the purchase so far.
5,Muy buena tablet funciona igual que una Notebook
5,It's a little slow and have to mess with the icons to get the app to open. but other than that it serves its purpose.
5,I have not experienced anything that effects the way I need tablet gir for use
5,So far I'm really liking this tablet PC. Good functionality. Battery has been good. And it's a perfect size and weight for taking on airplanes. The only challenge is the on-screen keyboard sometimes obscures command buttons. I'm getting a docking keyboard for those times when I need full screen access. But overall I'm very pleased.
5,I am  Ham Radio Operator and do a lot of work in the field and Fusion5 Ultra Slim Windows Tablet PC works very will with all the digital applications and Radio interfacing needed. I would recommend the  Fusion5 Ultra Slim Windows Tablet PC to anyone looking for a windows based field unit.
5,cannot download game as i did on my other tablets
5,Works great perfect if you want something like a laptop but want to save money.
5,This tablet has the power and capabilities of a Real Laptop. Storage capacity of and memory pretty good.
5,I’ve always preferred Apple products but recently Windows is really growing on me again. Originally I had purchased this item for work when I go out into the field. However I strongly believe I’ll prefer using this product over my MacBook during my leisure time.
5,I needed to run some software that's only available on Windows. Didn't want to buy a full laptop or desktop computer just to run one program. This was a great affordable option.
5,The Screen quality in terms of brightness and colours and touch experience was perfect. For me it has been the most cost-effective way to get the Windows experience on a Tablet. I know because I also own other Windows tablets from the big boys.
5,La tablet es expectacular  ya es la 4ta compra que hago.
5,Product worked very good. Touch screen responsive worked well in the application purchased for..
1,I received this product September 11th 2019.  I should have returned it the first week.  It did not power on and I had to wait a day or so and then I tried to get it on and after a few tries it worked.  It did this a couple more times over the next couple months.  On January 13 I had it on my desk and it just turned off by itself.  I have tried over and over it it won't turn on.  I am still paying for it and now it is no good.  I am not the only one that had this issue I can see.
1,At first I like the tablet for its size I like that it had Windows 10 and could since to my galaxy phone. The problem...the login screen wouldn't come up half the time so I had to restart it. The touchscreen didn't respond well. I purchased keyboard thinking  it would work better but NO! The tablet had to be perfectly upright without moving at all or the screen would turn blank. I only used the tablet about once a month. I went to use it one day and wouldn't turn on. Wouldn't charge no lights turn on DEAD! I purchased a new battery... Nothing worked. I pushed the reset button tried holding power button and volume button every combination of buttons. Nothing Dead! I don't recommend  this tablet.
5,I got what I expected.
5,I searched everywhere for an inexpensive windows tablet with a full size USB to use as a controller for my CNC machine and LASER engraver and finally found this one. Works FANTASTIC! When I'm not using it in the shop I have it hooked to display my weather station data and it is perfect!!!
5,This Tablet is an awesome addition to anyone's devices. Super light well built and operation is great.
5,Nice tablet works great all features work good. very decent speed.
5,This is not a super high-end tablet computer but for the price it can't be beat. So far all tablet features are working well and for someone who is cost-conscious and would like a product that delivers as advertised this tablet is a great choice.
5,I used to have 8" tablet and have been using for years until it broke.  I choose 10" tablet at this time and it is much easier to operate.  It might be a little heavier to hold it by one hand but I am still satisfied with this product!
5,My tablet arrived earlier than expected. I just received it today.It is easy to set up. The multiple ports enables users to connect a variety of data sources.
4,All is good
5,So far it's working great for me. It came with a screen protector pre-installed which was an unexpectedly nice. Touch is responsive for me so far and I can't wait to start doing pixel art with it.
2,After few months of use:Battery life - about 2 hours.Very slow does not recognizing  any memory cards or other devices.Tech support is not availbe.Trobleshooter  gives error message and doesn't fixing anything.I would not recomend to buy this device. Don't waist your money.
5,I'm just guessing on the 5s. Couldn't get it to boot into Windows. Turn couldn't get it to power in at all.
5,This is a great Windows tabletI would definitely recommend this for those who like to take their tablet on the goI would definitely recommend this for Family and friends
5,Has all the features I need at a great price.
5,Product works great. Been using for about 2 months now with no hiccups.
4,Works good haven't had any problems so far
5,i can use it as windows or on android emulators
5,Just received Fusion 5It's my # 4 tabletSwitched from Android tablet to windows because it is much easier to interact with others devices I haveFusion 5 is lighting fastOperating system works smoothlyIt have experience if desktop in portable versionScreen is brilliant
5,I have no complain on this tablet so far. The touch screen is very responsive & the price is cheap for a windows tablet plus you have expansion for memory. No regret buying this so far. Hopefully they can make 7 inch version of the same tablet.
5,This table work very well and run pretty fast. It worth the money.
1,I loved my fusion5 windows tablet but as of yesterday it has completely stopped powering on. I purchased this less than 6 months ago and have only used it a handful of times (less than 20 total) and today I went to power it up and it didn't come on I thought that was strange because I know it was fully charged and I hadn't used it in a few days. I figured the battery may have drained so I charged it up for a few hours came back and still nothing. I know it was a tablet in the cheaper side but I had really hoped to get more than 5 months of use out of the thing. Has anyone else had this problem? Is there a way to fix it without getting it serviced?
5,The product is very good. Whan I saw the low price i was not sure that could be a reliable and good quality stuff. I took the risk. Using it and with my client/server application i can say that it's working perfectly. Good stuff.
5,My first touch screen. I have moved from Desk tops to laptops and now a tablet well the laptop is still a good go to machine I deserve a tablet. This Fusion5 is right for me. Light weight powerful and a touch screen.
5,Just getting started wth this sleek and lightweight tablet but so far it has been perfect!  I wanted a Windows based tablet that could take on some Microsoft applications.  I loaded up Word Excel etc and everything  works wonderfully.  The battery is amazing.  Very happy!
5,I needed something I could easily carry around just to write on and this tablet was the perfect solution. I didn't have a lot of money to spend so I was thrilled to find the Fusion5. It satisfied what I wanted it for and more. Plenty of memory and storage space.
5,This tablet is perfect for my work space because it is small and compact but has the same capabilities of a small computer. The screen brightness is a little light and I recommend a screen protector.
4,Touch is not that excellent. Speed is fine.Getting hot quick.
5,Got this to control my CNC machine. So far it works great.
5,Had to wait for re-stocking on Amazon because the demand for this tablet spiked.Price features and connection options are perfect and hard to find with other tablet brands.I would again recommend this FUSION tablet for others and another for myself as well!
5,I absolutely love the tablet. It works great  and I have had no issues.
5,This is a good item. It is easy to setup. They shipped the item fast and arrived in will packages box. I would say but this item.
5,screen quality is great set up was easy.  I would buy this product. I'm not a wordy  person.
5,Ok so I love this tablet. It is smooth and responsive. It is also so convenient to carry around for school and work. I would recommend this tablet if you want a tablet that isnt too complicated.
5,Perfect size and speed for what I need.
5,The FUSION 10 is a great value for the price and ideal for a convenient travel tablet.
5,I bought it for my niece. When her boyfriend came to help with initial setup he said this was a real computer. Excellent performance bright display quality sound and flashlight response. Great for its modest price.
1,It stopped working! I hadn't done anything out of the ordinary. In fact I was literally only using it for 2 apps. I wasn't even using it frequently. Yet it just stopped working. T.R.A.S.H. I'm super annoyed.
5,Easy to set up with nice bright display.  Very nice product.
5,I own two fusion 5 laptops and they have performed wonderfully so I figured let me give the tablet a try. I ordered the keyboard also.  I wanted something similar to a surface pro without the price tag.
5,Fast. Effective. Quality. This is a tablet you want to buy and it's at an excellent price. I am happy with the purchase and what I've used it for. To have a device that has windows 10 on it for this price is awesome.
5,Purchased this tablet as a gift for my husband. He loves it. He can surf the web and watch trail cam videos. Tablet is lightweight and a nice size for viewing. Full size USB option is great
5,So far im obsessed
5,After extensive research I gave this tablet a try since then I have ordered 3 more for my family. They are great everyone loves them and compliments how well they do. Highly recommended.
5,what I liked most about the tablet is its fast and I am able to play games on it that I could not play on my desktop computer.
1,WHEN it worked it was super slow and constantly freezing up. Probably used 5-6 times in 2 weeks and now will not turn on. Won’t even charge. It’s also very poorly made. The screen is warped on every corner and look like it would fall into pieces in a heartbeat. Definitely returning
5,Bought this so my disabled son could use his EZ-Keys software on it.  It is just like having a mini Windows 10 computer at your hands.  Working great so far.
5,i'm so happy with my new windows tablet i tried everything so far i didn't encounter any problem the touch screen works good its very responsive the connection for the inetrnet so fast the tablet itself its really impressive i wish to have one more tablet like this....
5,So far working Great very easy to handle. Perfect size screen Quality is good battery last a lot. I'm using it for work and has everything I need. I'm completely satisfied with my purchase. I recommend everybody that needs a Windows laptop this product.
5,The office software is very convenient and the several ports for A/V connection make presentations easy. Graphics are clear screen is bright and interface is friendly. Would recommend.
5,I was looking for a tablet to replace my other tablet. I wanted to upgrade everything I wanted in a tablet I found in Fusion5. After a lot of comparing I made the choice of Fusion5 and I am so happy with .
5,We use the Fusion Windows Tablet PC almost daily in our business which requires a great deal of travel.  It's the perfect size easy to use and plenty powerful for all of our needs.  Very pleased with this purchase (and the great price)!
5,Worked well right out of the box.  Completely meets my needs.  Very happy with my purchase.
5,Very nice tablet so far I've bought to trade using MT4 and it is running greatly.UPDATE: I'm still loving this tablet but I just woke up and the screen was cracked. I've never dropped it by the way. But oh well what can I do.
5,The fusion is a little heaver than expected but most of the controls are in the upper left hand position which keep my figure from doing stupid things.
5,As described easy to use good graphics and sound. A overall nice tablet!
5,Great tablet for certain environments. I purchased the tablet for PowerPoint previews and light network usage.My first table came damaged from the factory. It was slow and sluggish. The replacment was quick and responsive.
5,Good compromise between quality and price.
5,I like that I can sync the tablet with my windows 10 laptop and that it has the same system I'm used to.
5,This is the perfect size tablet... easy/small enough to travel with yet also large enough to be able to see and work effectively on it. Still learning the ins and outs of a Windows tablet but so far it is working great. Excellent tablet for the price.
5,I needed a tablet because of the portability.  This tablet fits the bill.  It's slim and very light weight.  Nice size screen fast processor.  Plus it's affordable!  I would highly recommend this tablet for anyone looking for a Windows based tablet.
5,This is a great tablet. It’s everything I needed in a tablet.
5,This is a really nice little tablet and lived up to my expectations.  I installed a 128 GB memory card and i am able to use the tablet just like my notebook with Windows 10 seamlessly.  Have encountered no problems or limitations.  Great product!
1,I havee purchased three of these units and returned them all as having a system crash on every unit. I thought three would be the charm but it wasn't. I would not buy from this company [VastKing] again.I bought them for the price but you get what you pay for. In this case I got three units that each failed either immediately or in a few days.
5,I got it earlier than I expected and my kids they love it ... especially long lasting battery . Oh boy oh boy oh boy
2,I have had this tablet for about 2mo now and initially it seemed to be a pretty nice product. 2 times now it has had issues with turning on. This last time it took about 10 min or so and even when plugging in it didn't indicate it was even charging. I would not recommend this pretty poor quality when it comes to basics of just getting it to turn on. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because the apps including windows 10 are nice.
4,Can't fine a case that's fits
5,Great inexpensive tablet. Exactly what I was looking for.
4,Works  great was as expected  for the price
4,Works well. Packaged good.
5,Microsoft edge is slow? and windows s mode blocks to many programs can't use Google Chrome  or you have to exit S-mode and can not return..
5,Son loves it! Easy set up. Quick shipping. Exactly as described!
5,I don't like just having window apps to pick from. Just a change from my lap top. Take some getting use to. It is slim and light weight with good resolution.
5,This is my second tablet. I had an android 4. something. It had to go. I am used to Win10 so I think i like this tablet more.  I use it in the car. It renders video perfectly. Runs smooth.
5,This is a great product and value for the money. Light weight and easy to bring from meeting to meeting. Responsive and easy to use. I definitely recommend.
4,Bought for my husband. He loves it.
5,This portable PC is amazing and it's perfect for all tasks anytime anywhere. It works just like a normal PC and the weight won't bother you. A smart cover with keypad would've made it the best ever companion...
5,Using in construction yard for parts look up and other machine parts
5,Received this item very quick. Works like we need it to.
5,Good size and easy to use. Like Windows over Android. Can use it with a keyboard or a touch screen tablet.
5,Exceeds my expectations.  It boots up fairly quickly runs for 6 hours or more in my application (using it with FieldLynx to record track and field results).
5,For personal and job use.
5,Fast shipping and great quality. Thinking about buying another one!
5,So far so good.  Tablet is exactly as described. Havent had much time to "play with it" but I am confident that I will be able to use it with my embroidery machine - which is its sole purpose.
1,The screen looks used. Does not hold a good charge.  Sometimes when typing the pointer jumps from one end of the screen to the next causing information already typed to be either deleted or repositioned on the document.  Bought it for my business for efficiency but I'm spending more time coping with this device's inefficiencies.  2 months after purchase this tablet won't turn on.
2,I like the mini hdmi port but the screen failure is really disappointing.
5,I love the lightweight feel and high speed processor. It was well worth the money. Definitely recommend it.
5,Love it perfect for your shop use
5,Bought this for my wife. It replaced a microsoft surface rt. Works great and has held up well. Nice budget tablet.
5,The product is good. Ilove it.
5,found the instructions for use confusing narrator was hard to understand.
5,A bargain just what I needed at a price that didn't break the bank. Performs as indicated. A joy to own easy to work. recommended!  plan to buy a 2nd.
5,Over all I really like my tablet.
5,we got this product and it is great and easy to use. I love it...
5,A very decent product for a very good price!
5,Great tablet and a fantastic price for what you receive in this powerful little tablet. Applications open and close well with little to no lag. Don’t get much storage but a 128gb sad card remedied that. Overall very pleased with my purchase.
5,Totally worth the money. its a little slow but I expected that. So long as it lasts 2 years I will be extremely happy with this purchase. using it for a photobooth.
5,bought for my husband who isn't tech savvy  he uses to watch all the different streaming video services and surf the web. Sound and Video Quality is great
5,I bought this tablet just for casual use and it's perfect. It's great for surfing the web and watching videos. Its large enough to watch videos easily but also a size that's easy to pack in a purse.
5,Nice little tablet. Also ordered the keyboard case. Makes easy work of the little tasks where pulling out the big laptop is a nuisance.
5,Love this tablet.  Touch screen is very responsive processor is very sufficient and runs tablet smoothly.  No issues at all overall I'm very impressed with the quality and functionality of this tablet.
5,I like that is a Pc and a tablet
3,First one failed. Stopped charging and died...This is the second one.. So far so good.. Crossing my fingers
5,Wanted a laptop replacement and this fits the bill. So far I’m very happy with this purchase!
5,About same size as an IPAD and navigates smoothly through Windows nice and easy to work with.
5,I got this tablet to do data logging for my car and that specific reason only. It does what I bought it for and have had no issues.
5,I like the size and weight of it! It’s screen quality is great also compared to other tablets I have had.
5,This device performed as I expected. I use it to remotely control my garden railroad. I can carry it around the yard. Wireless connection continues to work as I roam. Perfect. All aboard!
2,So far the tablet works ok. The docking keyboard I purchased with it will not work! I am very dissatisfied with that
5,Did Not Come with a Screen Protection
5,I ordered this tablet to use in the car with my audio system. It has a regular sized usb port and a micro sd card slot. Works great and feels solid. Also shipped quick and arrived 2 days early.
5,Tablet is easy to use and functions well.  Just what I needed.
5,Very happily and excited with my tablet!. Enjoy the size and very useful!
5,Slow but I mainly use it for reading ebooks and surfing the Internet.  Occasionally I play movies on it.  For my purposes I don't regret the purchase.
5,The tablet fusion5 is awesome it's super fast reliable and the battery is long-lasting I can connect an endless amount of other electronics too it without it slowing down great product
4,Works great. Very enjoyable. Good purchase.
5,Happy with product considering price good
5,All good no problems is fast big screen good metal quality some other options that windows tablets don't have at the price range.
5,Searched long time for windows operating system that did not cost a arm and leg. Fusion was fight price and had all I needed to work with

3,Excellent article while it was running in two months the battery died

5,Product is compact with a good sized screen and nice features. Close to having a laptop.

1,I have had mine for 10 months and it is dead.  Will not turn on will not charge etc.  Not a good quality tablet.
5,I have been looking for a tablet that had enough RAM to run programs on without lagging for a long time. I am very happy with its performance and battery life.
5,Liked Fusion 5  easy to used.
5,I mainly use this product for drawing. It's a neat product! :)
1,This overall product left a lot to be desired. It was very slowThe battery wouldn't hold a chargeSometimes the touch screen wouldn't work (I had to connect a mouse and external keyboard at times)The camera was in black and white grainy and off centerI returned it and will not purchase again.
5,i love how easy this is to use
5,I really like the Fusion5  it's going to take a while to learn how to use it.  It is like my desktop pc.
5,Bought in December and so far it does everything I ask of it and more. My whole family loves it!
5,Easy set up. I have Windows 10 on my home computer so it's an easy transition to the tablet when I need it. Great price! It is my first tablet and I am impressed!
5,I own the 2nd one.  Good resolution
5,Performs as advertised. It is surprisingly fast even with all the office programs loaded on it. I did install a 128 GB card for additional storage for music and photos.  No additional drivers were required.
5,got here fast looks nice and smooth. cant wait to play with it later
5,very nice tablet!! very easy to use. order came right away. thank you fusion 5!!
5,Timely delivery works well
5,The battery life is very good with this unit and the screen quality is very good in all light situations so far. I would recommend this unit to a friend.
5,Love the size and weight. Touch screen does not work well with my big fingers so a stylus would be nice. Windows versions work better with mouse functions for use of the right button functions.
5,This tablet is perfect for daily use!
5,Can't beat the price and I have had no problems with the Tablet. Processor is faster than I expected.
5,Overall this product is very useful and functions great for the number of features it has. I like that it has a USB 3.0 port as well as built in wifi and Bluetooth capabilities.
5,It's a very nice tablet and easy to use.
5,Works perfect. I brought this for my girlfriend and she is really enjoys it.
5,It is light great screen resolution sufficient memory for my needs and costs the same as the Dragon Touch i10x I had while greatly exceeding it in speed and power.
5,How was surprised for the size and the price the quality that you get from this place it’s a great bye This is my second purchase in two months I love him
5,Excelente compra la pantalla es amplia super delgada y rapida!! Es una mini computadora. Funciona perfectamente
5,It does everything I want it to do and has pretty hardware qualities.
5,I like this because it has windows 10 and I bought it as a backup for my laptop.
5,I will use this product for music records as a performer and other things I may want to keep record of.
1,Despite charging overnight the tablet will not power on after using it for a few months
5,So far so good. The tablet arrived before the estimated delivery date. Everything has worked great so far. I brought the optional keyboard and it works good too. Very happy with purchase.
2,Doesn’t hold a charge long and not very user friendly.
1,I thought it was a good tablet for the price but after a week the screen is split up with vertical lines and i cant read text. I rolled back video drivers installed different ones and of course i tried the newest ones first. I reinstalled Windows through the factory reset but same problem.I noticed that the problem persisted during boot so i know its not a software problem. Tried different resolutions too. Can't find anything specific like it on google either.Anyways I'm very disappointed because everything else about this tablet was solid for the price.Update 2/27/2019They responded quickly and they are issuing a full refund for the tablet.
5,I have used this for 4-5 weeks and like it. It starts up well surf's the web well. The battery last a good long time and recharges quickly.
1,It looked nice and sleek in the ad and just what I needed. NO! I couldn't even finish the set up! Wouldn't hold a charge and you have to hit each key at least 3 times to get it to do anything. The screen is NOT responsive at all. Sent it back within a couple hours of getting it. Garbage. If I could give it zero stars I would.
5,This Windows tablet is great! I was semi-skeptical because it was such a great deal but I've got zero complaints. Great screen resolution connects with peripherals and looks good too.
5,The Fusion was purchased for specific use with my mid arm for an automatic quilting program and it is perfect!  Great size battery lifeeasy to use and has 64 GB's.
5,This is perfect for browsing and  play online board games. Its fast and has good screen quality. and affordable.
5,The speed of applications on the tablet was better than I expected having used many other Windows Tablets before.I would recommend this product with no reservations.
3,I am not that familiar with tablets but I like it.
3,Working slowly .  Many contacts are needed to activate the screen
5,Cant wait to use it!
1,Randomly shuts down and have to do a hard restart. Initial windows configuration is horrible. This has just been a god awful purchase.Update 05/03/2019:Well I made the mistake of restarting it. The tablet is now just sitting there with the screen twirling and reading 'restarting'.Oh and by the way Return window closed on Jan 31 2019. Product support window closed on Mar 14 2019This tablet is an unbelievable sad piece of technology.05/15/2019:It is now dead. Got about 5 months of use. $40/month and untold grief to have this unbelievably sad piece of technology and now have a brick which will not work at all.
5,Touch screen
5,Sooooooooo great thank you definitely recommend
5,Great product value and best computer I've owned.
5,Was surprised how quickly I was able to get it set up and running.  Showed it to a friend.  He asked me to send him the amazon link!
5,Love it! Been wanting a tablet for a long time now.  Meets all my needs.
5,Great functions the sound is very good without headphones. works really fast when set to performance over battery life. Very happy with item.
5,Is a wonderful tablet and super useful
5,It's a good product fast RAM 4gb it meets all my exceptation just perfect.Thanks
5,This tablet is priced right and does what I need it to do very well. I use it to drive a long arm quilting machine.
1,I truthfully did not like it at all. There was no charger in the box. And the screen was already scratched. That tells me it will scratch very easy. The tablet was cheaply made. Looks very fragile.  I already contacted Amazon to return it.  This is the first time I've ever returned anything. Amazon is as great with returns as they are with order & deliveries.
5,Bought this as a gift for my wife. She loves it!
5,Our household mainly use IOS and needed a windows pc/tablet for light tasks. This one does that and more.After installing many updates it’s running very efficiently.
5,Great value and powerful machine.  I use it for ableton 10 fusion 360 mame and other emulators and it's fantastic. Had for 2 months now
1,Do not buy these tablets. they seem like great deals but after a short period of time the digitizers crap out. this happened to 4 out of the 5 i ordered so i sent them back for warranty and only got 2 of the 4 back and then shortly after i put the 2 back into service the same thing happened to them. i tried to ask for a refund because of the multiple issues and the longevity of the issue and of course i was rejected. i had a feeling they were scammers right from the start when in their first email they asked me not to get amazon involved.
3,I just received this as a birthday gift. So far so good. Beautiful picture quality.
5,Muy buena calidad útil para hacer trabajos de oficina
5,Very good
5,My wife loves it!!! Amazing tablet great clarification and very easy to use! Her only complaint is external speakers could be louder .. overall she loves it 👍☺️
5,Everything is amazing
2,Received this today. Went by the reviews which goes to show that you should take the reviews with a grain of salt. The touchscreen is not that effective. Apps are limited! The keyboard unless you make it very small takes up half the screen making it hard to see what you are typing. Speed is slow. Not impressed at all.
5,Love this sturdy compact tablet. Easy to use exactly as described and came with surprise screen saver! Should have ordered from this company a long time ago.
5,All in all great for the price
5,This is a great tablet for a number of applications. Use it for work and home.
5,Overall I like the tablet
5,Has all the latest technology but for half the price of what you would pay for a larger brand name. Good Quality and even a one year warranty!
5,I purchased this item for my husband and he loves it!  Works great for surfing the web online shopping and emailing.  Fast and easy to use.
5,Excellent product I like it
5,la recomiendo
5,This tablet works much better than the previous Tablet we ordered.  Plenty of storage built-in and more ram make this a worthwhile investment!
5,Fast processor good battery life and sharp graphics. The full size USB is a great extra.
5,I've had the tablet for a couple of weeks now and use it everyday. I haven't had any issues so far. Delivery and packaging was also excellent.
5,Llego a tiempo y en buenas condiciones. Recomendado
5,Excelente
1,I tried to do a factory setting  and it froze I am not sure if all my personal data has been compromised. please do not buy. not a good tablet. buyer beware
5,Great product I use it to do my purchase orders. It works great!!!
5,I ready like my tablet quality is very good 👌. Thank you
5,Best Tablet PC ever ! Worth buying !
5,Purchased 4 more tablets for use in our medical office they are a good size and do everything we need them to. Perfect for patient intake app.
5,Very Nice Tablet
5,Excellent product at a very reasonable price.
5,Great tablet for the price and it will do anything a laptop will do. Love the fact that its windows 10
2,It was ok
1,Since this tablet is one of the new tablets sold with the following warning "Windows 10 S Tablet PC" that indicates the operating system is not the real Windows 10. Apparently this is a stripped-down version that only runs certain Apps fast and shows the HOURGLASS forever for all the other APPS. In other words this PC is a piece of CRAP.
5,I love my new Fusion 5 tablet.  It is so light weight.  Good speed and lots of storage!!
5,This tablet was a good deal.  I bought it for use with my amateur radio equipment and it met my needs.
5,It is a huge improvement over the Fusion tablet PC - 32GB Storage 2GB RAM because you can play games without getting frozen.
5,Just what she wanted.It has more options than her Kindlewhich she also  dearly  loves.A great product if you to upgrade.
5,The product fits my needs for study with excellent battery life lasting the whole day. it is easy to set up.
2,Very unsatisfied with this product.I have owned it less than two month and have used it very little. The touch screen feature quit shortly after it arrived so it could not use it until I bought the additional let board. The touch screen still doesn't work. If the read any way possible I would return it for my money back.
5,I use this product at work. I like having the look and feel of a laptop in the Fusion5 tablet.
5,Excellent tablet. Reasonably priced.  My wife uses it in her marketing business.
5,Did everything I needed it to at 1/2 the cost of others.
5,I was really surprised with how much I love this tablet!! It came quick!! Awesome 👍
5,Good computer for  any use.  We use it for projecting music lirics in our church.
5,very nice tablet pc..  works awesome. well worth the purchase and money..
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Guys dont waste your moneyThis tablet is so slow...A patato will run faster than this tabletThe speakers are horribleAnd the audio is so badMy phone speaker is better than this hall tablet Also this tablet gets hot wile watching a video at 1080piAnd that is not allIf you play a video on 1080pi the audio glichesSo please guysDont buy this trashI warn youDont make my mistake
5,Got my husband this tablet for Christmas and he haven't been able to put it downthe quality is above any system I ever bought.
1,It is very slow. I can barely do anything with this. It freezes even when I just use the internet browser
5,Fast and easy set up. Very satisfied with the performance
1,Far from what is presented in the commercial. Totally unreliable tablet. After one day of use I realized that the tablet was not charging the battery. I think the manufacturer spent more money on packaging and advertising than on the tablet itself. Made in China. I made two big mistakes. Firstly because I bought this tablet and secondly I bought it from Zikwell. If you return a defective device to Zikwell you pay to send it back.Stay away. Save your time money and nerves.
5,Kids school work is a little slow with internet
5,Good response time. Nice screen. Speakers are quiet so hook up a bluetooth speaker if you want.
3,Its slow other than that i like it
5,Seems like it chugs with a few programs but for the price for what it is and what it can do it's perfect!
2,I got this due to the fact it was a deal. But I was wrong. The screen is slow to respond it processes slow then fast and it gets annoying fast. I gave on it and got a surface pro. END OF STORY.
5,l'm  using the tablet the first time and I love it.
5,The tablet works exactly as it is described.
5,I like the size and weight. I would buy it again. So far it’s been a nice tablet.
5,Fantastic product for the price performs flawlessly and by adding a micro-SD it is a real handy tablet
5,Decent speed for surfing the internet able to handle multiple windows without freezing up. Great tablet for the price.
1,When I opened the tablet I found a big scratch on the screen and trying to get someone to get back with me on the return to get a new one has been a big challenge I don’t know if I would reanimated it to someone else because I haven’t been able to try it out
5,This was the perfect fit for me to work from home!
5,It's convenient for me to have when I'm out in the field to write up documents and send out works great so far.
1,I baught this in January and it has been great.  Went to turn it on and nothing!! I thought maybe I didn't plug it in all the way. Plugged it in and the blue light didn't come on so I changed it to the USB charger still nothing. I am in my second week of school and this. I am not happy and will update after I contact the seller.
5,Was everything and more
5,All around great Windows 10 tablet. Holds charge well lightweight solid performer at a great price.
5,Exactly what I need. A full size USB3 port in a windows 10 tablet. Perfect
5,Great for simple functions if a Windows 10 device is needed.  Inexpensive and works as expected.
5,This is a great tablet. Perfect for on the go homework and office use! Windows already on it! Excellent Tablet!
5,I love it!! It works very fast and it is extremely efficient
1,Piece of crap!  volume was way to low no matter i tried to exceed the volume. i was told to by the tech rep to reset it but still dont work. my samsung galaxy j1 was way to loud on this one. this pos is not worth for purchase.. i bought it due to it's positive reviews- but i was wrong. im the victim of this lemon gadget.
5,Purchased product for on the go work  and email. Tablet is working great so far. Nice product for the price.
5,Good size for travel and viewing. Nice bright screen; easy to set up and use.
2,This is the most expensive tablet I have ever bought. And it is the worse. Always A problem getting online In searching the web.  Page just not found coming up recover page Or takes forever to Get to the next page. No more windows😤
5,Comparing to the 1st gen of Microsoft Surface Pro this device is awesome for affordable price.
5,Very good speeds and like the portability of having a fully functioning PC in a tablet.
5,Really nice tablet it is very nice to have windows on a tablet. 5-stars
5,The person I bought this for is very happy with it
5,It's pretty darn good I like it alot
5,Very nice windows tablet
5,I love this Tablet its Handling a big game lime the Sims 4 on it with no hassle.
1,The size is adequate. The battery life on mine is 4 hours tops and takes all night to recharge. Very short life even if left plugged in while using. Touch screen sensitivity is poor and overall performance is very slow. I purchased the Fusion for two  reasons the full size USB port and the price. I’v had this tablet a little over a month and now it’s dead. I’m now going to break lose some money and buys Microsoft Surface.
5,Bought this for grandson. He loves it and user friendly.
5,I loved it
1,Had this delivered to the wife in Oregon.  Thought her friends could do what she wanted to do with it. Apparently not.  The battery is not holding  its charge.  It is past the 30 days so now she is sending back to me to see if I can get it to work the way she wants. Just thought you should know!
5,I use this daily for work and it works great!!
5,Works great for my needs looking forward benefitting from it weeks months and years down the road.
5,Works great small compact with a lot of features
5,I am enjoying my tablet. I am still learning how to use it.
3,Speaker output and volume not as expected.
5,For online search apps and documents
5,This is exactly what I was looking for in a tablet for my job.
1,Absolutely terrible screen looks great battery lasts a good while too but good god it's the slowest thing I've ever used. I have at least a 3-5 second delay when I tap on the screen so trying to type out messages or look for anything is a pain. I'm not sure if mine was just defective or what but I'd avoid buying this. All I can say is look elsewhere before buying online.
1,This product is horrible. I received it and set it up the first time. It seemed good. Then I went on a vacation out of town and left the tablet at home. When I got home it had drained thr battery. I recharged it and it will no longer turn on at all. It's completely dead.I tried returning it but can't do it through Amazon.
5,Love the ease of using this tablet. Nice sized screen and USB port.
1,We purchased two. Needed them to show pictures tonoir clients.Such poor quality in general. Really disappointed. Read the reviews and figured it would work for our store. But it takes about 2 min to load one picture.So disappointed. Wish I could return them but by the time we got to give it some time to test them and use them it was too late.
5,I really liked the tablet it woks great and looks great.
1,I lost all my information and projects that I was working on. It just stopped working one morning. I went to charge it and it will not turn back on.
5,Very happy with my purchase
5,it was very easy to set up it is good quality and easy to handle
5,I'm very happy with the product. Makes it easier that carrying around a laptop.
5,cumple con lo que ofrece buen comportamiento del procesador y la batería dura bastante.100% recomendado
5,Love it!
5,I use this for travel and at home.  It is the perfect windows tablet.
1,I bought this tablet on dec 2 2019. Today is june 1 2020. Literally 6 months! And it is dead. I went online twice with it. That's it. Honestly it has been used to play solitaire in the bathroom.  Today went in to do my thang.....dead.  doesnt turn on.  Just a $200 POS!
5,Wife enjoying it
5,Great tablet arrived quick. Suits my needs perfectly. Good price too.
5,Love how easy this computer is from setup to use
5,no issues i an be portable now when i work :)
1,Bought this to replace another windows tablet we have used for years for a web app that had a cracked screen. We used it twice and it died. Haven't been able to get it to charge or start after that. It was too late to return it when we figured out it wasn't working any more.
5,More features than i expected...battery life fantastically  last long
1,i have the new one and the old one. they suck. i'm lucky to get them to even boot up half the time. oh...something went wrong :( . blue screen. No explanation  no help. just broken.
5,Recently purchased product for skype calls. Camera and mic work great. Nice product for the price.
5,I really like this tablet the battery life is great..
3,Good for my karaoke.
5,Exactly what I was looking for to run my quilting machine
1,I would not buy this product again after not even a year of having this product it has almost completely stopped working. It is super slow and many of the functions do not work as well as they should. I would buy a nicer table for this amount of money. Do not recommend.
5,It is good.  I use with a sewing machine.
1,This is like 1995 dial up slow.  And not intuitive at all.  Shuts itself off and you have to press a button to start it again.  Most of the time you have to manually click on the keyboard icon to search google.  Crazy.  I hope I get my money back.  This belongs in the trash bin.
5,Works great.
1,Bad quality wouldn't charge and we tried two
5,Very user friendly .  Just what I wanted!  Perfect!
1,Complete Rip off.No drivers can be found.Died 1 month after return window closed.This is complete trash!!
2,Did not keep it long enough to determine battery life. It ran too slow and would not open some websites. Returned in 24 hours.
5,Very fast beautiful screen extremely happy

5,Accesible de facil manejo y multiples opciones.
1,Unfortunately it stopped working after about 5 month. It already made trouble from the beginning. When I called the support team they told me that this is normal after an update. It happened a few more times till the tablet finally stopped working completely after a very short time.
5,overall great Tablet for the price.
1,I had a review detailing the problems. But why bother? It's the worst device I've ever owned. Unstable. Slow. Just terrible.  Never again.(Had to post this from a laptop. The tablet won't boot. After six months it finally gave up.)
5,Nice tablet
2,Trying to use the touch screen can be frustrating
5,Satisfied
1,I don't recommend this product at all! It doesn't work because it is so slow! I can't seem to do anything on it not even something as simple as downloading a game. I'm sending it back!
5,Excellent tabletOnly weak sound volume
1,I really had good hopes for this product; great value nice form factor and well appointed.  Unfortunately returning because it is stuck in an endless setup loop.  Will write more as customer service receives the defective unit.
5,I love it
5,Very portable
5,This item was purchased as a travel computer. It is light and easy to use. Battery life is adequate. The price was affordable and fair. It came with windows 11 a must for me.
2,Its volume sucks and the face chat is bad
1,Completely unusable it’s so incredibly slow
1,Desktop operating system on a tablet with almost no modifications to the shell. VERY Clunky. Audio Piss-Poor!!Go buy a cheap laptop and save your money. Unit not worth $20 much less $200!!
1,This product is terrible on customer support and it’s false advertisement I bought this and the USB port was inoperable I can’t even plug in overall 100% do not recommend you might as well buy a surface pro
1,I recieved a "new" tablet covered in scratches and it was clearly used!  So slow wouldn't load or play half the apps all around disappointment.
5,good value for its price
1,Do not buy complete junk only worked for a week and sound quality was terrible.
5,Very good product
1,Battery has already died and won't take a charge. Verified that the cord /plug is working properly. I'm very disappointed. Otherwise I think it was a good tablet.
1,Nothing gets me madder than the pay for new get used and it crash within 30 minutes and had to factory reset plus the Android software is old. calling it junk would be giving it a compliment
1,bad news
5,Nice product
1,I have owned this for less than a year and the battery will not charge.  Would NOT recommend this product and I sent in a request for a refund.
1,At first I loved it but it didn’t take long for it have problems. The pop screen stopped poping up didn’t respond to some commands i’m Going to send it back
1,I returned this tablet. The screen bad bubbles all over it. Yes they were under the screen protector...... bubbles under the touch screen. All I wanted it for was the USB port.
1,Buy something else. The table will not come on at all now and it crashed often. I am sorry I bought this.
1,Nothing works right
1,After having this tablet for just two weeks the screen malfunctioned. See images. Extremely disappointing. I am surprised considering all of the positive reviews. Proceed with caution.

5,Everything works great service to the product use it all the time!
2,EDIT: 7-11-21 I tried getting on this device last night it was really hard to navigate like the screen wasn’t acknowledging my finger taps at all. I looked in the corner & it had the yellow dot for an update so I assumed that was the problem. I choose “update & restart” & BAM! Couldn’t get past the PIN/Login page. It freezes anytime I tap the text area to put in my PIN number & I’m lucky if I’m able to do a hard shutdown as I’m not always able to pull the screen down to confirm shutdown. This was the first time I’ve used it since I wrote the review & the only thing it did was sit on the charger in between. I’m sure I can send it in but having to send it for repairs after less than a month of ownership is upsetting.ORIGINAL REVIEW:First off I just want to say I really like this computer & I’m super glad I got it! BUT I must also say -  This was originally purchased by our company’s Amazon account when we were looking for a *tablet computer* fast enough to use our payment system with. However it DOES NOT HAVE ACCESS TO GOOGLE PLAY/Android App Store. Being the shop webmaster I should’ve noticed that it has Android HARDWARE not software so that was my mistake not Fusion5. I just wanted to put that out there first & make sure no one else makes the same $200+ mistake. It’s a great computer especially for the price just kind of a bummer that it only has the very limited Microsoft App Store & doesn’t have the ability to use Google Play apps or games without an emulator like Bluestacks - which actually works well on this operating system if that’s what you’re looking for - but keep in mind that emulators do not have the ability to use Bluetooth or other hardware so we were unable to pair it with our payment system speakers etc. through Bluestacks. Hence why I now have my own personal computer-tablet to work with! Other than the app thing this computer is a real winner for me! Surprisingly very little lag online even with multiple pages open YouTube videos & livestreams. Pages load fairly quickly & it is easy to set up & personalize. The camera is not impressive but decent on both sides & I would use it in a pinch. No connection issues with either internet/WiFi or Bluetooth devices so far in the couple weeks I’ve had it. Decent sound too but doesn’t get very loud if you’re looking to bump music so you’ll need a Bluetooth speaker for that. Movies play with very little lag as well. The battery life is a bit of a letdown though. It has may be 2-3 hours of use tops before it dies completely & takes a while to charge. But I think it charges better with a mini USB vs. the cord it came with so pick up one of those. But this also has an “ease-of-use” & a lot of other features that even high end laptops are lacking. Updates went smoothly & it really does operate just like a keyboard-less computer. I will say I’ve had some difficulty switching between apps/screens though. I have to turn it from side to side to get access to the “back” or “full/mini screen” buttons at times especially when I enter full screen whether it’s on an internet browser or another app. And when I have a split screen with one app on one side & another on the other I have even more trouble trying to get back to the single screen Home Screen or whatever. That’s coming from a webmaster of 15+ years so if I have trouble your toddler or grandma will too & I truly don’t feel this is an appropriate system for beginners at all. Probably not the best for gamers or those looking to use it all day every day but this would be great for someone looking for a little personal computer or tablet something that travels well or a backup for home or work. With all of that in mind keep your expectations realistic & I think you’ll love this computer. Highly recommend & will repurchase Fusion5 products again in the future.
4,This tablet is a second device for our household with our primary device being an iPad. While it’s taken a little to get acquainted with the setup and layout we are happy with our Fusion5. While it’s not quite convenient to navigate as the iPad it’s definitely a good value! If you’re looking for an affordable tablet option this is a good way to go. One thing we use it a lot for is streaming movies onto our TV or playing music and podcasts via bluetooth speaker all of which it works great for.
4,I liked the sensitivity with the touch screen and that I can plug a mouse in. for gaming it is a little slow and needs upgrading a little but over all great for the price.
3,I've always bought windows based tablets hoping for the ability to run windows-based programs when needed.I bought this fusion5 in the 2gb of ram model and I was disappointed in how it streamed video so when the 4gm ram model came out (this one) I upgraded hoping that would be an improvement and it still struggles.It's not my internet speed if I use my phone or a laptop with 4g of ram it streams just fine.It's light and it's a windows based tablet but it's slower than a laptop and doesn't stream like my 5 year old samsung tablet not even close.  So that makes it kind of unacceptable.
1,If you need to reinstall Windows 10 you'll find that you're out of luck.  Fusion5 offers no support with obtaining the drivers to use the touch screen enable auto-rotation etc.  Try contacting them and you'll only find silence.  This device will become a $250 paperweight.  Luckily I had a second tablet so I created a backup image from that one and reinstalled it on my table that needed Windows 10 reinstalled.  So I'm copying this review on all of their products since it's probably the only way they'll fix this.
3,That's. Grate
4,You're unlikely to find a tablet with all this one has to offer at a cheaper price. I needed a Windows compatible device for my job - otherwise we are Apple people. So separating the exceptionally slow and unnecessarily difficult Windows OS from the tablet itself it's a great deal. The camera isn't excellent. The battery runs down somewhat quickly but otherwise I'm satisfied. The amount of RAM and GB were a huge draw. And I was able to find a compatible keyboard for a reasonable price. Definitely recommend.
4,I got this to be able to sit up in bed and play games in bed after some news from Destessing news. I love being windows Im gonna be able to do whatever I want  One thing I dont care for is the Stylus it comes but id also ordered  differant one of those The keyboard docking station which I find must have is on its. I cant get all technical so all I can say neat little machine after a days messing around with it. and a very good price.
4,This Windows 10 tablet with its 4GB DDR RAM is so much faster than our 2 year old Windows tablet that we replaced.  I also like the Windows 10 OS which makes opening any app just a click away.  Everything about this tablet is high speed and no waiting.
4,Product did everything it said it would
4,have one loved it did what i needed  screen cracked from who knows why or where never dropped  becareful handling it .. i never abused it ..sad  was great wont buy another screen to delicate ..
4,good productuse it for our car repair & truck rental businessjust downloaded Norton & added 128gb mem cardso far so goodhaving a hard time finding rubber shock cover
4,It was a gift for my classes.  After a few technical issues it seems to work fine now.
5,I only have had this tablet for a week but I have to say this is is the best tablet you can find cost-benefit i read some bad reviews but they were from an older model you have to buy the new model with 4gb of ram and quadcore.It is very fast the touchscreen respond very quick and  the battery long a good time.Just some recommendations for the people of fusion5:- you should have an official case that protect the tablet i saw one but covers the turn on button and headphones hole.- you should have an official screen protector i had to search and buy a protector for another type of tablet.- for the next model it could be good to add a lock button to turn off the screen and lock the session (with only turn off the screen will be good too).
4,Great for what we need.  Compact durable and very fast prosessors
4,EN GENERAL BUEN DESEMPENO PERO VOLUMEN DE LOS SPEAKERS BAJO
4,Wife uses it for work
2,This tablet is no good. I bought this tablet and it has not worked for even seven days. It shuts off during use and it does not restart when I want it to. At times the screen becomes fuzzy with what appears to be static lines only. I have tried to contact the Seller but without any success. A friend of mine bought one and is having the same issues. I do not recommend that anyone buys this product.
2,Received unit and it looked ok until the battery went low. The unit will not charge. Charger and cable check ok but will not charge. Pin in unit is not bent so problem is not that. Will take to Walmart and look for a different brand.
5,Frankly I was a little concerned with some of the negative reviews but having now used the tablet for a week or so I'm pleasantly surprised.  Very pleased.  Windows tablet works great.  Only minor issue is the user manual.  It could be more technical.  Small concern.  Purchase with confidence.
1,Plugged into electric no charge. Plugged into USB no charge. Cannot be fixed. Took to reputable repair shop and they said they can only get Apple parts. No other brand. Ugh no return after 30 days. Lost almost $300 with case that it didn't fit in all 4 corners and never installed screen cover. Waste of my money. Sad.
5,Excelent product Fussion5 and differential tablet with Windows 10
5,I like everything about it with the exception of the UK english settings that come with it. I had to figure out how to switch over to the US version which didn't take that long. I didn't realize the keyboard settings were so different. I like the Windows 10 home version so I switched over to that version. It sync's with my Windows 10  laptop which is awesome.  So all in all I'm glad I ordered it. None of my friends have one yet so I can recommend it if anyone asks.
5,Setup and updates went perfectly. Win 10 S mode was not a problem as threes is a simple removal tool "free" in the MS Store. (Need removal to install the reading App for Amazon and others that I use.) The touch screen responded well to my touch. Weight is good for my travels and the additional memory slot is a plus.
5,The only reason I didn't give battery life 5 stars is I haven't had the tablet long enough to fully check that out!There's nothing about this table that I don't like (unless it's Microsoft's dumbing down the operating system but that's not the hardware vendor's fault). This comes with Windows 10 "S" so its not a fully modifiable Windows. But for a tablet it is easy to use and compact. The screen is responsive and has good color. I bought three of these and like what I got!
1,I went to buy an IPAD instead. Poor quality on screen at everything you look at it. If you play a movie on netflix at night you literally can't even hear the sound at max volume. need bluetooth speakers. disapointed.
5,For the price it works extremely well. It is fast and does everything and more  my more expensive laptop does. Love it a lot and recommend for those on the go moments or just sitting in your chair. Battery life is good and screen is crisp and easy to read
5,Words alone cannot express my true feelings about this tablet pc but here goes..... This tablet is freaking amazing I was able to set it up straight from the box and without having to charge it first. Btw the set up was a snap and the speed is Ridiculously quick. I plan to use it for my small business. Thank you
5,we needed a tablet for daily work ours drivers are careless did not want to spend a lot this one will be the one from now on get the job done battery life lasted all work daywe go through a lot of tablets in a year due to cracked screens lost ect...so we will slowly replacing with these since they get the job done and are cost effective
5,I replaced my RCA tablet with this one and hands down its awesome.  Screen clear sound good and it does everything i need it to do.  The only problem i have with it is that it doesn't take the greatest pictures. Good Job!
1,the tablet has failed to see our WiFi signal. all other phones computer televisions and fully WiFi compatible and operate just fine. i will be asking amazon to credit my account and will hope i can return the tablet.
5,Muy bonita  llegó súper rápido recomedado
5,My 11 year old uses for school play.  Purchase the key board work great.
5,Having a USB port opens up many new things you can do now that you can not do with a standard table. Plus working with familiar Windows 10 improves productivity
5,I am programming a micro:bit and this machine has all I need. It has windows 10 a full USB port and the makefile app works as well as my desktop apps. I can find no fault for this fine product.UpdateI have used this every day for 17 days and am very happy. It is truly a small miracle. I have added a 128GB sd card to increase my storage. The battery life is amazing 10 hours.
5,I am so glad I bought this for my wife 10" Windows 10 Fusion5 is Ultra Slim it is fast very easy to go from one screen to another it's just what she always need thank you
5,Wish it had a sim card slot
5,Good screen quality battery life.
5,It's a great tablet basically a laptop really very beneficial it's a bit slow but other than that a great value
5,I use it I like it i had other tablets before this is the best 1 a bought
5,I could not be more happy with this purchase! This is a great windows tablet for the price! It is like having my PC in front of me only way more convenient! Very happy with the functions of this product!
5,This is a Christmas gift I gave to my husband today. Santa came early. So far it seems to be what we expected.
5,This was a gift for my husband he loved it!! He was excited about the larger screen making it much easier to read sheet music. The bonus is he can also watch movies on it.
5,Initially purchased the 2gb ram tablet however I very much prefer the 4gb and it does not disappoint.  It has been smooth sailing with an easy setup.
5,Used it for a lot of stuff. Completely Loved it. One thing that I didn't like but fixed was sound.😀😀
5,I Iove this tablet. It has definitely exceeded my expectations.  I highly recommend it
5,Fusion 5 fwin232+ is a great tablet I installed Google chrome Firefox Garmin express Calendar Calculator Groove Music Photos are nice and everything runs perfectly.I highly recommend. T.W.
5,no problems so far A+
5,Just received this week works great!
5,I like that it has a USB port.  Easy to setup up and use.  Like it so much I brought a second tablet for my spouse.
5,Bought this for my husband and so far it's done everything he wants it to do. No complaints. Great for the price.
5,I bought this for my father he is 74 years old. I helped him set it up and navigate around it a bit. It was easy to set up and easy for him to navigate. He loves it and says it is so easy and has everything he needs on it. He does the occasional Word doc and Excel sheet and browses the internet and FB. He also listens to music on it and watches youtube videos. This is perfect for him. He also transferred his files over and had no trouble and is thrilled that it has the room for his current files and so much more! He likes it so much he is looking for a cover upright holder and a keyboard for it because this is now his laptop replacement!
5,This thing is great. I did not expect such high quality for the price it is. I bought this tablet solely for HP Tuners and it works amazing. When I got it it was in Windows 10 S mode for added security. Which means that you can only download apps from the app store. But with a little bit of research I figured out how to disable S mode and now I can download any web based software. To disable S mode log onto your tablet tap the windows button on the bottom left of the screen tap the settings icon just above the windows button. Then tap Windows Update towards the top right of the screen. Tap "Activation" on the list of selections on the right side. Once you get to the activation screen there will be an option to "get out of S mode" or something of that wording. Tap that and it will send you to the play store where you will finalize the switch out of S mode. After that I believe there is a mandatory restart to put it into effect. Done!
5,I originally needed a second windows 10 device to read another windows 10 hard drive. The Fusion5 Plus for 200 dollars I experience as a tremendous asset. Of course I can connect to USB. 3.0 a flat 2.5 in. hard drive and read the files and all that windows can do and very well. So to anyone interested all the tech stuff means the Fusion5 Plus is really a delight to have and for only 200 dollars total windows 10. What could be bad ? once the device is out of S mode it will download apps outside the Microsoft store like virus protect or VPN. But that"s good. I sorta hope future versions include a screen that is more scratch resistant where cleaning the unit with windex and napkins won't leave the unit with scratches and oil prints that make the unit look used quickly. 5 stars!
5,I received my Fusion5 Windows Tablet a week ago. It performs quite well. It is relatively fast and operates well. I have connected a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard that I had sitting around. Connected easily and works great. I wanted a tablet that could replace an old laptop and this fit the bill but I am not a fan of the Android tablets. The Fusion5 links to my desktop PC and does everything you would expect a PC to do.It is well worth the money.
2,I loved everything about this tablet except its functionality. I sent the first one back because the digitizer had a problem when pressing a couple of the keys on the keyboard a different key highlighted. The second one was sent back because of the wifi dropping out. Tried 3 different networks in 3 different places with the same results my laptop and other devices had no problems on these networks.
4,I am using this in a kitchen environment it is not a high end computer but as a workstation it has access to local storage and internet for both a local program and research if needed. I would of course prefer an item which never had to be recharged but until we reach that perfection this item with overnight charging seems to be doing what is needed.  It's slim design and quick response will allow us to store this item and use it in small spaces as well as allowing use in other rooms as needed.  The plug will be unobtrusive enough to work well.  Not excited that it is locked to Microsoft Store but is quite functional if you overlook the lock or remove it on startup.  They promise it will not be reactivated.  Overall a nice slim functioning machine.
4,I bought the 64gb model and for the price this is honestly pretty damn good for a tablet in this price range especially as Android tablets are becoming more and more rare and I refuse to buy an Apple product. It has plenty of ports including USB-C a micro sd card slot for expansion and even a micro hdmi if you want to connect it to a larger display (good luck finding that on most tablets) the specs are pretty good and most importantly its running a full version of Windows 10.I absolutely consider myself a power user so I tend to hate the heavily controlled and limiting mobile OS's (again I will never buy Apple) so it's a big deal to me that this uses a desktop OS and yes you can install different versions of Windows on this if you want something better than Home (though be advised Windows seems to disable the touch screen while installing so you may need a usb hub to connect a mouse/keyboard and the usb drive containing your ISO).It's certainly not the best tablet out there or the best Windows device but for a tablet at this price range I'm pretty happy with it.
5,My Lenovo 10" finally died. Not surprising. So I found this cute replacement and it takes a while to reconfigure and install all the browser plug ins plus get rid of the Windows 10 version it comes with that is so ANNOYING :-)Day by day I am getting this to be a real W10 tablet that is usable and I'm starting to like it. If you have patience and skill to reconfigure this nice tablet go for it!
5,This is my third attempt in owning a tablet that will fit my needs and this one does.  I LOVE THIS TABLET!  I can access the internet thru my cell phone via Bluetooth so no wires.  I had ordered 2 others before ordering this one and was very disappointed on their performance but this Fusion tablet is well worth the money spent. Don't waste your money buying those cheap ones as you will be unhappy.  I plan to purchase the keyboard for this next.
2,At first I gave this tablet a 4.5. However after having the tablet for 2 weeks the glass broke for no reason. Just broke. Tried to reach out to the manufacturer several times. No response. Eventually Amazon sent a used one with a caveat I wouldn't be able to exchange if something was wrong with that tablet. Well something was wrong with it. Spent over $200 for the tablet and probably only used it for a month. No refund. No usage....
5,I am not very computer savvy and I wanted a tablet that had windows in it to use while watching TV and I needed Excel & Word programs mainly. I love this tablet. It is perfect and for the price one can not go wrong. I can easily plug my USB storage (thumb drive) and transfer files. Love it!
5,I love this little PC! My kids needed a laptop for school so I gave them mine and bought this as a cheaper option.  I mainly use it for bill pay web surfing and watching movies.  The  4 GB RAM speed is good for these purposes and it has a ton of perks...I can print use a wireless keyboard and also extend the screen to monitors in my home office.  The shipping was fast and I’m very satisfied with my purchase.  I highly recommend the Fusion to others who are trying to save a few bucks but still need a versatile tablet with good speed.
4,I wanted a simple little tablet that was Win 10 based.  This was priced nicely and is highly effective for what I needed.  I would call it a good value.
2,Nice little tablet. Limited apps on Microsoft app store.After 2 months of use I'm revising my review. This is a terrible tablet. It's slow and it does not play well with any programs.
4,Just recorded today. So far the tablet is great. One thing I have noticed right away is that you need to be “dead on” when you are using the touch screen. Sometimes when the font is small and the radio button is small it’s very difficult to hit it exactly. Maybe this is adjustable I just haven’t looked into it yet. So far everything else is working flawlessly.
5,I love it. Everything works great and the best thing is that it has USB so I can connect my GoPro and my hard drive. Its smaller than a laptop and does everything what a laptop can do. It's not the fastest on the maket but for that price it's amazing.
5,in the hospital right now using free wyfi everybody loose connection haven't lost it yet. Touch screen very easy to use. have bluetooth keyboard very easy connection
5,I use this tablet for my CNC machine. At first I was worried that it is not gonna be powerful enough for my purpose. But it proved me wrong. I run my CNC softwares and Google Sketchup on it sometime at the same time and it handles them very well.I wish the screen was a little bigger but that would have killed the purpose of being so portable.
3,Details do not make this clear and multiple comments indicate it DOES have USB-C.  That is not true and this comments should be flagged as misleading or simply wrong.
5,So far seems good for a cheapish tablet. Had to put in s mode to get the programs I wanted but seems to be working fine now.
5,There is nothing that I didn't like works perfect and love the product so far I will write more review later as I use it more i recommend buying from these guys
5,This is a great tablet. This is my family's second one. The first one is still working great so we bought another one.
5,Works great exactly what I needed.
5,This will be a great addition to my desktop and laptop.
5,Came really fast!Looks great-really excited to use this product!
5,Trabaja  bien creo que no se puede traducir al español y por el precio esta bien
5,I use for save music.
1,This tablet works only for one week not good
4,Luv it....took some getting used to but great switch up between phone & laptop 😎
5,Excelent product for pricing!!! Worth it !
5,I purchased this Tablet because I needed to RUN a CNC Router and did not want to subject my Laptop to the dust in my wood shop. This Tablet PC offered a sealed unit that could handle the dust and ran a true version of Windows 10. I intended to just load the software to run the CNC ...but I ended up loading MS Office as well as a few other programs I frequently use. I was shocked at the capability bundled into such a small package especially given the price point of this item. I have only had it a few days but so far I am more then happy with my purchase!
4,I ordered the fusion5 10.1 in Windows 10 tablet because it had the best ratings for the cost. I needed a compact window system for programming my ham radios in the field The first thing I did was kick the S out of Windows and put in a 256  card I'm very impressed how the machine boots up the feel and weight appear to be good quality and I did buy the Finti protective leather tablet  case that fits perfect. I have ordered a fusion 5 keyboard because of the fingerprints and smudges you get with a touchscreen we'll see how that works out.All in all a great little tablet for the price I don't think you'll be disappointed. KH
4,This is a solid Tablet Both Touch screen and Keyboard are very responsive Battery life seems to be very good.. Looking forward to Flying my quad copter with this tavblet.
5,I cannot state enough how amazing this is! I use windows so this syncs well across my devices. Perfect for my life!
3,Dislike the Sound Quality cannot hear any speaker output sound it's so low you need a hearing aide even with the tablet up to your ear. Hate I can't get Google play to download my Apps which that's what I purchase it for.
5,The screen is larger than I thought
5,i really like this tablet good quality clear screen very happy with purchase.
5,I love everything about it
5,It’s a good tablet on a budget. Performs well
5,Great for taking your Windows OS on the go.  A nice little package with great screen clarity and a comfortable weight.  It's power hungry but the power is well used for a full Windows 10 64 operating environment.  It's not as powerful as a desktop computer but the power to weight ratio makes it a slam dunk winner for computing on the go.  I'll buy another one when the time comes.
4,So far the tablet has achieved my expectative speed is ok the heat coming out is manageable.There are a couple quality things that are not perfect but I believe are ok for the market price range like one of the screen corners looks like there is not a correct attachment between screen and touchpad there were a couple of minor scratches on the back which are not visible unless you use a very bright light device.Also there is one thing about the touchscreen feel it feels like not so smooth and my finger tip cannot slide "frictionless".But as I stated at the beginning the tablet is very good for the price so far so good. I will just wait a couple more months to see if it is still good I've read some reviews that after some months the tablet is unresponsive.
5,My wife has gone through (broken) 4 laptops. All she does is play games check emails and shop. But what she does is balance the laptops on the arm of her chair plugged in and the always get dropped and broken. So I bought her this tablet. It does everything she wants it to do. Sits nice and flat doesn’t need to be plugged in all the time battery lasts a long time and it runs her games. Perfect. Should have bought one sooner.
1,It doesn’t work and the seller hasn’t even replied
5,So far so great! 😁
5,Nice to have a windows product that delivers to Canada. Is an excellent price and it was shipped and delivered in amazing quick time. Amazon.ca  who takes a week or more to deliver anything to my rural residence only 2 hrs from Toronto area where their warehouse is could learn a lot from this excellent seller.
4,Screen quality good operating system fair vary usable
4,I think it's good for simple browsing and video playback anything basic you're looking for.  Cameras are pretty decent.  Like the back finish of the tablet as well.  Would recommend to anyone who needs something that covers the basics.
5,I purchased the Fusion5 to access the internet quickly. There are times when I need to research something and don't want to go to the desktop PC or one of my laptops. It is fast enough for what I need it for. Can also watch YouTube and Rumble videos easily. Would recommend this tablet for anyone needing quick access to research.
5,The tablet was easy to set up and is powerful enough to use with auto desk fusion 360 forCNC router work
5,perfect
5,I'm using this as an art tablet only. Meaning I uninstalled lots of useless apps making it a bit faster than usually. Very budget friendly. And worth ever penny. If anyone is wondering I am using clip studio paint pro. Just make sure to get an art stylist a glove will not work though. Keep that in mind. Also make sure to get a screen protector. Does not come with one which is a bummer. But all in all good investment.
4,I am very pleased with the Fusion5 win232+. Has many great features. Comparing my husbands apple iPad to this tablet I actually have more. Like a USB port HDMI port  and a c port. It also has a really nice feature a sd card slot making it easy to expand. His iPad was 3 times plus the expense of this one. You can also get this same tablet with more ram bigger hard drive  lots of options. Happy with mine. Well worth the price.
5,good condition
4,This is the first Windows tablet I have purchased.  Very nice screen.  Just wish I could buy a screen protector for it!  I like the full size USB it has!
5,The products were professionally packaged and they arrived on time.The items functioned perfectly and they were just what I wanted
5,Bought for the wife she loves it
5,Haven’t had this tablet long but it works great for what I need it to do.
4,This tablet is a LOT of bang for the buck.  It's great when you have Windows 10 on your portable device so going back and forth with your desktop PC isn't so cumbersome.  Though the processor seems fast enough for a portable it doesn't match the speed of some Android units.
5,Very nice tablet for controlling my cnc.
5,Perfect.. just what I needed in a little computer.. has all the functions of a regular laptop or computer.
5,El producto cumple con los requerimientos para lo cual se adquirió.Deseo saber como obtener una factura para legalizar contablemente la compra?Quedo atento a sus comentarios
4,I bought this to replace an aging HP 2-in-1 Laptop.  As I travel quite a bit I figured it made more sense to get a Windows tablet as opposed to another laptop to avoid the inconvenience of having to put away my laptop prior to takeoff while watching other passengers continuing to do things on their tablets.  The screen on the Fusion5 10” is slightly smaller than the screen on my old laptop but it is much slimmer and lighter and runs Windows 10 effectively.  And when paired with cloud storage via Microsoft OneDrive and Google Drive I'm able to start work on my home desktop and then switch fairly seamlessly to continue working while traveling.  As a tablet it's a better size and much more convenient for streaming video and music than my old 2-in-1 laptop.  I wouldn't recommend this as a replacement for a regular computer either desktop or full function laptop but for the frequent traveler who needs to do some work while on the move it's a good alternative.
5,I was looking for some small good tablet to replace my laptop and I think this tablet is the best for its price.  very happy with the purchase.
5,Solid workhorse works great emails and team meeting
5,It was exactly what I was looking for all the graphic design work on the go. It's a nifty Windows 10 touch screen tablet. You get all the bang for your dollar without the price of a Windows Surface.
4,I’ve bought around 50 fusion5 tablets with windows. They do exactly what I need them to and are cost effective. Easier to use for serious stuff than Android OS tablets which makes them a great buy.
3,10" Windows 10 Fusion5 Ultra Slim Windows Tablet PC- (4GB RAM USB 3.0 Intel 5MP and 2MP Cameras FWIN232+ Windows 10 S Tablet PC) (64GB)  • Good display  • Good after-sales 'repair' service  • Terrible speakers  • Micro-SD card reader problem (solved by Windows Update)  • WiFi sometimes weak  • Bluetooth problems (not resolved)A prime day deal offered a version of this tablet for under £100 but it only had 2GB of RAM and a 32GB SSD. In my experience running Windows 10 with only 2GB of Ram is not really feasible unless you are very patient So I opted for the higher-spec 4GB/64GB model. I also bought a 64GB micro SD card to increase storage capacity and also the optional docking/keyboard case.Firstly it is not possible to set up this tablet without using a Microsoft user account although once setup is completed a local administrator account can be created and the initial set-up account deleted.On completion of setup the Micro SD card was not detected (the socket is very fiddly anyway because the card needs to be pushed in a long way before it clicks into position). However after running Windows update a few times the SD card was finally recognised and all now works OK.The speakers are as others have reported awful. The packaging talks about a ‘built-in HiFi speaker and mic’. Thin squeaky sound is not my understanding of what ‘HiFi’ means.Since I knew that the internal speakers were going to be terrible I also bought a pair of portable Bluetooth speakers. A single speaker paired successfully with the tablet and worked fine. However two of these speakers can be used for stereo by pairing them with each other first and then pairing with the tablet and I was unable to get this to work. I got a message about “Incorrect PIN” even though I had never been asked to enter one in the first place. (The same two speakers paired successfully as a stereo pair with my Windows 10 desktop machine and with my Android phone.)A few Google searches showed that Windows 10 can be a bit quirky regarding Bluetooth devices but none of the solutions posted on line worked. Perhaps the initial pairing of a single speaker was the cause of the problem but there did not appear to be anyway to completely reset the Windows Bluetooth configuration without re-installing Windows.Having previously completed a successful clean install of Windows 10 on a friend’s Asus tablet I prepared a USB flash drive (using Microsoft’s Windows 10 media preparation tool) that would allow me to reinstall Windows 10 on the Fusion5 tablet. On completion there were several ‘unknown devices’ on the system. This is not unusual for a ‘clean’ install of Windows because special drivers are sometimes needed and nearly all ‘big name’ manufacturers have a web site from where the relevant drivers and documentation can be downloaded. However Fusion5 seem to be either unable or unwilling to offer this service in fact their web site’s ‘download centre’ does not offer a single download so the only alternative was to return the tablet to them for repair under warranty which they did with great efficiency and courtesy albeit that this just involved restoring it to the original state.The first thing I did on receiving the repaired tablet was to ‘clone’ the tablet’s internal SSD to a spare external HDD so that I could always restore the ‘status quo ante’ in the event of future problems.Further experimentation still failed to pair the stereo speakers with the tablet. A pair of high quality headphones appeared to pair but no sound could be obtained through them even though they work fine with other devices. In desperation I disabled the internal Bluetooth adapter (which appears to be a RealTek RTK8723) and plugged a USB Bluetooth ‘Dongle’ (Based on the BroadCom BCM20702 chip) into the tablet’s USB port. After installing the relevant drivers (available via Windows Update) the adapter worked perfectly and what is more the speakers and headphones could now be paired in stereo mode without any problems so clearly the problem was caused either by the built-in Bluetooth adapter or by the lack of the correct drivers for it.WiFi performance was patchy. Most of the time it seemed reasonably fast but occasionally when streaming video or music from a server on the local network it would lock up causing buffering delays.So the lack of customer ‘self-help’ support for this tablet is for me a significant negative factor. Research showed that this tablet is actually made by Truvo in Shenzhen China but their web site is equally unhelpful in that it offers no driver downloads etc.So basically the tablet has some issues concerning basic functionality. There are work-arounds but they involve extra time and money. Fusion5’s UK support is very efficient but making relevant software available for download would have saved them and me a lot of time! Also by the time you have added better speakers and a Bluetooth dongle and factored in the time and effort spent in hunting for workable solutions you might be better off buying a more expensive ‘big name’ brand which has better software support.
5,I bought the Fusion5 10.1” 4/64 tablet to replace a  p  a  i  n  f  u  l  l  y  s  l  o  w  5 year old netbook I used on vacations and coincidently a portable DVD player that gave up the ghost during our last vacation.Being a sceptic and in view of the modest price I read and digested all 173 (at the time) reviews and 120+ queries coming to the conclusion that a mere half dozen or so less than good reviews were unlikely to reflect the true nature of the unit.I have been using it for a couple of weeks now and am more than pleased with my purchase. From the outside it seems as well built as any of the competition (apart maybe from the odd ones with metal cases) and with its price/ memory ratio is excellent value. It is apparently as fast as my Win 7 desktop albeit with the odd slight delay with touch screen selections. Frankly I am not impressed with Win 10 but this is hardly the fault of Fusion!Some have commented that the on-screen keyboard covers a large proportion of the screen. I hope they have by now found out that the keyboard icon at the bottom right permits moving the keyboard and changing its size. Keyboard response is immediate with no delay.Win 10 does not have the capability to play DVDs. Microsoft have cunningly removed this facility from Win 10 and expect users to pay an extra £12 to buy an app from their online store. Better to download VLC media player which is free and according to experts far better than the MS offering.Need an office program? Use Libre Office or one of the other excellent freebies.If you don’t like touching and dragging on the screen or using the trackpad of the optional keyboard a Tecknet or similar wireless mouse works perfectly.Regarding playing DVDs though not over complex this was not a plug and play process. I bought a USB DVD player off the auction site for £10 but plugging directly into the tablet (and using VLC media player) it would not work. I queried this with Fusion who replied immediately explaining that the tablet used a phone chipset and could not provide the power for the external unit.Next purchase was a powered USB hub and a USB to 3.5mm male barrel jack cable to connect to my TomTom sat nav power supply (5volt DC). Bingo! DVD player runs normally and tablet now plays DVD faultlessly. NOTE: Do not use an extension cable from the PSU to the hub as the voltage drop will cause the tablet to attempt to power the DVD player which will then not function.  Standard 1m max. cable only.I concur with the comments on the speakers but do any tablets produce decent sound? Sound  is adequate for normal net surfing but for music or DVDs better to add an external speaker (wired +/- £5 bluetooth +/-£8).Someone commented that there was no light to indicate charging. My unit has a small red LED above the screen. On when charging off when charge complete.One thing I really wanted was the ability to run Google Earth as my desktop hasn’t the graphic capacity to run the latest version. GE Pro runs perfectly on the 4/64 64 bit Fusion tablet.The Emartbuy wallet/folder for the Fusion is great value at £10 particularly if you have Amazon Prime for free delivery! It protects the tablet well the sockets are all accessible from the side and it converts to a deskstand to hold the tablet at a sensible viewing angle. The tablet will need to be removed from the folder to use the camera though as being a universal folder there is no port for the camera to “see” through.To sum up a great value versatile portable computer with good customer service from Fusion. All these units are made in China including IPhones and Galaxies so given reasonable intelligent care there appears to be no reason why the Fusion should pose any more problems than the competition.
5,The product is great exactly what we needed. Would highly recommend.
4,After unpacking I immediately plugged in for a charge 7 hours recommended. Couple of micro usb adapters and charging unit supplied. Many updates required....  Update Windows feature 20H2 has a known problem it tends to roll back after installevident from many computers where I work. However installing 21H2 feature update on this tablet it sailed through all the updates. Touchscreen is responsive. 1 click button on Windows app page this can now be removed from Win S. Your choice.Connected seamlessly through my home network allowing me too control PCs with ease. Highly recommended
4,I was on the market for a tablet but the specs on paper for the majority of the competition didn't look too appealing to me. Especially for the £200 price range. Therefore I decided to give this one a go.The unboxing experience was high quality and after turning the device on I was impressed by how great this thing was.Here are just a few points based on my experience:The battery life is quite long-lasting. Inside the device is a huge thin battery that covers most of the back of the displayThe screen resolution could be higher at just above 720p resolution it's not quite Full HD but I felt it was fine for the most partIt runs the Netflix app really well and I managed to get some decent functionality out of Amazon Prime on the browser. However the YouTube website felt slow and sluggish and I would recommend using a third-party YouTube app from the Microsoft store.It worked pretty well for simple web searching tasks and for checking Facebook or Forums.The port accessibility is really useful with a full USB 3.0 port and a mini HDMI port there's the possibility to plug in external Hard Drives or anything else you might want to plug into a Windows computer.The touch screen didn't feel too responsive and the typing experience on the on-screen keyboard felt laggy but this is to be expected considering it's a Windows device (you can always connect your own keyboard)I was able to have Discord and Skype running on the machine to take calls or receive messages but Skypes interface feels really sluggish while in calls if you have a little patience you might manage it (I think this is just Skype's problem though)If you are looking for something smaller and lighter than a netbook or laptop but still want to be able to have Windows 10 this is for you. Though if you are looking to have many applications open or to use professional recorce intensive software you might want to look for something higher end.It works great as a little computer you can just take with you wherever you go.It's perfect to use as a little computer you can have next to your bed to quickly access the internet or messages or even watch Netflix before sleeping!But if you are looking for something to play games or do heavy multitasking this device doesn't perform too well.Perfect for light tasks such as messages emails Netflix!
5,I bought the Fusion 5 tablet as an emergency replacement for my big desktop that had blown its PSU (under guarantee). I ordered it with the docking keyboard a 128GB TF/SD card and a screen protector. It all arrived in 2 days which was handy as I had to produce some Word docs urgently for work. I installed a spare Office 365 (you get up to 5 on the standard subscription) and I was away. There was some other software that I needed that wasn't available from the Microsoft Store and so I had to change from the installed Windows S operating system to Windows 10 Home (a relatively simple couple of clicks from the Settings menu) and so was able to install my favourite photo editor. The 1200x800 screen is fine for simple stuff but for big docs and spreadsheets it is a bit small and so I decided to connect it to my 27" 4k screen which it would do which is fine for Word Excel and photo-editing but had real trouble with hi-res video. I didn't try it with a spare 1080p screen but in retrospect that might have been a better decision but hey-ho. I did have some trouble with the docking keyboard in that if my thumb just brushed it when typing (especially the space bar) I would find myself typing words in the wrong place! I think that's my problem with trackpad laptop keyboards in general and I really missed the right button function. However for simple surfing when sitting on the sofa it works fine (as does the screen keyboard). For working at my desk I decided to plug the tablet into an 8-way USB adapter and plug in wired mouse and keyboard which along with powered external hard drive meant that I could type normally and access my backup files off the drive. We hadn't had a tablet before and so the Fusion5 is a bit of a happy novelty and so much easier to use than our ancient smartphone.So what did I like: It works well for most things (e.g. word processing web stuff email) the price the mobility full-size USB connector HDMI connection to external (up to 4k) monitor.What I didn't like: An HD screen would be good though the 10" works perfectly well and you can use it for YouTube. The trackpad was annoying for me but something I could adapt to (I couldn't work out how to switch it off which would have been useful!). The tablet speakers are very quiet but work fine with headphones or external speakers.Overall the Fusion5 is a pretty decent tablet and laptop alternative to my £2.5k desktop. I couldn't do CAD or video editing on it and running a 4K screen was marginal with respect to screen refresh rates (and made video unwatchable though worked fine on it's native screen). The battery life was fair when not plugged into the USB adapter or 4K screen and I got 6hrs of Word processing as an experiment (though most of the time it was connected to its mains adapter). It is a good general-purpose mobile solution. I didn't use the onboard cameras except for Skype (which was fine except the speakers aren't very loud). It upgraded to Windows 1903 just fine and now with my desktop back it is a really useful mobile (sofa train meetings) solution.
4,I bought this to replace an aging Samsung NC10 Netbook for use both in tablet mode and with a keyboard.  In fact the screen on the Fusion5 10” is the same size but it’s much slimmer and lighter.  I was keen to find a device with a minimum 4GB / 64GB to run Windows 10 effectively and I added a 128GB Sandisk Ultra microSDXC card to get maximum storage – moving the standard documents music pictures and video folders onto it to leave maximum space on the main C:\ drive.Other reviews have commented on the excellent specifications so I’ll just comment on my own usage in desktop and tablet mode.For desktop use the compatible docking case with keyboard has a magnetic coupling and a clever supporting stand and adding a Bluetooth mouse is useful for any serious work.  The magnetic coupling isn’t strong enough for the tablet-keyboard combination to be carried around open or used when sitting on a sofa but this is when tablet mode is most appropriate.The tablet is nicely finished but really needs some protection when used without the keyboard case so after careful consideration of dimensions I bought a Leather Case for Sony Xperia Z 10.1" Tablet which fits almost perfectly (just slightly over-sized in width) and has a hand strap and viewing stand (see photo) - https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00E9WRNBO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 – the power and up-down buttons are obscured but still usable when pressed through the fabric.  I already had a separate Bluetooth keyboard and find it handy to use this instead of the keyboard case though the latter is more responsive when typing quickly.The tablet suddenly went dead after a couple of weeks but Fusion5 quickly supplied a replacement so it’s reassuring that their UK-based customer service is very responsive.  The replacement came with a completely up-to-date Windows 10 installation.Overall I’m very pleased with my purchase especially at the price and like the flexibility of having the additional XperiaZ case and separate keyboard as well as the compatible Fusion5 keyboard case.
4,The actual tablet works well though as often is the case with tablets like this a screen protector is a must. The down side with this is Windows 10. Although this is an improvement on Android (I previously had a Fusion 5 with Android on it which continually broke down despite my own and the company's best efforts) it does suffer from a number of faults which are basically where Windows 10 is designed to do a number of things that make it difficult to work with. Anyone that has read my writings about Windows 10 elsewhere (LiveJournal The Register etc.) will know my views about Microsoft's "dataslurp" and while you can install a number of things that stop this it is a pain still as a number of these things also stop bits of the system that you actually might use.That aside however it does work quite well for data consumption. My own use is web browsing and movies (the latter tends to be a mixture of MP4 and MKV filetypes up to and including 1080p) and I have yet to see the system get into trouble. A quick application of Classic Shell and a few tweaks under the bonnet relieves me of the ad gubbins that Microsoft wants to inflict on me and my browser of choice is Waterfox which works well here alongside VLC for any video use.In fact the only problem I came up against was making a safety of the load which could not be done to an optical drive. No doubt some will use the cloud for that but personally I found that I could do it if I provided some extra power to the drive (my drive is a Buffalo BRXL-PC6U2 which I've had for some years now) through the second USB cable all went well.I later added a folder/keyboard to the system more for the folder than the keyboard but I'll go into that elsewhere.
4,Reasonably built Windows 10 operating systems tablet PC. Most tablet PC in market within the price range of the Fusion5 runs Android which are mainly ARM architecture based. One of the reasons for my purchasing this tablet was to use it as a front end for some of my portable USB based test equipment such as the Saleae Logic analysers. I also use sometimes for reviewing schematic diagram and PCB board design using tools like KiCAD (Electronics Design Automation tool) while commuting to work on the train. I also use for reading technical books as I don't find the current eReaders on the market well suited for reading books with schematic diagram or programming language code.In fact most of the applications that I used are Intel x86 architecture based so owning an Android tablet was not a choice.Pros1) Battery life when device is asleep is excellent. Sometime I just leave in my bag for days just to switch back on and notice that the battery charge is still very good2) Very slim and light without the a case3) USB 3 portCons1) Very poor selection of slim cases that would snugly fit the tablet I don't think they exists. I was given a free case as a courtesy gift but I had to get rid of it started to create marks on the tablet and also made the tablet to appear very bulky and weighty. This case didn't even have a cut out for the back camera which I thought was quite annoying.2) No Stylus pen which would have made the user experience much more pleasurable.3) The bezel is very large compared to some other Android based tablets.
4,Wanted a tablet for portability and ease of use but also needed Windows 10 for specialist astronomy software not available for Android (or IOS) devices.  This is the only tablet / small laptop I could find within budget that had Windows 10 so it fitted the bill.Works well and as intended but at expense of tablet functionality which is not as good as Android. This is down to Windows 10 and not the Fusion 5. However it works well enough in tablet mode when you get used to the quirks of Windows 10 and having a fully functioning laptop with USB / mini HDMI is very useful (I have added a 128MB micro SD card).  The SSD ensures it fires up quickly and works reasonably fast providing you don’t ask too much of the operating system by using several software applications at the same time.  The small physical size when using it as a PC with software programmes requires care and accuracy using the touch screen but is doable (I don’t have the keyboard but may upgrade). Not a problem for me as I use it mainly for web browsing and email and occasionally with a telescope when away from home.  Saves lugging a hefty high end laptop around.Yes the sound is poor but adequate and you can always use headphones or cast to another better sounding device.  Batterey life is reasonable although not as good as a tablet most likely due to the Windows 10 operating system (I guess around 5 hours). Time will tell how this mini PC / tablet fares particularly battery life but so far so good. Overall it does exactly what I wanted and I like it.
4,The Fusion5 Windows Tablet PC has exceeded my expectations. I have owned this device for a little over a month now.My Toshiba Encore Tablet gave up the ghost after four years of good service and I needed a quick replacement and the Fusion5 more than fits the bill.I experienced  a few niggles in the first few days as the camera app failed to work and the setting up of email  caused a few headaches. The ac power adapter packed up after a couple of charges so I now charge via USB. Not a big deal though.I'd had my eye on a Surface go and I thought I would rue my purchase of the Fusion5 after a patchy start.Things improved markedly once I replaced the Windows 10S by installing the full blown Windows. I don't  use third party apps games etc so the Store is adequate for me and is therefore not a security issue.Past reviewers have mentioned the poor sound from the speakers. That's true and not a patch on my old Toshiba. This is easily overcome with a Bluetooth speaker.The screen is very good however and the general build and specs are excellent for the price.I bought the docking keyboard and case a few days after purchase to complete the experience.When I realised the Surface is nearly four times more expensive than this little beauty I am happy I've made the right choice.
5,I looked at a lot of different tablets both android and windows and read so many reviews you wouldn't believe. This is a very well priced tablet for what it offers the other windows tablets I've seen at a similar price and spec have generally had poor or very poor reviews.  When first switched on you have to go through a few microsoft pages entering your details and preferences straightforward enough. I then updated windows there was very little to update justa few security bits took five minutes or so and then job done. It is a well made device which feels comfortable and solid not a flimsy vibe although I'm getting a case as I'm sure it wouldn't like to be dropped.the power and volume buttons at the top left hand of the screen feel solid although smal and thin and a little close together. to the side of these are the other inputs not to sure about the power supply socket as its a small round socket slightly smaller than a headphone socketit's not as solid as a usb socket and I can see myself catching the lead(the plug sticks out a fair wayan angled plug would be an improvment) and damaging the socket.  The sound quality is reasonable through headphones although slightly underpowered the speakers are quiet and I'm nearly maxing the volume watching a you tube video. I'm impressed with the screen quality good bright detailed colour and a pretty wide viewing angle videos and pictures look very nice! the screen is pretty responsive to touch and the onscreen keyboard works well.  The tablet picks up WiFi much better than my galaxy note and I'm really pleased with the speed and the ease of connection.I've looked at the microsoft app store and it's really poor compared to the android app's available I wouldn't suggest a windows tablet if your a big app user!  I decided on a windows tablet as I hope to load a few music production programs and I wanted some compatability between my sytems.I'll update this review with how I get on with that. multitrack software can be pretty demanding and I'm sure I'll have to compromise somewhere.  So far windows 10 has seemed really at home on this device and everything is working better than I really expected. Fusion have offered me a free gift (usb keyboard or sd card or a car charger) in return for a review on this item I quite fancy a usb keyboard but it's more important to me that I leave an honest review I rely heavily on reviews before buying anything from amazon and have no desire to mislead anyone..  Overall I'm really pleased with this item Thank you Fusion!
4,A replacement for 5 year old Windows Lynx7 (7" model) as I'm the wrong end of 60 I wanted to keep to an operating system I know.Insufficient operational memory (ram) is often to blame for hardware or software problems on PC's in general. So I think the 4gb ram 64gb storage model will pay dividends for Windows updates and smoother operation at a minimal extra cost.Out of the box the Fusion 5 is obviously larger than my old model however it feels lighter than I expected yet substantial and well constructed. The Windows 10 set up and updates are fairly straight forward to accomplish to an operational status.As shipped the Fusion5 included a screen protector so far I have been very impressed it seems fit for purpose and a good purchase without the extra cost associated with higher end Windows 10 tablets.The basic unit is fully expandable which means external devices are very well catered for.A full size USB and larger HDMI ports negates the need for flimsy cables or adapters that often feel vulnerable.With an additional SD card you can increase the application and file storage capacity by 128gb if you can't rely on Wi-Fi cloud based storage.Bluetooth headphones or speakers can greatly enhance the audio quality and so on.So far so good only time will tell if with proper use the internal build quality will live up to the excellent first impressions of this tablet.
4,I waited till I had used the tablet for a while before commenting. charges fast but loses power fast when watching films.Virtual keyboard is really touchy to the point that I have had to buy the 'only' keyboard dock that fits it - it keeps dissapearing back down when you are typing and you have to keep popping it back up from the taskbar to continue and even on some basic search engines won't work at all. . Very frustration. The dock/keyboard itself(Purchased separately) is ok if on a flat surface only - you cannot use it on your knee it does not sit.  You have to make sure when closing that the tablet is docked properly into the cover or you risk the tablet coming out the side.The tablet heats up pretty warm when running processes for a wee while. i.e. films or working with documents. Worth mentioning not to leave on a surface that could melt.There is no safety glass to fit it- I asked.Would I purchase again I would say no due to the frustration of the virtual keyboard.Is it worth the money again I would have to say no as I am now considering buying another type of tablet as this one's niggles outweigh the pros which are the speed of boot programs run well and haven't as yet frozen.
4,Does exactly what I was hoping It would.I was a little sceptical given some reviews but so far this has been a great purchase. Yes it’s not an iPad (I’ve got one of those) but neither is the price! It allows me to do what an iPad or Galaxy tab can’t and that’s work with a programme only available on PC’s.I was also concerned that this programme might struggle to work on the Fusion tab as it can be troublesome on a good PC but it installed with no issues at all.So all in all I am happy well packaged simple  to setup and works as hoped.Only downside is the screen is perhaps a little  dark but that could be down to the included screen protector.I’m just hoping now that it continues to perform as good as it has for its first month no reason to think it will not at this stage.For those who may be interested the programme I bought it to use with is Line6 Helix HX Edit (guitar effects modeller). Bonus is I can also use as a spare tablet PC.
2,I bought this tablet about 5 months ago as a small alternative to a laptop for travelling with. While it is conveniently sized for travel and is nice and light there are issues:- I assume due to the massive amount of pre-installed gumpf that it seems impossible to have a windows machine without it runs extremely slowly. Having to wait 5-10 seconds (minimum) for windows to open after clicking might not seem like too much of a problem but if you're used to even a reasonable-quality smartphone or desktop machine then this will quickly become extremely tedious.- The massive border around the screen is extremely irritating. Be aware that the actual screen size is more like 8" rather than 10" due to the large border on it that seems to serve no discernible purpose.- It often struggles to know when it should be bringing up a keyboard which is a pain.- As many useful Apps are not available on Windows (Amazon Prime video for example) it is difficult to use for travelling without an additional investment in a lot of mobile data for streaming purposes (since without these apps shows or movies cannot be pre-downloaded to watch later).- Does not come with Microsoft Office included.- Charger cable has a built-in plug so you will not be able to charge from power-banks or similar. Perhaps this is a necessity due to the power requirements but it is still extremely irritating.- The image quality on the screen is actually not bad and sound quality is fine. It's also fairly easy to connect bluetooth headphones to the device (assuming you can get over the loading times mentioned above) so from this point of view it's perfectly fine.- The attachable keyboard the can be bought separately is frankly dreadful. I'll leave a separate review for that but if you are considering purchasing this with a view to using as a laptop-equivalent with the addition of the keyboard I would strongly recommend looking for an alternative!- The OneDrive functionality from Windows works well on this and is extremely useful so a definite plus-point (although this is not exclusive to this tablet and relevant to any windows machine). It was also extremely straightforward to map my google drive to the device and access everything there although I would note that it often takes some time to refresh the files accessible.On balance this device is no more than adequate for the price and given that the price is at the very low-end of the tablet price-bracket I would probably recommend spending a bit more and getting a better dedicated tablet device or a small netbook/laptop device if that's what you're looking for. Be aware this isn't a magic fusion of the two - it combines some of the features of both but not hugely successfully and to be honest you're probably better off making a firm decision as to which you would prefer and going for that.
4,My 15-year old Dell PC tower finally gave up the ghost a few days ago and with it running XP was long overdue for replacement. I have an iPad but it doesn't have a USB port which I need to transfer to and from my phone and playback from memory sticks in the car and home stereos. I found Tablets with full-size USB ports pretty rare until I stumbled across the Fusion5 windows 10 10" tablet on Amazon. The low price point of £154 at first suggested that it couldn't be up to much but I was pleasantly surprised when itarrived just 2 days later. It seems to be of quality construction with 12 months guarantee (plus additional 90 days if registered within 14 days) and the screen is clearer than the 'retina' display on my iPad ! Very pleased with my purchase and upgrade to the latest Windows 10 OS so much so that I will be using it for more than just transfers to memory sticks - to this end I have already downloaded Libre Office (the free alternative to Microsoft) and Money Sunset Deluxe financial apps. A separate keyboard would be of great benefit though and is next on my list - the compact screen is a boon but also hinders typing. Overall very pleased - and the online chat support from Fusion5 is also very good !
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Bought this as a christmas present. Before I wrapped it I spent hours checking if it was okay.I'm suprised how quick it is to the touch. It is a little slow downloading apps at first probably because it's the first time booting up. But gets a little quicker.After trial and error I got the Bluetooth working perfectly. One thing that I really dont like is the sound. Even at 100% sound it's still quiet and I dont like how it sounds. But if u connect via Bluetooth a portable speaker or/and headphones it works better.(EDIT-Jan 7th 2019) its been weeks since using this tablet and im impressed how well it has managed. After spending time on this tablet theres only 3 downsides; When charging and downloading things at once it tends to heat up it can get hot but all you need is to let it cool down for a bit. secondly the sound but as i said before it can easily be better if you connect headphones or a speaker to it. Thirdly it can be slow sometimes when downloading and sometimes streaming (but that could be the whole household on wifi at the same time)One thing i will say though is the quality when watching movies via netflix amazon etc is that it is pretty amazing. I was expecting not a HD looking display when streaming because of the price and that i hadn't heard of fusion5 before but i've been blown away at the quality. I hate anything that is even the littlest of bad quality.All in all its a pretty good price for the tablet and would recommend to anyone looking for a budget tablet.First 5 pics ive attached are screenshots of a tv show. The next 6 pics are taken with a sony phone of the tablet and charger. The video is of the sound quality WITHOUT a speaker making it sound better. I would add another (taken via iphone7)  vid but it will only allow 1 video per review.
4,Overall product was ok apart from screen freezing and keyboard not working properly hence the 4 stars and why I returned the product.
4,It's light fast enough and has a good selection of ports. I bought it to use at work and loaded MS office on it for that.
3,Bought two of these in June for our workplace.  They are used during working hours with our customer management software to serve customers.One has already started randomly switching off and staying off for a lengthy period of time despite being fully charged which is disturbing to customer flow.Contacted Fusion who offered to repair but declined providing a temporary replacement whilst repair carried out which is very inconvenient. Disappointing if you only had tab for 3 months.My advice is to avoid this product if you have the funds to go with a more reliable a product for peace of mind.
5,I got this for my dad as I figured at 85 he’d never be able to learn a new operating system of android or apple. Windows really isn’t suited to a small touch screen they are much better with an operating system designed for them (android or apple). Windows 10 has got a tablet mode but for his intended use it makes no difference. Even though everything is obviously small on this screen he is getting on very well with it he just uses a touch stylus . He is finding it hard to type anything on the touch screen though as the keyboard takes up half the screen then you can’t see the other important things on the screen sometimes not even what you’re trying to type! So I’ll get him the optional keyboard it effectively becomes a small laptop then.Overall he is very pleased with it I got him going with OneDrive file sharing so he can easily swap between working on the proper laptop & this. He bought Microsoft office a good few years ago for his laptop & we were pleased to find the same product key worked on this too (Office 2010 but it seems newer versions would work too not older than 2010 though). So he can easily edit & save his Word documents down on the OneDrive & re-open them up on either his lap or this now.The only minor issue I can see is the charging connection it’s the same type as fitted to some cheap tablets I got my kids & they broke them very quickly being too rough with the connection. I told him to be careful with it so it should be ok hopefully!
5,Well I bit the bullet and ordered the 4g RAM version of this tablet and so far have been very impressed. I don't normally review stuff but on this occasion felt compelled to do one.I wasnt expecting much but tried this for taking to work  I'm in a broadcast engineering environment and fed up lugging a laptop about. My tablet arrived yesterday and I spent today setting it up and loading software on I use for work mainly Rohde & Schwaz test equipment.  Its run power view and its associated software flawlessly with a USB RF power head within problems. I also run up some ASI USB analysers and it run just as good as it does on my i5 laptop!Its early days yet but I am more than impressed with this tablet a great screen fast startup and so far a 5 hour battery with intensive usage.Speakers are the only nag but I'll use a bluetooth speaker if required so only a small niggle as far as I'm concerned.Its nogaming machine but it more than adequate for MS Office YouTube Netflix etc but I'm running real time RF analyser equipment on this tablet with no issues its flawlessly coping with all I  chuck at it.Well done Fusion5! You by far exceeded my expectations in a product that is fantastic 'bang for buck'  3 engineers I work with are already ordering theirs.  I'll upload a video of it in action soon!
4,I did thorough research before purchasing this Fusion 5 tablet and it scored high on my requirements list.  I have been using it for a couple of weeks now and it has become a great travelling companion.  It has higher specifications than many similar products.  The expandable  64gb storage and 4mb of RAM make a big difference to other lower spec tablets that I have had.  I also bought the docking keyboard which enables it to be used as a very compact laptop.  The Bluetooth capability is great as I have connected a Bluetooth mouse freeing up the USB port.  I use mine while travelling and the battery life is very good.  This tablet represents great value for money and I have found the team at Fusion 5 very helpful and quick to solve an issue that I had experienced.  So to summarise:-* Great Value* Very good specifications and features.* Very good after sales service.Patrick Flynn
4,I replaced my Linx10 with this Fusion5 in April as the battery performance was beginning to fail after 5 years of use I was so impressed with the Fusion5 that I have now purchased one for my husband too.  It’s a great tablet for the money.  He uses it mostly for Microsoft Classic games and it serves the purpose well and it has double the storage capacity of his Linx10.  It was simple enough to set up although it does take a while for all the windows updates to come through.  Charging is a breeze in comparison to the Linx10.  The touchscreen is very responsive which is a huge advantage when playing games.  Delivery was super fast.  All in all we are both very happy with our purchase.  For the price it is excellent.
4,I purchased this Fusion5 Windows tablet because I wanted something small enough to pack in hand luggage on trips away from home but enable me to monitor/maintain emails have online access to the internet use Skype and view my Word/Excel documents. I wanted at least 64GB storage (my previous tablet had only 32GB which I found too restrictive) and a full size USB port. I use Thunderbird for emails and synchronize the Profile as necessary between the Fusion5 and my desktop using FreeFileSync. For security when away I keep my documents on a memory stick but can view these on Fusion5 via the USB port. I have linked a UK keyboard and a mouse via Bluetooth which for me enhance the tablet's usability when sitting at a desk. I find the mouse a lot easier than using the touchpad. The keyboard works but I find it too small to touch type. I've only had my Fusion5 for a short while but so far I'm pleased with the way it performs.
4,Using this tablet for MS Win programs which do not require a lot of resources(RAM CPU etc.). When exited Windows S mode it is running Windows10 Home. Good value for money.
3,For its price this isn't a bad tablet however there are a number of big flaws in its design.Firstly the sound is dreadful even with it on full you can just about watch Netflix lying next to it in bed in a quiet room (my budget Asus tablet outperforms this by a long way as will any decent smartphone).Second issue is the finish I might have got a bad one but there were a number of small bubbles under the screen (outside of the display area luckily) and with a plastic finish it doesn't feel strong.It also has dreadful WiFi sitting next to the router I can pick up around 30mb/s whereas my Pixel 2 connected to the same WiFi network gets more than double this speed.Final bugbear is the Port layout full size USB is brilliant but it's at the top of the tablet meaning that using it in laptop configuration you have a load of cables hanging out of the top of it the ports are also really close together meaning that I actually hand to file down the HDMI to mini-HDMI adapter to actually get it to fit alongside a USB cable if using both at the same time.These points aside for Netflix Word Excel Chrome PowerPoint and general tasks generally better suited to Windows over IoS on Android this is a bargain price and I can see me using it a lot despite some disappointing issues.
5,I been round in circles between Android iOS and Windows. For productivity I really wanted Windows but also wasn't sure how well it worked as a tablet OS. I'm not keen on Android except for browsing games etc. I do like iOS and its the best tablet OS in my opinion but again not a full OS. The surface range is expensive and I didn't want to make an expensive mistake. I thought if this doesn't work out I won't kick myself too hard. However despite its low spec its fast enough and the lower resolution screen is actually just about right for the size. The touch screen works well and with a proper USB port I could just plug a mouse in which together with a pretty good on-screen keyboard is quite productive without turning it into a laptop which I didn't want to do. I was after a tablet not a laptop which I already have. The first thing I did was bomb out of S mode so I could install some proper software. Everything I've put on works well and at this point I'm impressed with my purchase.
5,I bought this tablet to replace my 5 year old Asus VivoTab which I use whilst travelling. The old machine could not support the latest version of Windows 10 and was noticeable slow attempting to support Office 365 desktop applications. This brilliant bit of kit is not only 64bit but also includes the very latest build of Windows (1803) so includes "Files-on-Demand" which gives me access to over 1Tb of files via my Office 365 account. All the applications run smoothly and super fast. The tablet's build looks very professional with a nice texture on the back which helps you grip the device.If like me you use the Microsoft Teams app you will need a keyboard as the on-screen keyboard hides the chat entry field. Having checked with the seller I now have the matching Fusion5 case with keyboard which I am pleased to say has a UK layout and build-in tracker pad. A slight down side is the lack of instructions although as an IT professional of over 40 years I have quick become accustom to the enhanced functionally of the tracker pad.The tablet does get quite warm whilst charging and when performing CPU intensive processes but still OK to handle. This may have a negative impact on the battery life which is currently exceptional... over 10 hours of average use between charges. Only time will tell if the battery can't deal with the heat.If you need a small portable Windows laptop or tablet then you sure certainly consider this device as its performance vs cost is outstanding.
1,Taught by hindsight I'd avoid this product and company - the 4GB memory 64GB storage tablet+keyboard is around £200 - for the similar price there are better alternatives.The tablet is not too bad. Performance is OK what you'd expect from 4GB of RAM and Windows10 (can't imagine the 2GB memory version). The screen resolution is average touchscreen works OK.Customer service is OK - fast replies polite but that's just the facade. The software keyboard and support are the things to avoid.The keyboard is VERY clunky keys are hard typing is awkward. Special function keys ('Fn' key + F1 to F12 keys e.g. volume up/down brightness up/down etc.) do not match what's on the keys some are not there at all - support told me it's because of a different language on the tablet but special function keys are hardware based and shouldn't be affected. The keyboard totally stopped working after 4 month anyway.The tablet started to have power-on issues after 6 months - sometimes wouldn't turn on you had to press the power key and hoped for the best - longest it took me to power it on one time was 3 hours.Drivers are very basic and not available anywhere else but from the manufacturer. You can't configure the touchpad and you can't set it to turn off when you're using a Bluetooth or USB mouse like on a laptop - I kept hitting the touchpad when typing very annoying and distracting. If you need to reinstall a device (touchpad camera etc.) or have any problems you have to sent it back (for me it was around £15 by Royal Mail non-refundable).I sent the tablet back on warranty got it back with a new keyboard and totally scratched screen! Photos are right from when I received the item back and after cleaning the screen - it was filthy with bubbles underneath as if dropped and really bad scratches. Totally not how I sent it to support!Luckily Amazon helped with the refund as it would have been too long to get a refund from Fusion5.Do yourself a favour and google other "windows 10 tablets" for a similar price or even go for a refurbished/used higher-end model. There are better alternatives for a similar price this one is not worth the hassle if you have other options.
4,I bought this tablet to enable me to use my PC (which is kept in my home office) less. I experienced a couple of set-up problems: Email refresh needs modifying in order for all existing emails to be accessible and initial downloads takes while. MS' App Store isn't as comprehensive as (da are I mention it) Apple's. The touch keyboard is also a little imprecise too. Apart from these issues- of which only keyboardresponse(see?) is a lasting issue the tablet meets all of my needs).  The screen is wider than an iPad Air and resolution excellent. I downloaded MSOffice asI have multiple  license and off we go! I wish there were more and better cases available but look forward to seeing what the keyboard dockingcase is like. All in all a great buy if you want MS Windows on a tablet; way cheaper than a Surface Pro.
4,For a similar setup with the mainstrean OS provider you are looking at over £400 so it is good value for money for a mobile full windows 10 tablet. I have only used it a handful of times so I am impressed with the screen quality and that I am able to run any conventional aps on it either as a touch screen or with a wireless keyboard as a smaller screen desktop PC. With an additional sd card there is enough room for my needs. The only down sides I have found so far is battery life is not the best if not used for a week or two it seems to drain a full charge whilst shutdown and when it runs out of power it seems to reset / blank any bios startup password.  For a regular user I would say that overall it is good value for money.
4,I bought this for Xbox one game streaming (playing remotely from the Xbox one) so I could play the Xbox while the tv in front room being used. I had a few challenges. Firstly the built-in Wi-Fi is not 802.11ac so is too slow. After some research I decided it cheaper to get a usb 3.0 Wi-Fi adapter for £10 than replace this with a upgraded tablet. Fortunately the tablet has a usb 3 port. Next challenge was Wi-Fi range I bought some excellent tp-link powerline adapters with built in Wi-Fi which gave my 5Ghz Wi-Fi a much needed range boost. Also the tablet already has a micro hdmi port so I bought a micro to normal cable which means I can effectively attach to any tv. Now it works great - I Bluetooth connect my Xbox controller to the tablet and can play as if I was in the front room either on tablet (screen a bit small) or on another tv.
5,Update still going strong as off Nov 2021 !!Have been using a Linx10 (all good too) but I needed more memory and a faster chip so went for this Fusion5 model (4gram/64g) plus up to a 125 gig SD - Wow ! All seems to be working after the usual interuptions from Windows updates. Its amazing as I can now use my fave Music DAWs (Acid8) in 64 bit. As per Windows it take the usual time to switch off all the excesses. The touch screen is very responsive and comes with its own protector. The PSU is a bit fiddly and not sure if UK legal as the sliding plastic earth is wobbly and makes it loose in a power socket. This I feel needs an upgrade as everyone elses is much better.Such as small device for music production I might even start hanging around coffee shops to save on my heating.Have a slight issue with the keyboard add on as the contacts seem a bit glitchy but have contacted Fusion for advice or return. Its a shame that the USB3 socket is not apparently working in USB2 mode as my DVD/Data player is not working so will have to upgrade as need it to fill up with software. Hopefully it should be ok for my mic preamp.The little speakers are in the right place but I will be using a bluetooth speaker for extra power.
4,For the money it is hard to see any competition.  It comes with windows 10s installed which might be ok for most but it's lack of support for installing the chrome browser (not included in the windows app store) was an issue for us as we use google apps and classroom a lot.  We have also found chrome more responsive that the built in edge browser which claims to be the fastest.  However it was a quick and easy process to turn windows 10s into the normal full windows 10 and with that we can install what we want including open office etc.  The screen is clear and the touch response is good sound is adequate for a tablet but nothing special.
4,Item arrived promptly and well packaged.  I purchased this item with the keyboard docking station which arrived one day after the  Tablet.  I think this is an essential addition as personally I did not get on very well with the 'screen keyboard'.  I also purchased a radio mouse as again personally I am not overly happy using a tracker pad.  Set up of the tablet was easy and WiFi and Blue-Tooth work well.  Setting up my Office 365 account to access my office apps was easy too.  For the price this is an excellent good purchase - I have had and used it continually for a month with no problems so far.  Four stars because I didn't find the screen keyboard particularly responsive but overall this tablet does the job well.  Seller responded very quickly when I requested a VAT receipt.
5,After being sceptical that such a cheap tablet would be that useful I have found this to not be the case at all. The tablet whilst not as fast as my laptop can undertake any of the MS office tasks and web browsing is easy.The build quality is pretty good and light but not that durable so a case is a must. The screen cover I bought only cover the touch area. But I must add this isn't from the same supplier.The case keyboard works well although initially I thought it had a fault as it just wouldn’t work. Later I found that it does but perhaps there's a small software glitch. Seems to be fine now although I tend to just use the main touch screen keyboard.In the purchase is an extended warrantee which doesn’t show upon registration. But a few emails to and throw from the helpful staff assured me it has been applied.Charging is relatively quick and battery last well. I'm not too keen on the tiny round charge plug/socket as it looks weak and they are not as commons as other types. Personally I would much prefer to see a USB C as most products are going over to this connection.
3,Work very well offline.  Struggled to get a suitable protective case but managed to alter one to fit.  Seems to work slow when connected online perhaps due to windows updates.  But I purchased it to work offline so does not impact it's functionality.
5,I like the portable powerful nature of this tablet. Ideal for work and for streaming video.I would recommend for the price point.
3,volume of speaker is way to low. no good for watching videos
5,I bought this to code on the plane. I can run visual studio and Android studio (and visual code) on it. Slower than a normal laptop but ok. (2x  slower o Android studio on a compilation using Gradle etc). Battery is good - not uncommon to see 10 hours (usual problem of trying to avoid it staying on after you think you have switched it off). It has a micro USB which can charge from a USB charger (needs to be about 2.4A) - and of course you have the (non standard) mains adapter (I would have dropped that and made sure you could charge from the micro USB from the mains). windows home and no tpm so no bitlocker. You can plug it into an 1920x1280 display (I have not tried more). Says it takes tf cards: those are just micro sds you just need to take the leap of faith to push it into the slot. The "not 11.6" laptop keyboard works with this. The connection is not great and it increases the overall width but it is a good investment. I run o365 on it so I have the full office package. Get the 64Gb version (or highest Gb) as today's apps for eat a lot of space. This laptop has been amazing.
5,I bought this product to be used specifically at athletics meetings. New international and national rules that come into force in November 2020 mean that technology needs to play a more prominent role in this sport. I am waiting for a camera to arrive that will be connected to the tablet and used to record video of long jump and triple jump attempts. We have software that will allow us to save attempts where an athlete has a foul. This will help a great deal. The machine will also be used by the Officials who marshall all the athletes as they arrive at a race site allowing instant communication between several sets of people which will enable a far more professional and smooth running of all track races. The long battery life is a bonus and even better we can provide a power bank to top up the charge in between events. I know a lot of people are looking forwards to seeing this in action once our sport is allowed to restart. Thanks Fusion good machine great value great price
4,Just bought this tablet to replace an Asus Vivotab. I had a few  problems trying to decide whether this was the right tablet to buy - attempted to find a complete spec of the device and what ports it had was impossible. I wanted an HDMI port like the ASUS but the info available on the Fusion site was minimal. Eventually found a photo that showed the portI also gave up trying to buy the tablet directly from Fusion as the payment systems seemed flaky.Having received the product all looks good- my only small gripe is there is no indication light for charging which the ASUS had.  (This is useful to show if the device is connected and fully charged).Early days  but hopefully its as good as others say.
1,I've been in IT for 35 years so I feel I have a reasonable amount of experience at least enough to comment constructively on this item.  I bought this to run Zwift as I have a turbo trainer for my cycle that I use indoors.  The idea was to mount it on the handlebars so that I could easily view Zwift whilst training.Simple enough idea but in practice this tablet can barely run Windows 10 let alone additional applications.  The spec sounds decent enough in fact it should easily have coped with Zwift but the unfortunate reality says otherwise.  It took a long time to set up and install necessary updates I began to get a bad feeling when it took two hours to install Zwift....On running Zwift the graphics could not cope even at low resolution and the device couldn't keep up making the application totally unusable due to the amount of on-screen lag.Also the sound is absolutely pathetic my iPhone is MUCH better... and it runs Zwift perfectly albeit on a lot smaller display which is why I wanted this tablet.So back it goes.... and goodbye to about 5 hours of my life.  It really was too good to be true.
5,This is the second Fusion 5 tablet I have ordered for my husband who knows nothing about computers but enjoys doing puzzles. He finds it perfect.  I also have the same model and I know a reasonable amount about computers . I find it perfect. I also use it with a keyboard and can take it anywhere with me .It is my second one due to a mess-up with updates from Windows which rendered my first Fusion tablet useless and I had to get a replacement. Fusion are a very good company who give help and advice when needed . I sat on my first Tablet accidentally and cracked the screen. I sent it back for repair to Fusion as I could not get it done anywhere else and they repaired it very reasonably priced paid also for the postage and returned it within 10 days.  I would definitely recommend this Tablet and the company.
5,<y first impression was how good the build quality of this relatively cheap tablet is. It's not metal; it's plastic but it feels strong stiff and well put together.Apart from that it is a proper computer with Windows 10. It thus has the flexibility in use of any other Windows-based computer but lacks the huge variety of standard apps you get with an Android device.The screen looks good bright and with good resolution. I find however that it lacks sensitivity using the touch screen: you sometimes have to press quite hard. With my fat fingers this can be a significant problem acting on the smaller icons. It works better for me to use a mouse or similar pointing device.The full-size USB socket means a mouse and similar peripherals are easily connected.The speaker on my tablet is very poor quiet and distorted. Other reviewers do not seem to have found similar though so perhaps I just have a faulty example.I have the newer 64GB storage model. Together with the 128GB SD storage card I have installed this supplies very adequate storage for my needs. Once the storage taken by the operating system is taken into account though I doubt there will be enough left to be really useful. I certainly recommend paying the little more for the bigger version.
3,This tablet is fine for the price paid with one exception. It is the slowest charging piece of tech I have ever come across. I just spent 24 hours to get it up to 50%. Overnight charging is a must if you want to get any use out of it the next day. Sadly many time I have forgotten to do this and have been unable to use it when I need to.The rest is ok - it's just the charging.
5,It quite surprised me with the Windows 10 running into a tablet with quite average speed.The screen is quite good touch sensible with great responsiveness.Support team was great with all enquiries about the product and quick reply.If you want a tablet to run Win10 if light software's  and into your budget that is your tablet.:D
4,A really solid entry level machine.  Great for running office apps browsing the internet etc.  I strongly reccomend buying the keyboard from the Fusion 5 website if you want to use if for work.  A a further note the customer service on the website seems really good with online chat support available.  I would definately buy this again as a basic work machine.  My only complaint is that it would have been nice to have the option of getting the keyboard at the same time from Amazon but this is a very minor niggle.
4,Have now had the Fusion5 for 1 week and am well pleased  if you are used to windows 10 you will have no problem with the tablet. It is easy to use and the manual although basic is more than enough for any one not used to a windows operating system. I would have liked a new case but the fusion store has none available  tried amazon but again no luck so have made some changes to an old tablet case so have saved some money . The camera front and rear are excellent so is the video .
4,This is a great bit of kit for the money. Works very well o ly downside to this machine that I can find is the poor sound that comes out the speakers on the tablet. This is easily fixed by using headphones either wired as there is a headphone jack or wireless connected through the tablets Bluetooth. Use this main for streaming netflix prime which has to be done through the Internet as Windows store doesn't have prime video or the kindle app. Nothing to do with the tablet this is a issue for windows. Screen quality very good and the bonus of have ports on the side USB 3.0 hdmi and also a micro sd card to expand the memory or download file right onto the tablet. Would highly recommend.
5,I bought this to replace my son's Kindle for Kids.  At home he is used to Windows PC gaming and since the tablet-only gaming experience can often seem rather frustrating by comparison (which sadly tends to have an effect on the enjoyment of things like holidays days out etc.) I looked for something closer to a PC than a tablet.  The FWIN232+ seems to be a perfect compromise.  I also got the ingenious folding case/keyboard and added a wireless mouse via the USB port (for gaming a trackpad is less fun than a mouse) and now it really is just like taking a PC on holiday.  And for those times when you just want a tablet or to take a photograph it can of course do all that too.  It has also replaced my wife's old MacBook as the laptop we leave lying around the house for browsing shopping etc.  Best of all because my son can now play Half-Life and Minecraft anywhere he no longer complains when we have to go out somewhere.  In that sense it has already payed for itself :-)  This is definitely one of the best things I've bought in a long time.
5,really like the simplicity of the technology. product came on time and we’ll packaged. would recommend.
4,Bought this pc a week or two ago and have been struggling with it it's been too slow too flaky for all the time I had it *until I did a full software reset* which reinstalled windows. There must be something badly wrong with the software release that comes preinstalled as it now runs fine. I just wish it hadn't taken me a week or two of farting around with it to figure that out. It'll very-much a windows pc in tablet form and runs anything a full laptop/desktop can. I wouldn't try anything to intensive gaming wise but I think it would be fine with minecraft or games of that ilk.
5,Unlike many windows tablets in this price range this one has 64GB of storage and not the more common 32G. This means windows updates actually work and it's not laggy or stuttery when watching videos.  The 10" screen size and resolution are perfect for browsing the web most comparable windows tablets seem to have 8" or even 7" screens which are just not big enough. I can't comment on the battery life as I regularly plug the tablet in and don't tend to use it for long periods. The charger unlike most tablets these days is a barrel jack rather than USB and doesn't have a very positive feel when you plug it in. That said I have had no problems with it. The sound quality is what you'd expect for a tablet or laptop  of this size - not hi-fi quality and a little bit tinny - but not too tinny and only OK volume level. Overall it's not too shabby for the price.
4,I bought this because I wanted to be able to travel lighter and so far this product has enabled me to do just that.  It's very easy to use and the screen quality is excellent.  I specifically bought the 4gb/64gb version of this because I suspected the 2gb/32gb version would be insufficient for my needs.The only things I don't like about this product are the sound quality which isn't great although bearing in mind the size of the item it also isn't that bad and the fact that I had to buy a stylus because the screen responsiveness isn't always the best which is particularly noticeable when trying to double click files.But overall. for the price I'm happy with my purchase.
4,I wanted a product that would allow me to have the best of both worlds - a tablet when I want to browse and a more traditional "computer" that would allow me to use a mouse and windows applications.  This does both without costing the earth.  I find this the perfect size and has all the output (HDMI and USB3 ports I will need).  i do suggest getting a 128gb micro SD card as additional storage.  The images on the screen look sharp.I took off one star as the sound quality on the speaker is quite poor - you will headphones when using it to watch films or listen to music.
5,Well I wasn't expecting quite so much from this little device but I am pleasantly surprised. It's a Windows 10 PC and unlike other tablets has SD HDMI full size USB mini USB (with an adapter to full size) as well as Bluetooth and WiFi. The supplied power adapter is small enough to carry with you and the pad will charge from USB but much slower. Although I haven't timed the battery life it seems more than enough for general use. Being Windows there's a lot of software out there and running Libre office is easy.Build quality is better than expected as is the screen and its responsiveness is as good as any. A bonus - it comes with a screen protector pre installed!The Atom processor and graphics are fine (don't expect to run Titanfall but this is cheaper than most graphics cards cost!) and HD videos don't make it break a sweat! I am more pleased with my purchase than I would have imagined.So far so good. Have seen some reviews for the 2/32 version saying they can't upgrade Windows - run disk clean to clear the old Windows upgrade cache as it clears a lot of junk.
4,I was looking for a tablet that could run Windows 10 for applications that can not be run on a Android tablet and to be honest having been in IT for a long time was expecting to have to purchase a expensive machine knowing how CPU power hungry Win 10 can be.Having read many reviews decided to give it a go and what a very pleasant surprise it was the screen is crisp and clear battery life is more than acceptable for a Windows tablet  WIFI is fast and reliable slightly disappointed with the built in speakers but with headphones plugged in the sound is stunning.Still exploring but so far a happy punter.
4,Although I haven't had this product for that long I am impressed with its speed and responsiveness. I would say I am a bit of a novice at speeds and what's inside a computer but this little tablet seems good. It has a nice feel to it and seems well built (unlike some plastic type ones). Good storage space and screen although isn't cinema quality does the job for something this size. Downside if I had to pick one is it's temperature was watching Netflix on it and became quite hot although upon questioning this the seller they have assured this is normal. Overall nice item for the price.
3,Decent Quality - This passed the test of my 10 year old played who many games with no issue including Minecraft and Roblox. As he used it and didn't abused the thing lasted well over a year. Finally the screen cracked and he persuaded me to buy him a gaming pc. He had earned it!Lacks resolution - Screen res is lower than a lot of competitors but the cpu is decent and the price is fair. Had to keep on power for its end life as the battery was not calibrated during its constant use.
5,If like I was you're looking for something to do the normal day to day things like surfing the web watching movies YouTube word processing reading etc then this is perfect. Ok its not super fast it doesn't have loads of RAM or disk space etc so you're unlikely to be able to use it effectively for high end things like high resolution video editing CAD etc but for everything else I'd say it's going to be absolutely fine (I've even done things like writing and testing software on it with no issues).Value for money wise I think you'd struggle to find anything better especially considering its a fully functional version of Windows 10 the connectivity its got battery life etc.One thing to be aware of that had me worried initially is that straight out of the box mine was slow turns out though that this was just Windows doing a big update in the background and once this was finished the speed was fine.Would definitely recommend.
4,Great tablet for the price bought to replace a previous Fusion 5 that was accidentally broken by my son. The two things I really appreciate are that it is Windows-based so totally compatible with my PC - if I have a programme that works on the PC it works on here - and also that it has a USB port for the times when I want one (like for an external drive for back-up or a disk drive). I also bought the matching keyboard which helps if doing much input or playing games as it gets rid of the on-screen keyboard
4,This tablet and the compatible keyboard were purchased on behalf of a friend who is a relative newcomer to this form of technology. There were a few teething problems which took time to resolve.Initially the tablet would not perform when connected to the docking keyboard.  Mike from the seller was helpful with aftersales advice and tips to resolve the matter.Now the unit is functioning as it should and all seems well.  The sound could be better but that's a a minor quibble.Some additional literature about the correct method of combining the two elements together would have saved time.  All in all a nice piece of kit.
3,Battery could be best  screen ok
4,The does everything I can do on my Windows desktop so far but is light and easily portable. With the keyboard it becomes a mini-laptop though you can only use it on a desk not your lap in this form. I had to do more research than I would have liked to find out how to use the trackpad but I am an old fossil who still uses a mouse. The screen is clear and bright. I have only had it two weeks but so far am very pleased. It would be a five-star review if there were more instructions or even a link to a downloadable manual.
4,I bought it to replace a linx 10 that had given up the ghost and I'm impressed. I find it ideal for browsing the web reading and looking at pictures. It starts quickly has very good wireless conectivity impressive graphics and screen resolution can be charged with a micro USB cable has a full sized USB port a slot for an HD card to expand its memory and bluetooth conectivity. The only thing that disappoints is the surprisingly tinny sound from the built in speakers but the bluetooth allows it to connect to better speakers easily.
4,I bought this tablet as I’m setting up a business and it will come in good use. It’s a nice swish little tablet. It’s well made and doesn’t look cheap. Setup was easy - just follow online instructions. Everything appears to be syncing with my windows laptop too which has made my life a lot easier. The battery life is pretty good - only used 20% and had it on downloading updates and other stuff for last two hours. It’s a decent size - ideal for having on your lap and taking away to meetings. Works just like my laptop accept in a tablet. Great graphics. Very pleased!!
5,I was asked to write an impartial view about this product. I haven't had it for very long so haven't used it much yet.  The reason I chose this particular product over an iPad or Kindle was that I get headaches from using Wi-Fi so was wanting a device that can connect to the router via an ethernet cable. I bought a micro USB to ethernet adapter from plugable.com it was about £11 and it has allowed me to connect to the router without using Wi-Fi. After I had gone into settings and turned off Bluetooth and Wi-Fi I tested the device with an electrosmog detector and the reading was very low. As far as I know the adapter will not work with the iPad and Kindle and  works well with devices that use Windows 8.1 or 10. It worked straight away so I'm  very happy because I'm not exposing myself to so much radiation.
4,This is a great FUSION windows tablet PC which is light ideal for day to day activities.The tablet boots fast and has a speedy internet connection and browsing. The external sd card slot is so ideal that it allows you to save your activities on the SD card instead of the internal memory.Great quad core CPU and 4gb ram make any job easy.I would by another one soon for my friend's birthday.Please FUSION continue the excellent work on all your tablets and I am sure your customers base will increase dramatically.Highly recommended tablet as it takes any worries or doubts away.Cheers
4,Needed a good quality but inexpensive Windows 10 tablet for a work project and this fitted the bill very well. It starts up and runs quickly with the 4Gb RAM and connectivity is excellent. Only slight downside is the screen quality but that's not really surprising at this price point. Delivery and communication was also very good.
5,Overall I am very happy with this tablet which I purchased at the end of June. This is my first tablet and I wanted the same operating system as my laptop so chose a windows 10 one. In my ignorance I didn't realise that android phone apps can't just be downloaded and used so that was a surprise for me (maybe there is a way round this but I haven't found it yet).I only have 2 minor criticisms - when the tablet is on 20% it then takes about 5 hours to recharge which seems a long time to me. And in the recent very hot weather this tablet seemed to get quite hot hotter then I would like so I took it out of the case and it was then fine.I think for the price it is good value for money and I am very glad I bought it. Thank you fusion.
4,I bought the Fusion tablet to access and use educational software that my granddaughter’s school recommended. The educational apps required a touch screen and I didn’t have this facility on my old laptop PC.It has been a great success.  I’m very pleased with the product and it came at a reasonable price. And more importantly my granddaughter is very happy!I would consider buying fusion products again.
4,I'm new to tablets so I have to admit to being lead by the reviews in which one to buy. Have to say I haven't been disappointed at all. I wanted the tablet for looking at e-mails web browsing watching movies and playing music. This device is capable of doing all of these with ease. Being a windows tablet I also have the advantage of being able to use all my favourite apps. Excellent
3,Nothing wrong with the tablet per se but I think I expected it to be faster and be able to run games that I play on my mobile such as merge dragons because it has Windows operating system. A great little tablet for casual use not as powerful as a laptop though
5,Just wow!I must say I was very dubious about purchasing this at first due to not being familiar with the brand and also the fact that it was cheaper than i would expect for this kind of productI have a chromebook which I use for my day to day use but I have some software that appears to only work with windows so needed something lightweight and portable but with a copy of windows on. I could not justify paying the price for a Surface TabletAfter finding this and convincing myself to give it a go I am more than impressed!i get a nice smooth user experice. No lag so far. Runs the software that I require and it is a perfect little device to carry around with me.I can also get it connected to the TV and use a bluetooth keyboard and mouse for when i do need a bigger screenAll in all this tablet is just awesome for the price.
5,I purchased a Fusion5 Windows Tablet a year ago and I am very happy with it so when my wife wanted a tablet I immediately purchased a second Fusion5 tablet. Delivery was very fast and efficient.I like the fact it is Windows 10 based (so much easier to use than Android I find) and easy to set-up and use. The optional keyboard is also very useful and works well.Fusion5 Customer Support is also fast and efficient.Highly Recommended.
4,Touchscreen not very responsive I have reduced feeling in finger tips and am often having to hit the screen quite  hard to get response not had this problem before. Nice tablet otherwise... Maybe it was just a fault but need it housebound so couldn't send it back as would be without till replaced. I manage but it is frustrating.
4,I bought this tablet as a long term replacement for my ipad.  The value for money is excellent and the screen quality is exceptional.  The sound is low and tinny but I mostly use mine with headphones so this isn't much of an issue for me.  Customer service was excellent when I bought the 64Gb model and was only sent the 32Gb version.  I was offered a replacement or a refund for the difference so I took the refund.
5,Firstly the tablet arrived within two days of ordering. Even though you can only install web apps from the Microsoft store this hasn't been a problem at all for me as it is only for home use. The screen quality is very good and the system is very responsive (a massive improvement on the Android tablet that it is replacing). Windows has already updated to the latest version of Windows 10 version 2004.I have now been using it for a week. Overall I am delighted with the Fusion 5 tablet and think it is very good value and would happily recommend it to anyone else thing of buying it.
4,I was majorly disappointed with this tablet :( might've just been the software or operating system but the tablet lagged in performance at times and the screen didn't always respond to the touch. Another thing I noticed was it's advertised as the processor being 1.90ghz however on going into the task manager it was doing 1.40ghz and that was at 100% usage! Ended up having to return it.
1,El wifi va muy mal el enchufe de carga es muy débil y con frecuencia se ralentiza el sistema. En mi opinión aquí lo barato me ha salido caro (he tenido que comprar otro de otra marca)
4,Very happy with the fusion 5 at present and after a few tries I soon got the hang of operating it. It is like a mini computer and does everything my laptop does but is more portable. I am happy to give it a 4 * review and only the battery life lets it down a little. Fusion have been quick to respond with the warranty etc and appear to be quite willing to be helpful. I can recommend this product. Sandra Vizer
4,I like the portability - not too large or heavy. Went around the world with me on airlines; 9 flights in 12 days! Slipped easily into hand baggage I found it easy to download lots of video for long flights. Great with headphones for watching downloaded video without disturbing  other passengers.
5,The Fusion 5 ultra slim tablet is absolutely ideal for my daughter's needs. It was purchased as an upgrade from a kids Amazon Fire Kindle and it is perfect for watching video's playing games or internet browsing.Also it is brilliant for when your on the go and you can continue your work or Netflix video at any time or place. The memory is great and you also have the option of adding an additional memory card to increase this. We bought a leather protective case and it safe guards the tablet against any possible damage. Also we have added the option of using a wireless keyboard and mouse so it can also be used as a desktop PC. For the cost of this tablet it certainly has been a great purchase so far.
4,This is an OK tablet. I have nothing against it except the operative system Windows10S. I was going to send it back when I found that I was unable to download any apps unless they are from Microsoft store.It was good I search on youtube about Windows10S. There is a way to upgrade to Windows Home.
5,I have had this tablet for just over a week now and cannot fault it to be honest.. For the price I was a bit doubtful it would delivery but it has really exceeded my expectations.. This item was bought to be used as a touch screen interface to a specific product running bespoke software we develop which does not need a high spec PC and so not using it as a day to day tablet but this device fitted the requirement exactly..The screen is good quality we do not need to run on the battery much as can run on mains but I have been running it for many hours without it being plugged in to test and the power management seems to hold the battery life very well. Packaging was all good and the build quality also very good.. in fact so far absolutely no complaints and a great product.
5,My FUSION5 tablet arrived quickly well packaged well protected. Setting up was easy but I recommend allowing the windows updates to download. The device has 64 GB internal storage which can be of course  extended with a using an additional microSD card. I found the touch screen to be very responsive and screen resolution is more than perfect for a tablet of this size. This was ideal to be used for part of a DIY SLS camera setup for Ghost Hunting/Paranormal Investigation. Compared to other tablets the Fusion 5 offers great value for money for all the features it has to offer I am very pleased with it and would not hesitate to recommend to others.
5,Bought this primarily for university to take notes etc and it has been absolutely brilliant so far (had it for almost 2 months). Battery life is very good easily lasting 2 days of web surfing and word processing on a full charge. Sound quality is poor but that's to be expected for the price and screen quality is very good as is build quality. Would highly recommend the docking keyboard case if you're going to be typing and it also has the added benefit of offering good protection when having the tablet in a bag as I usually do. Has enough RAM to support Spotify Chrome and Word processing quite comfortably when set to better performance in the battery menu and functions just like a mid range laptop with the docking keyboard.Would highly recommend if looking for a mid range tablet/laptop at an affordable price.
5,my wife needed a new tablet for her work as she has to write daily reports as her old iPad was getting too slow. saw this on amazon and it fitted her needs well. item arrived next day item was well packaged. on initial start up it required a few updates to get it up to speed with her needs. she found it a bit weird to begin with as she was so used to apps but after a few days of remembering how to use a windows based op system she now flies around the internet again. screen quality is very good although not quite matching an iPad retina display but more than adequate for day to day use. my wife is more than happy with her Fusion 5 tablet
5,Really impressed with my fusion 5 windows 10 tablet pc.For the price I paid £169.99 64gb version I am mightly impressed with the quality of this product & in my opinion this works on equal terms as your Apple or Samsung tablets which are afew hundred pounds more expensive.This is an absolute bargain at the price sold on performance looks software this could easily match the price of more expensive rivals on the market.I particularly like the slick thin design which make it a joy to handle.All in all I incredibly happy with my fusion 5 I would recommend this to everyone. I love it!!!!!
4,Wanted a Windows tablet for work and simple games.  Didn't want to spend at least twice as much on a Surface or equiv.  Tablet functions fine and totally meets my needs.  Does get a little hot when running games have to see how that affects it long term but no complaints ATM.
4,Quite an easy set up even for an older lady. Functions easy to access.Ordering good and delivery as expectedWould have liked white on black text on touch text have got  used to black on white..
4,Good value for money mostly doing what I need and I'm steadily learning Windows 10 as I go.Touch screen is a little temperamental (need to touch slightly higher than expected point on the screen) but again I'm getting to know it and adjust.Happy with this purchase - paired it with my android phone which is really useful.
5,This amazing buddy Fusion5 Ultra slim helps me a lot to expedite my e-learning required at work. The screen size is very ideal for doing assignment modules to run adobe flash required items. It's battery life fitted the require duration to study and review as well as to complete assessment task. Very light weight which I can carry it all the time while at work-- I keep it always in my bad as if it didn't add my baggies. This is very functional and easy to use. It's really fast processor and static downloads.I feel I am very capable of doing my modules assignment anytime anywhere. Big thumbs up for this product for being cheap and it gives me a productive days.
4,We use this for work on site so need something small and easy to carry while working on it. Very impressed with it and it performs well. There’s a couple of niggles but for the price they are very minor issues.
4,It didn't charge well. So I contacted Fusion. They asked me if I wanted the replacement or try with other charger. I decided to try wiht other charger but this didn't work. So I asked the replacement. They sent me the replacement. It is working well so far. I thought their costume service was quite good. I wanted 64 GB window 10 tablet with reasonable price. So it is good product for me.
3,The tablet itself it sturdy fast for the price and does everything I need it to do on a majority of wifi networks. However has a major flaw that Google searches has identified as a Windows 10 issue but not resolved. On certain networks when entering WiFi ID and password inputted characters clear in 2-5 secs so unable to use Wi-fi. More a Windows 10 issue but wishing I'd gone android for ease. As it stands a tablet I bought for work cannot be used at work.
5,I bought this a few weeks ago to replace an old Windows 7 tablet it came with Windows 10 1809 installed. When first powered up Windows updated to 1903 after running Disc clean up to remove old system files was left with 40 Gbytes of storage available for my apps. I am impressed with the performance all my apps run well.  It has a clear bright display the touch screen works well and battery life is good. It is lighter and slimmer than my old one so easier to hold. The only negative comment is that sound from the internal speakers is poor external speakers or bluetooth speakers/headphones sound much better. I am very pleased with this tablet great value for money.
4,Like the bigger screen nice and clear
4,Windows10 is not exactly user friendly. Screen picture is great but needs anti glare. Not as fast as expected but I think this is due to windows 10 - bring back windows 7!!.Nothing I cannot improve so I am very pleased with the product that I have bought replace an aging laptop and android tablet.
4,Really pleased with this a great piece of kit. Only downside is the internal speakers are a bit too quiet headphones or bluetooth speakers usually required.
5,Was not looking forward to receiving my FWIN232+ arriving as not being computer orientated I thought it would take ages to get it working. This proved groundless as once I charged the battery I had the unit running all my favourites on both Win.10 and Tablet within the hour. Unit is light and comfortable in use. All in all I am delighted with my purchase and my grandchildren are amazed that I managed to get it working before enlisting their help at the end of lockdown. Excellent product that I would recommend to anyone.👍
5,I'd been considering purchasing a Surface Pro with Windows 10 ever since my son bought one a couple of years ago but the cost was I felt prohibitive for my needs. It was he who suggested the Fusion5 tablet as an alternative. Looks like it's turning out to be suggestion of the year.After switching out of S-mode which allowed only Microsoft Apps to be installed and the Windows 10 updates had finished I had a fully functional portable computer. It paired easily with my bluetooth earphones and meets all my needs perfectly e.g.  surfing watching Youtube stuff listening to music or audiobooks etc whilst sitting in the yard rather than being 'shackled' to my desktop indoors.
5,This is an excellent Tablet. It's well made and keeps cool. Running Windows 10. It's very quick for such a small device and can even handle some light gaming. Half life 2 runs well at 720p with medium settings so when paired with a mouse it makes a great portable light gaming/media center. I also used a 128GB class 10 micro SD card.However  what let's it down massively is rubbish audio output. For example you cannot watch a film in an environment that's not absolutely silent because the speakers are rubbish. When you attach headphones you can hardly hear. So forget watching a film on an aeroplane because you can't hear a thing. This factor would stop recommending this tablet
4,Very good value tablet needed to run a piece of windows only software in a boating environment. Ideal for the purpose.I purchased the optional keyboard as well which had a UK layout despite the ad saying US layout. The keyboard is just OK - probably wouldn't buy that again but the tablet itself is great.
3,Well made and well presented. Screen is less responsive and reactive than rival devices. For the price it’s ok but don’t expect iPad style responses and speed. Whether that’s Windows or the device ... it’s hard to tell. Returned due to lack of speed and slow Wi-Fi connections. Not what I wanted.
3,I had to return the tablet. I used 4 external hard drives from small to large and none of them would appear in File explorer so I could not read them. I could see them in device manager. Otherwise the tablet was very good and clear. Now not sure whether to buy another one or not. The USB has put me off.
4,The FUSION Windows Tablet PC does exactly what it says.  It is a lightweight simple tablet.  Windows runs smoothly - the speed is OK and when docked in an external keyboard functions as an ideal laptop.For the price I would certainly recommend buying this
5,Bought this tablet to replace  my windows  7 laptop I've only had this tablet a few weeks but I have truly fallen in love with it.its graphics are amazing it comes with some free great apps already installed everything you touch on the screen is instant and just seems to flow along effortlessly.I just can't compare it at all with the laptop it replaced which took an age just to start up...I won't be using any outside apps that Google or similar want you to download at startup because in my experience they just fight with Microsoft products and are best left alone.would recommend to anyone who just wants to shop or book holidays or just browse .
4,I bought this so I had something to grab that was quick and easy to use rather than my laptop.  It's a well built good specification Windows tablet.  So far I have had no issues at all.  Very pleased with it.
4,This tablet PC is a great size for travelling set up was painless and it could be used straight away. Performance is good and expandable memory is a plus. Perfect to replace separate tablet and PC as it works as both (when purchasing the keyboard case). Would recommend!
3,I bought it for my son to introduce him to Windows it performs most functions adequately however I haven't tried running more demanding applications on it. The touch screen and picture are ok but the viewing angle is not the best the battery life is acceptable in normal use although it doesn't hold the charge for longer periods particularly well. The charge time could be better and it can sometimes run quite hot.
4,Bought thinking it was & easy android tab for an elderly person it wasnt suitable for that person they just refunded me with no hesitation very helpfull
5,Purchased along with the keyboard which functions as a case.  Working well as both a tablet and with the keyboard. Connects very easily with the keyboard. Feels like a quality product.  Touchpad on the keyboard is very sensitive to use so I've also bought a Bluetooth mouse.  I've always turned "taps" off on the touchpad on laptops in the past but can't find how to do it with this product.  Tablet comes with Windows S-mode installed which I'm planning to switch out of to normal windows as otherwise I can only install apps from the Windows Store.  Some information/warning on this would have been welcome.
4,Now using my laptop for work so wanted another device to watch films and keep in touch on. This has proven to be a great choice and links my Microsoft account for ease.
4,Size and performance for the price is very good. Tablet format is ok to use. I bought the keyboard but had to get it exchanged. Replacement works ok but you do need a flat surface not good on the lap. Good for watching movies . Generally happy with purchase
3,I've been pleased with this tablet overall. You can't expect an all-singing-dancing product at this price when you see how much tablets cost. It does all the basics effectively. The negatives are that I don't find the speed of response as quick as my laptop pc and the touch screen is not as responsive as it could be. However it represents very good valaue for money.
5,I bought this after struggling with the Amazon Fire HD because I just cannot put up with the constant advertising.As I use Windows 10 on my main PC I thought I wought give the Fusion 5 a go. My wife and I have 2 Fusion 5 phones that are really good and fulfil all our needs.So far the Fusion 5 Windows 10 tablet has performed pretty well it's obviously not quite as quick as the main computer but it serves me well on my travels. Great bit of kit that will be even better with a power supply.Well worth getting ***** 5 star rating.
5,I bought this tablet mainly to be able to work away from my desktop with programs which are only available on Windows. This does the job perfectly; it is a powerful computer which does everything a Windows computer does. I have now added the compatible keyboard making the set-up even more useful just like a small laptop. Would highly recommend.
5,The Fusion5 10" Windows tablet. I've only ever used big brand names in PC's ie. Toshiba etc. Thought I'd give this a go. It has good screen quality with very responsive touch. The build quality is very decent and it looks good with great battery life.The spec is great plenty of memory pretty fast full & micro USB ports & HDMI out. 64gb of storage insert up to 128gb tf card in this machine load most of your programs onto that and keep pc storage at max.Overall the Fusion5 tablet is well impressive I would certainly buy this brand again.
5,The tablet was easy to set up and nothing went wrong with initialising the functions I required. Windows 10 updated itself without any bother. I also had the Fusion 5 keyboard bought for me and it worked really well and it had a UK keyboard. The touch pad was responsive and I was quite impressed.One niggle is with the speakers. They are so faint you need to use earphones.On my home network I have 2 Android and 2 windows 10 machines. I use Fusion5 windows tablet  as the really portable windows device.
5,My wife was looking for a windows tablet because her old laptop was breaking down and she wanted something more portable but that could run her Windows apps and games. This does exactly what she wanted and without breaking the bank. its not too heavy but does feel solidly built it seems to run a bit faster than my netbook. My only gripe would be that windows on screen keyboard can be difficult to use but that is not the tablets fault and I'm sure I'll find an app that does it better soon. We've installed MS office and some small games and they seem to work great.
4,So far an excellent tablet that is and works exactly as it is described to. The main problem I have with it is its mini USB charge port it should be a USB type C which are much sturdier. Apart from that its excellent.
3,I like what this tablet represents but I'm struggling with it  especially when trying to input data. I can be filling in a fairly simple field whether constructing a spreadsheet or logging into one of my bank accounts etc and either the display I'm working on will just vanish or my cursor will be relocated to the middle of previously input data. This is with or without my docking station. I've upped my rating as I'm currently in touch with Fusion5 Support and have received advice.
4,22-Feb-2020 - Value for money tablet if you want to use Windows. Note running Windows S for security i.e. only install apps from the Windows Store - but you can revert to 'normal' Windows if you want.
4,This is a fine tablet fabulous value for money given how much you can pay for other brands. I've had it for a few months and have had no problems with it.
4,I bought this as a more portable laptop for travelling - lighter and takes up less space than a traditional laptop.  It's a bit slow to boot up but that is probably down to the OS rather than the product.
5,Whatever you expect of this little tablet you need to take into account it's price very low for a tablet this good. Everything I have thrown at it the tablet has managed to accomplish. Windows 10 works smoothly on here - the 4GB RAM makes a big difference. The 64GB storage also means you can keep Windows updated easily and still have enough storage space for everyday use. The addition of a full size USB port is really useful and allows easy additional storage options. The screen is clear and crisp sound is good as well. I rate this tablet higher than any Android device of the same size/price. Highly recommended.
5,Purchased 1 of these for commercial use and work perfectly as intended without breaking the bank. Easy to use right out of the gate runs Microsoft office apps well and is easy to use for surfing the net. Robust design and very nice that it comes with a screen protector already fitted! Would highly recommend as a budget option for portable windows capabilities.The tablet was so good that we have ordered a second one and will likely get more in the future when they are needed!
5,Arrived nice and quickly and so far seems very stable with a very clear screen. I have spent a bit of time putting my own programmes on it as I will be using it to do security surveys and produce specifications. Only one USB is a bit is a nuisance and the mini HDMI is a different mini HDMI connector to the one I have. I thought there was only one mini HDMI connection. Turns out I was wrong. It also has it's own charging cable and port so don't lose the charger! Battery is holding out well and it even has a screen protector on it already. So far it seems excellent value for money and I am very pleased with it.
4,works well and a bit faster after a tweek or two.  but seems to work well screen is nice and clear.but buy a power lead extension lead at the same time as you buy this product as the lead supplied is short.and the screen is much brighter on power.

3,I bought this for my partner mainly to use Skype (as this is now owned by Microsoft). Unfortunately when I opened Skype got a message saying could not log in for a number of reasons. After spending 2 hours researching the cause I realised it needed to be updated. Very unclear process. Anyway it seems to be ok now but we are in the early days of use so no real other feedback. It did come quickly though and we have registered for warranty.
5,The tablet works great handles everything i need it to do.Pros:+ Good screen quality+ Responsive touch screen (much better than others i tried)+ Windows 10 and Google Chrome run smooth with no stuttering.+ Build quality is good+ High speed USB port is great for data transfer and running an external dvd driveCons:- Sound quality is a little low from it's speakers but headphones or a Bluetooth speaker fixes that.Overall this tablet has exceeded my expectations and i would recommend it to anyone looking for a budget tablet.
4,Great little Tablet for travelling abroad with uses windows 10 just like my home computer with enough memory to load photo shop for processing my travel images whilst on site .Fast internet connecting for music and staying in touch when able to access Wi-Fi .would recommend this small but powerful tablet.
5,I have an operating system that is huge (nearly 1 TB) plus one of the best Digital Audio Workstations.This won't run on a Mickey Mouse system.  I have my OS mainly on an external drive with the core on the tablet.It works fine.  A great second processor for travelling with.Plus today I received the letter offering me a choice of not too shabby looking free gifts to write an unbiased review.I'll always grab a free gift if it looks decent.The docking keyboard would save having to carry separate mouse and keyboard.
5,I’ve for a long time wanted a tablet that could act as a better backup / alternative to my Windows laptop than an Android tablet but have been put off by price.  After spotting this tablet and purchasing the 64GB version I’m more than happy with it.  I’ve been able to load all my core applications without problems have linked both the Fusion 5 and my laptop to a secure cloud server holding all my active data and have achieved seamless use of either at any time.  Performance on the Fusion is much better than I expected.  Given the limitations of its specification highly recommended for the price.
4,Seems like a nice little machine but there is no way to play word games except with a mouse as the screen rolls every time you try to move a letter. Otherwise I would be rating it full marks.
4,Having previously used an iPad I've found this tablet to be a bit slow. Also the touch screen isn't as sensitive or as quick as I would have liked. However I'm sure I will get used to it.
5,I wasn’t sure what to expect after reading the reviews about the poor sound volume and although it was a bit echo-ey it was actually more than sufficient for what my dad (who got it as a gift) was planning to use it for - mainly for working on Office 365 files browsing the internet and taking pictures. For these purposes it’s a brilliant tablet very easy to set up and work on with very good battery life (compared to an ipad) so my dad is very happy with it.
5,The FUSION5 tablet arrived well packaged adequately protected and promptly.  Setting up was fairly straightforward despite a fairly protracted Windows update download using Wi-Fi.  The device had 64 GB in built storage which was extended with a similar sized microSD card.  It readily synchronised with my other Windows 10 machines and mobile phone.  The touch screen is responsive and a screen resolution more than adequate for a device of this size.  The sound quality is poor but it does have an earphone jack for the more discerning.  Although I have used it for only a few days at this juncture I’ve been pleased with its performance and the machine represents excellent value for money.
5,Overall when I first received the product I was skeptical as to whether the product would be as good as it is made out to be due to the low price. After using it for a few days my opinion was clear- it is great and just what I wanted. The delivery was quick the tablet is fast at starting up and when using the internet. Also the customer support was quick and efficient to respond when I asked what the correct keyboard is to suit this device. I would definitely recommend this tablet.
5,I was pleasantly surprised at the overall quality (especially picture quality) given the very low price; everything seemed to work smoothly following the initial setup; I haven't had it long enough to evaluate battery performance.  It is much better than my previous (non-branded) windows tablet which cost a similar amount a couple of years ago and I am very pleased to have finally replaced it with this one; also I appreciate having a full-size USB port as well as microUSB and a separate dedicated power supply (on my previous tablet power was through the single microUSB port which limited its useability).
4,It dose what it said on the box
5,I'm delighted with my Fusion5 Windows 10 tablet. It loads at lightning speed less than a minute and shuts down even quicker...  I have an Android tablet which I've never been satisfied with as it's functions are very limited. The best attributes of the Fusion5 tablet are it's light weight and the ability to sinc with my Windows 10 laptop. This means I only have to take the Fusion5 when I go out. All in all the Fusion5 fits my bill every time....
5,I bought this to replace my iPad and to be honest I didn't expect to be as impressed as I am with this tablet.  it has excellent battery life and is light weight enough to use anywhere.  I would definitely recommend this as ideal for all ages.  the set up was easy and I purchased the keyboard to go with this product and am equally pleased with that.  all in all for the price I paid this was really good value for money.
5,I wanted a portable device to replace my laptop.  Setting up the Fusion was very straightforward and Officee365 installed without any problems and I now have my emails in Outlook. I also have Word and Excell which I use a lot.  In addition I've installed a number of other Windows based Apps including a marine navigation system.  I am extremely pleased with the unit and have since added the docking case and keyboard which also work extremely well.
4,Really easy to use battery life appears to be good using for surveys so using for 5-6 hours in one stint. Would buy another...
4,I liked cortona talk through function to help set up seems to work fine so far. Very pleased bought for personal use so plenty of stuff on it for me still exploring functions.Didn't like Microsoft launcher because it changed all my mobile phone layout as it syncronised uninstalled it.
5,Had this tablet for a couple of weeks now. It has performed just fine. I have to admit that I am more of an Apple Mac devotee but felt I needed to have a windows machine too - This tablet fits the bill perfectly. I went for the 4/64gb version even here the processing and downloading can be a little slow but no worse than my old desktop. Sound quality is awful but using headphones it is fine.  Nothing else is below par. Just remember it is a tablet not a desktop and on that basis is amazing value for money. Highly recommended.
5,Had this Tablet  for some time  windows 10  version  is great .. Battery life is good  never turn  it  off  just let it sleep  Awakes  in an instant . For me this Tablet was  a bargain  would buy it again.
5,This is the first windows tablet I have had I usually have a laptop. After using this tablet it so much more convenient than a laptop and I dont notice any difference in the performance and it's a lot easier navigating with the touch screen. I would not go back to using a laptop after having this tablet the performance is as good it has a good battery life and is more compact and lighter to carry round and use on the go. Would recommend.
5,I have had a lot of these reasonably priced tablets over the years just for the mere fact that it was for work and liable to get damaged and inevitably they did until i found this here on Amazon.The fusion 5 is not only reasonably priced but works great as a tablet and as a conventional laptop.I would recommend to anybody wanting a quality tablet/laptop at a low price.
4,Wasnt keen. Very slow the screen quality isnt good and there is a lag when typing scar your money for something alot better i should have bought the chromebook
5,I have found this Windows 10 Fusion 5 tablet very user friendly just as thought you are using a computer  or laptop. The battery life is very long for its average normal usage. The cable connections on the side are very good for data transfer. I personally use a smart mobile and laptop this tablet allows me to start up and login quicker and easier to carry around with me.  The tablet is very secure for personal use for data security. I would recommend the tablet based on my recent purchase delivery and no fault use as of today.
1,Really disappointed with this product. I was swayed by the five star reviews but now wish I had never bought it. The battery life is abysmal; whenever I pick it up to use it the battery has always died. It takes forever to charge (5 hours from empty to full battery). There are also issues turning it on- I now power down the tablet in an attempt to preserve the battery but switching it on again is almost impossible. The power button often seems all but unresponsive. When you do finally switch it on be aware that if you lie the tablet flat the screen goes completely blank and it often enters sleep mode. So then you have to go through the whole process of logging in again. Very frustrating.Perhaps mine is just defective or maybe this is a larger problem linked to poor technology. I wish I’d never bought it as it just adds extra stress to an already hectic work day when as happened this morning I try to switch it on for a presentation and the battery is dead again.
3,The processor  is the lowest for this levelgood for kids as a basic  introduction  to PC. This would not be a delay drivermore power.the. is required .there be a better model in the price range.
5,I bought this tablet based on the specification and price. 4GB RAM and 64GB disk space along with quad cire processor USB HDMI and Bluetooth make this an impressive model at the price. Once I received the tablet I was also impressed with the build quality ease of use and general appearance. I have added another 128GB of storage with an SD card due to the amount of music and photos that I have. I am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone.
5,I have had a Fusion5 computer ( a lapbook ) before I purchased this tablet and I am impressed by both their form and function - graceful design  ultrathin and light  good connectivity including a separate charging port thus not having a usb port usurped  efficient wi-fi handling  hd screen resolution with vibrant colours and so a delight when watching videos including catch-up tv.I prefer Intel processor and Windows os and Fusion5 does ample justice to them at a most unflinching price ( being light on the pocket as well ).So with an appreciative thankyou I would give Fusion a high-5.
5,Excellent piece of kit for the money. The other reviews have said it all in terms of the technology and Windows 10 software. Whilst this 64GB version has plenty of storage space it also has a slot for another 64GB sd card to expand it even further. Delighted to have bought one of these and not forked out a fortune for an iPad!
4,I love it everything works perfectly only one suggestion I wish the sound was a little better but apart from thatworth every penny.
4,I made a mistake not having a replacement laptop as this tablet is too small and I have difficulty using it even with a dabber as I shake quite a lot otherwise it would be alright.
5,Very happy with this tablet it is very responsive and for its price still powerful enough to run modest games. It works perfectly for watching videos browsing the internet and the limited gaming I will do on it. I also bought the compatible keyboard and cover/stand which works great although the track-pad did not function correctly. Thankfully I got in touch with Fusion5 and they replaced it incredibly quickly for me so excellent customer service as well.If you're looking for a cheap Windows tablet but still want something with some kick for gaming this is an obvious choice.
5,I Bought this to run the Sufferfest app on in the gym and have not been dissapointed.  I know its a bit of an over kill to run the app on but the price you pay for the specs you get is a no brainer to purchase.  The only negative point is the speakers they are not great but if you have a portable speaker just hook that up and you will have no problems.  Big tip buy the case with the keyboard its a great stand for the tablet.
5,i was fed up of lugging my work laptop around while travelling for business so i purchased this along with a keyboard recommended to purchase along side the tablet. Its now so much easier to travel whether it be in the UK or taking abroad. All of my programs work on this and it was easy to set up.Great value for money would highly recommend
1,Oh dear where do I start? I wanted this tablet to work... I tried to like it but it came with bubbles under the screen like (looked line either bad in transit or over heating of the plastic in the manufacturing process). The touch screen was also lose felt like the thing would fall apart in a week or two... I tried it for a couple of days but it did not have a response touch screen. Plus it over heats in light use and charging so much that I didn’t trust it at all to be left alone charge. Add in that it just was a pain to switch on kept having to press the power button a number of times in combination with the volume to make it work. I will say that I was sad that it was so bad. Cannot help but feel that it could have done with more money spending on some for the key components then it would have been fine. Sent back for full refund. Fusion 5 where very good at the refund processing. Just wish that their tablet had worked out.
2,I read Crystal Brooks review and would concur with what they said.I found it very slow as a device frustratingly so unfortunately.Sound is pretty bad as already stated and you think you are willing to compromise on sound until presented with tinny sound and then you realise you probably need it to be slightly better to be tolerable.Full size ports incl. usb and hdmi very handy and very good.
5,Replaced android Fusion5 for Windows 10s and really pleased. Superb value for money.  Windows 10s will only allow downloads through Windows Store but you are able to take the s element off permanently and download from elsewhere.  I bought a case from Tesco which you can easily adapt but you have to remove it to use the camera which by the way is far superior than the previous model.
4,It is really comfortable to use .... With windows ten. I enjoyed using it. It  works as a laptop tgats most amazing about it.
5,This 10" tablet unexpectedly performs very well.I was able to install very heavy software like Matlab Mathematica (see attached screenshots) and get them running flawlessly and with ease (though the computations can take double the time than a normal PC). The approx computing power (FLOPS) measured by the LINPACK benchmark is around 5.6 GigaFlops which is on a 10" tablet very outstanding. The tradeoff between portability price efficiency is just fantastic. Looking forward to having very productive days ahead!
5,Good value quality tablet.Bought for my daughter as she wanted something for college work that wasn’t a laptop and is easy to carry. Got a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard to go with it when she wanted more of a laptop style at home. All links perfectly and she is delighted
4,Only had it a few days & no problems at all
5,this is the 3rd fussion I have purchased over a number of year. This one is a present for my wife as she kept borrowing my tablet so now she has her own. Well built slim and just feels good in my hands.
1,The battery life is terrible and our device will freeze for 2 hours or longer which is just inconvenient. When it freezes you cannot press anything on the screen and the buttons don't do anything so you cannot turn it off either. Additionally we purchased two of these tablets when the second one arrived the screen again didn't work. We had to send it back before we could even use it. Now the 1st tablet is playing up and they won't issue a refund even though we signed up for the warranty.. We would not buy this again even if I was the last tablet on earth
5,it's really good as it goes. Like any windows tablet the os needs a really good tweak for speed. This is especially important for cheaper tablets like this one so if you don't know how to do this find out.  Out of the box it's sluggish battery life is below average and it gets pretty hot. With the load taken off through tweaking windows 10 it's vastly improved and let's face it it's speed we're all looking for eh?. Built quality it's ok stick it in a case and you wouldn't tell much difference.
4,Top quality product at a great price - good quality design and easy to setup Windows 10 - battery life good with excellent screen quality.
4,Not the quickest TabletBut tablet after 1 months use accepts all updates and still works ok
4,This is great value for money. Full Windows functionality that performs well and reliably on this high spec tablet. It is light and feels well made
5,Looks good works as it should great value for money. My only quibble is not with the kit but with setting up Windows on it. It requires a Microsoft account and the process of doing that is opaque to say the least. Depends on what you use it for of course but unless you want to link to other Microsoft products I would recommend you choose the Android version.
5,I wanted a tablet that used Windows but didn’t want to fork out for a Microsoft one.Looked on Amazon and found the Fusion5 with 64gb. Read the reviews and took the plunge. Really surprised and delighted. Set up was easy and I bought a 128gb card to increase storage. Also bought the matching case / keyboard (it is a UK one despite the description on eBay).It does everything I want and am very pleased. The only criticism is the sound - not much volume.
5,A value for money product.I was quite happy with the build quality  aesthetics and processor speed.The only disadvantage is the lack of service centres though being manufactured in UK.My screen cracked and I am not able to get it replaced and Fusion service center service costs are close to 60£ for replacementwhich I feel is quite steep.
5,I have always used a laptop or desktop up to now but bought this hi-spec tablet for a Christmas present to myself. It fires up quickly and is very easy to use. I also bought a case complete with stylus which takes away the frustration of tapping the screen multiple times with your sausage fingers. I am no tech guru but it works for me.
5,Quality in build is good used in a SQL projects and so far so good. Worth getting the model.
5,Exactly what I wanted a well built good value for money windows tablet to use as a portable device in a shop to take orders etc. A much better option that an expensive ipad and more versatile as it runs full windows. Very Happy
5,De las mejores compras que he hecho. Por sólo 300€ tienes una buena tablet con Windows 10. Obviamente no sirve para jugar a videojuegos nuevos. Pero viene muy bien para trabajar.
4,Lot of possibilities you have not with android. Especially with more than 100 Go of pictures and videos to keep in good order.  But using windows 10 could be difficult for many people.
1,Very disappointed of the device performance is performing very slow overallTook several hours to update WindowsWhen I installed my antivirus based on subscription I received the message that the system is to slow in order for the antivirus to work and installation is not recommend itI still installed the antivirus and perform full scan it took several hours and the scan was not finished was at 65%On my laptop Intel 7th generation full scan with the same antivirus is performed under 20min on the same Windows 10 platformeIs struggling / impossible  running 2 tasks at the same timeGraphics touchscreen functions design of the tablet are good no issues.Windows for tablets still a chalange probably next generations of tablets will copeI will try an Android tablet.Conclusion. This tablet is a waste of time for any individual person trying to manage efficient his time.
5,For what I paid for this I wasn't expecting much but I have been surprised. I make a lot of use of Microsoft Office 365 products and this tablet handles them very well. The speed as expected is not ultra fast but it is good enough for all my needs on the go. The low weight of the device means that it is also very good for reading ebooks on.
5,The item is working satisfactorily. I have not as yet used it extensively
4,I like this product is number one tablets I ever had. Fusion5 will be my favourite product .
3,Ok is not bad but the cable doesn’t charge it so i had to use a new one that i’ve boUght camera is not very good and word excel etc isn’t included so you have to buy them i need to buy the keyboard but given that the cable didn’t work I’m wondering if it is worth buying it
5,Wanted a small light windows laptop and saw this which when added to a docking keyboard was exactly what I wanted.  Ok it’s not the fastest laptop but when you’re on the move and need to have a windows pc handy this does the job.  I’ve used an iPad for many years but if you need to work in MS Office especially Word then you want one of these.
4,I bought this  Tablet PC for my 6 year old son and I am satisfied with its use. It is a handy mini PC.
5,My dad wanted a new tablet to replace one which kept on crashing after a little set up (getting chrome Netflix etc) he has been using it non stop and has had no complaints. For the price it’s great with a good load speed able to handle a few tasks at the same time with no slow down and with a good battery life. Overall a nice unit we can recommend.
5,Ibought this tablet to save me always to having to climb stairs to room where my ageing w10 laptop is. I set up my gamesutubeemail facebook etc in no time. It runs fast enough for mehas great video quality. and good battery life for my purposes.  All in all a great buy!!!  RozyC
5,I bought this tablet for my Son for Christmas he plays games on it mostly. He's very happy with the overall product but sometimes it can lag but this is when playing games like Roblox which takes up alot of ram. So it's great for smaller games. And it keeps his younger Sister entertained for hours.
5,I am 92 years of age and wanted a small Windows 10 Tablet to keep track of my banking transactions on a spreadsheet. I found this  Tablet to be ideal. I also found it great for doing Jigsaws and Scrabble. Picture quality fine and battery life is okay for my needs. Definitely value for money.
5,Purchased this tablet device for my 11 year old for Christmas so she could play Minecraft and Roblox. Read a number of reviews about tablet PC's not being suitable for these games but took the chance and found this one to be perfect. Nice smooth frame rate on both games so my daughter is a very happy bunny.
4,Good screen quality excellent value problems with touch screen accuracy not always responding first time
4,I like the product considering I have always used iPad. Good product and good value.
5,This is my first tablet and I am very impressed with it. All the features of a laptop/desktop computer but a lot sleeker and stylish.The screen quality is excellent for watching movies and the touch screen is very responsive for playing games or surfing the web.Storage can be increased up to 256gb.All in all an excellent purchase.
4,Tablet keyboard  is sometimes unresponsive and Windows tablet mode does not work all that well with touch screen but other than that it is a decent tablet with good IO
5,Previous tablet was android and had failed but had been good service I wanted a replacement with Windows I bought  8" But failed and could not get one at my price I got this Fusion after reading reviews and price and have very happy with it. On power up windows did some updates successfully and after a short time I was entering my details The onscreen keyboard is good battery life seems good so far and screen very good Would definitely Recommend.
5,Bought this to use with my printer to print for work and it does exactly what It is supposed to do if you're not using it for any power intensive work. I am happy with the full size USB that comes with this unit. It helps me avoid the use of multiple adaptors.
5,The Fusion5 was purchased for my wife who is not particularly computer literate. Commonly referred to as PICNIC in our home when it comes to computing. (Problem In Chair Not In Computer). My wife was able to set it up on her own and is extremely pleased with the functionality it affords her.
4,It's of the right size light weight and my computer on the move!
3,A bit disappointing as I have previously had kindle fire HDs.  The sound without headphones is very poor and with headphones can be a struggle even after resetting the settings!  No tablet apps available as this is a windows based product but otherwise it is fine.
5,I can't fault this tablet but it is no good for me I play games and I needed to replace my android device this Windows one will not work with android games you can get some games but you can't load your already archived levels you have to start again so I don't really know what to do with it its not faulty just no good for me
4,Light compact & easy to use. Good value for money.
5,Only recently purchased but incredibly impressed so far!Easy and quick to set-up. Very responsive and user friendly.An excellent value option for anyone looking for a Windows tablet - highly recommended
5,No me ha gustado que viniera con enchufe UK. He tenido que buscar un adaptador. No especificaba esto por lo menos claramente.Me planteé pedir funda con teclado pero no me arriesgo a que no sea en español.
4,I used for my personal life and at the moment I learning to used and I can see the advantages will bring to me. I only find a little slow in downloading things.
3,Touch screen not always working takes few times to sometimes get to work.  Find very slow. Maybe keyboard would help. Screen quality very good though
4,It's a neat lil thing but the sound is very low my phone is louder for watching films
5,Bought for my wife for her birthday. She wanted a Windows-based tablet and after a lot of searching I found this. She utterly loves it and has already integrated it into her tech set up. She uses this more than her laptop now.
4,The set up instructions aren't the best!  not super fast in running Facebook or Messenger.  On screen keyboard obscures most of the screen you're using.
5,First noticeable like for me was the fact it had windows that was a must.To be able to take it to the flying field rather than a laptop was also a must.With 4gig of ram it pretty fast64gig of memory is good but 128 would have been better but having said that 128gig sd card works well.My own opinion I'm glad I purchased it
5,The Fusion5 is the best tablet I have used very satisfied with the way it handles Windows 10 it is very good  value for money the various outlets let me connect to remote hard drive mouse and keyboard. Build quality is very goodthe processor and graphics are fine as well having a full size USB mini USB HTMI Bluetooth and WiFi connections for external devices.
5,does exactly what it says on the can
1,This item worked well for about two weeks then the touchscreen stopped working. I followed instructions to reset and it the machine froze during the re installation of windows 10. At this point I would have sent it back but I had already installed a tempered glass screen protector and this would have probably nullified my chances of a replacement. I installed a fresh copy of windows 10 successfully but the touch screen and touch rotate and other things don't work now. I have been searching for 4 days to find appropriate software or drivers but even the support section of F5CS website is devoid of anything helpful. In fact  it is devoid of anything at all apart from a few pcs similar to mine for sale. For a windows tablet I will definitely go for a Surface next time and I would reccomend you do the same if only for proper support.
5,I bought the product to supplement my laptop. I found the performance to be great in terms of loading pages the touch ability of the screen and longevity of the battery.I would recommend to anyone interested in affordable tablet.
4,Great for the money!
5,Looks good Slim-line light-weight and easy to use. The touch screen is fine and graphics are excellent.  Easily Linked up to my PC which is really useful.  the battery life seems very good so far. Although have only been using this tablet for a few weeks it seems more than adequate for my needs and represents great value for money
4,I bought this product to replace my 7 inch Linx tablet which I use for playing games and was really impressed with the quality
5,This is great value for money!  I bought it to replace my ipad.  I also bought the case and together they make a great bit of kit.  Love the usb port and the extra card storage facility.  I can't seem to get a great volume level but perhaps I need to look into this further but have only just got it - it arrived very quickly too!  I would certainly recommend this to anyone.
1,After 18 months it started playing up....camera stopped working properly support suggested reset. Now I can't use it at all because the keyboard is unusable as it is tiny!!
5,A well built and easy to use tablet .The usb port is a very useful feature and the neat charger is handy.
5,Bought this tablet for my Son's birthday.  He was quite specific on the features he wanted. The Fusion had them all. He was delighted with it. I spent a lot of time searching for the right tablet for the price Fusion beat the others. Very happy with my purchase.
5,These tablets are being used in my baby scanning clinic to show clients images of their unborn babies.The picture quality is excellent and they're very lightweight.
5,This tablet replaced my four year old W8.1 that has had screen over charge issues. Very pleased with the F5 running W10 it has good memory and takes a micro SD card the only thing I have a niggle with is the power cable being only 1100mm long meaning it's nearly impossible to use if you are changing looking for a longer cable at the moment other than that this is a great unit for the price
5,super fast and super quality amazing tablet for the price the core processor is quick but be careful there two versions 2GB RAM not recommended and the 4GB RAM which is the best. don’t get the RAM mixed up as you be disappointed with 2GB RAM make sure you buy the 4GB RAM one. it’s quick fast reliable and put major competition to shame
5,just a good priced little bit of kit
1,DO NOT BUY! I was going to give this a great review as it worked perfectly alone and with the keyboard and stylus I bought to go with it. I bought this as a portable sketchpad not to use as a pc. The only extra app downloaded was sketchpad and it seemed perfect and very reasonably priced. Unfortunately this honeymoon period was soon to end. It soon started beoming a bit jittery lagging a bit. Bought Feb 21st by the 1st of March it wouldn't charge bought a new charger still no joy. Now returning. Waste of time.
4,Early days yet and bought for my wife it will come in very jandy for what we need it for I am sure!
4,Great little tablet almost inaudible sound quality though.
4,Lovely tablet but slow at opening programs. Doesn't like connecting to Bluetooth barcode scanner correctly.
5,The tablet is sleek and well designed. The screen is clear and responsive. It runs on Windows 10 which is simple to use and logical. The price is reasonable for this kind of tablet. The tablet was bought specifically to use at work so being over the Christmas holidays we haven’t used the tablet to the full extent yet but it looks like it is going to do everything we hoped it would.
5,We purchased this as a POS computer for our shop and it is working absolutely fine. It is plugged in all the time so not really sure how good the battery is but it does seem to last well. slightly slow at booting up but that’s  probably reflected in the price and processor speed.
5,Good value which i'm enjoying using.It is just the right size to take travelling. We will use it a lot.I use just as my computer.Battery lasts about 24 hours when not in use but not so long in use. I can deal with that. I find closing the open windows uses less battery.
5,I am on my second fusion5 ultra slim 10" Windows10. The previous one lasted 2 years used daily before an unfortunate accident resulted in its demise. The improvements to the latest model mean twice the memory of the last one & much faster start up. The full size usb3 is a real plus. Hence the 5 star rating.
5,It's a Windows 10 tablet with SD HDMI full size USB.It has arrived very fast and the set up was very easy.I do recommend the 64 GB version as the windows 10 will take a lots of space after updates. You also can add SD card up to 128 GB.I bought a Docking Case with Keyboard as well which is perfectly works with the tablet.Best Windows Tables and value for the money.
5,Bought this to replace a HP Stream 11(32GB storage). The HP machine has been a pain having only 32GB when updating windows. The fusuion5 having 64Gb makes windows updates much easier. The 4GB ram gives good performace and having two usb ports allows a mouse and storage at the sane time. Battery life seems to be around 8 hours on best performace setting so very good. Now have also purchased the case with keyboard.
2,Nice product not sure I love windows on a tablet but its familiar and workable.Issues:  This wont play 1080p videos without having lots of buffer problems despite being advertised as 1080p forget watching youtube in high quality.Charging cable - if at the wrong angle wont charge and this is a brand new cable.Not terribly impressed with this purchase workable but not amazing
5,Only had a few days but really pleased with it screen is very responsive battery seems good overall very pleased.
2,I got this tablet for its Windows OS and I also bought a keyboard case to use with it. All worked fine for 9 months when the touchscreen stopped working.  It thinks it has pressure on certain areas of the screen (right were the tabs are for chrome browser) so continuously switches between tabs and windows and doesn't recognise your actual taps. Can't even log out of systems or restore factory settings.
4,Okay quite good for the price.
5,I was pleased when using the tablet. It is a tad slow but it is perfect for browsing or writing an email or using word/open office. The sound quality is poor so for watching YouTube videos or Netflix. It has an aux output so using headphones is no problem and it also connects to Bluetooth divices.
2,The product did not answer me. I bought for editing images in an advertising company but it is impossible to use the touch-screen. Thus it became impossible to use it. Another problem is that even with 4GB of RAM the CPU is processing are always at 100% and after searching a lot I saw that it is a. Factory problem and tried to remedy the problem in different ways but none worked. The tablet is heavy very large edges and slides on the table. For the price I found the tablet bad.
4,Very good purchase. The only flaw it charges too long for 5 hours.
3,Just don't buy anything with fusion on it worked ok for a couple of months then screen won't rotate and poor build .
5,This tablet is excellent value for money.  It is ideal for people familiar with windows and is exactly the same as your windows 10 pc except that it is touch screen.  The screen is good quality.  The only feature that isn't good is the speakers which are quite poor.
5,I prefer to use Windows products and this tablet fills the bill. It was easy to set up seems robust and I am pleased with the purchase. I use it mainly for web search and reading previously prepared PDF documents.
5,Bought as a substitute for my laptop when travelling to Australia so purchased with the keyboard case extra. Worked brilliantly added a micro sd card to increase storage for photos taken and used with external hard drive. Found it easy to use and compact for travel. Would recommend.
5,Great product with brilliant memory. We struggled to find a 'tablet' with a good memory without a stupid price. Fusion is the best value tablet we have ever had.Just need to find a good cover/screen protector/carry case (as we use this out on building sites) - if anyone knows?
5,Very nice tablet for the money once set up for your own use the version of windows 10 is better than my 17'' hp laptop.Buy the case/keyboard separately as you get a uk keyboard not usa set up ( no £ sign only $) among other things. I'm not an android fan so choice was limited but so pleased with this capable little tablet.
5,This is a great Windows Tablet for the price. Fast to load with crystal clear graphics make this tablet one of the best on the market for under £200. Highly recommended....
5,I ordered the Fusion5 tablet just for a backup to my main laptop but I am so impressed with it's performance speed and ease of using it I can see me using this most of the time. And with the bonus of windows 10 which I am use to using.Well done Fusion a real value for money product.Thanks to Amazon for good prompt service as always
5,Excellent product easy to use  only problem is has a short battery life seems to loose its charge even when not in use . It is most suitable for storing all my photos & documents easier to use & more convenient than a laptop
3,Great budget Windows 10 tablet.  Highly recommend purchase at this great value price.
5,For this pricethis is a bargain. Great tabletbattery is goodbut if you have it set to full processing power in the battery settings it is going to run empty a lot faster. Screen is good toosure it is not full hdbut on this small screen you won't even notice it
5,Excellent product arrived as promised on time. Very easy to set up and use downloaded all my favourite programs and aps very quickly including Microsoft Office which I use across all my devices. I thoroughly recommend this product.
4,Excellent tablet no problems whatsoever and im enjoying the use of it everyday! Superb!
5,I was dubious but the Fusion 5 has turned out to be a great product. Using as a spare for my Surface Pro 4 but the rest of the family also like it so it's getting a good deal of use we even took it on vacation!Highly recommended.
4,Great neat tablet
4,A good basic tablet
4,WAS A PRESENT FOR WIFE SHE LOVES IT JUST THE RIGHT SIZE AND EASY TO USE
4,Bought it for my husband it arrived quickly and he seems pleased overall.
5,Bought this for my  5 year old daughter for Xmas and she loves it. Took a bit of getting used to windows 10 as I use 7 but she has found everything on it she wants to. I’m glad I spent a few evenings getting it child friendly particularly as the first thing you have to do is charge it for 7 hours
5,This is an excellent product and offers great value for money. I bought it for travelling as a device to watch Netflix on as well as having the functionality to manage video files. It does this seemlessly and the quality of the picture is excellent. With it being a Windows Product the management of files is easy. It’s a no brainier to buy this.
5,The Fusion5 has overcome my expectations considering its cost.Certainly the best price/quality relationship option if you're looking to purchase a windows tablet/pc without draining your funds completely.I highly recommend this product.
5,I have found this to be a good value for money Windows touchscreen tablet PC that performs as well as you would hope it to. I have bought a 2nd one for use in my business.
5,One of the best available windows os device to do your basic day to day task.Very easy and quick to setupNumber of options best one is usb interfaceSound is not one of the best but still does the jobMay be bigger bessel needs to go away and high resolution
5,Great little Windows 10 tablet. Go for 4Gb RAM and 64GB SSD model.  It's worth the extra money.  Windows 10 needs as much memory and disk as you can give it. If you use it a lot for typing then I'd get the case and keyboard.
2,it’s slow unresponsive and feels cheap. Takes ages to charge then drains it really quickly.
5,Great customer service and speed of obtaining this product. Product quality is very good and would definitely purchase from this company again in the future. Highly recommend!
5,works well enough but needs some patience with response time. If all goes well I plan to use it in place of my laptop.I find that it adequately replaces a laptop for all general purpose uses' and is less cumbersome.
5,Easy to set up and find way round . Very pleased
4,Tablet works fine. It is stylish my grandkids love it.
5,This product was bought for my husband who is using it for astro-photography (chosen for its USB 3 port and 4GB RAM).  Setting up came with step-by-step instructions on screen which worked perfectly.  Installation of necessary astro programmes was faultless testing with a high speed video camera was successful.  Would recommend this as great value.
2,Very disappointing takes an age to load up after pressing the on button. Not like other tablets I've had would have better to just go for a kindle like I did have. Battery is poor (when decides to work). Touch screen isn't that great. Only the screen quality is good.  I will know next time.
5,I loved this tablet.  I now have a bluetooth mouse and everything works brilliant.  I loved Fusions tablets so thought I would try this one. And believe me its great.  Internet works well for what I need before I have had to download Puffin but don't need to Browser does everything I need.
5,I really like this product.The battery life is good..Screen is very clear.I love that it can be used with keyboard docking or as a tablet.Loved so much bought a second one so both my husband and I have one
2,Windows 10S is an absolute pain in the neck if you want normal windows 10 you have to open an account with Microsoft.I buy quite a few and sell them on with my product so really don’t want to open a Microsoft account to get the full version.
5,This is a great little tablet.  Handy to keep in your bag without the weight of a laptop but all the use and functionality of one.  Loads up quickly.  Great screen quality. Does everything I need it to.
5,Great tablet/pc. We use it for the kids homework and so far have had no problems. We also have some sim builer apps and the screen is brilliant. So far so good
5,Good battery life easy to set up like the Windows 10 operator quality of front facing camera not very clear a little fuzzy I found.
5,I am extremely pleased with my Tablet PC it is very good value for money The picture quality is wonderful and it's download speed is really quick. This Tablet PC is just what i need when i am away from home in my caravan it is slimline and very lightweight. I would certainly recommend this Tablet.
1,I bought this along with the docking station. As an 86 year old I found it fairly straight forward to set up. I use it with a Bluetooth mouse and headphones. My only complaint is the poor sound volume even set on 100%. Hence the headset and only 4 stars.This device came with an inbuilt driver error which after 6 months I have been unable to resolve. As a result I have been unable to CREATE A RECOVERY DRIVE. So any serious faults and you have to buy a new tablet. Therefore I have reduced my rating to 1 star.
1,I really wanted the windows functionality and having a usb port was really appealing. Windows runs well and really fast but the wifi is terrible 350meg download on my phone and struggling to get 5 on tablet. Also I plugged into my printer to print and it goes nuts like the screen is getting touched opens windows programs really annoying.I emailed about terrible wifi and they asked me to send for repair but I am going on holiday tomorrow so I ordered a USB wifi adapter so I can still use it.May still return as faulty as just doesnt feel right doesnt feel solid as I think it should.
4,Brilliant little tablet.
5,When the Puffin app went down on my iPhone I couldn’t manage my website. So I needed something small and fast that I could carry around with me the Fusion5 is ideal it’s fast and quick. Perfect for what I need.
5,Great for what i need it for. Got it due to the fact it has a full size USB port but is also coming in handy keeping the kids occupied. Would definitely be interested in getting the keyboard case to go with it. Fast delivery all round good product good sellers :)
4,Very good and easy to use.
5,The Fusion 5 is a good Windows tablet. It is quite fast considering the price. Easy to use. When I first used it it did freeze but I think that was due to one of the apps I downloaded because it worked again once I deleted that.No issues with it so far.
5,This is a lightweight easy and so far been impressed with it. It was really easy to set up and fast tablet. I bought it because i was going into a lot of Journey so i could watch Tv/movies and play games . Overall i think this powerful tablet with great value for money.
5,Excellent purchase. Light and compact but all the ability of a PC with good storage and USB  port for ease of transfer and organising  of files Excellent price as well which always has to be considered.
3,Value for money
5,This has proved to be an ideal substitute for my laptop easy to use and I might add a lot faster. It was easy to set up and easier still after logging in to my windows account so far very pleased with my purchase.
5,Product was delivered quickly and as a gift for my daughter . Very pleased with the responsive touch screen and capabilities of this value for money tablet :-)
5,I like the use of it as to helpful at work and I wish there is ragged case on full like other tablets pc .
5,I have only had this Fusion5 10 inch Windows tablet for one day but it was very easy to set up and I am now up and running on the same basis as my fully fledged Windows desktop computer. So far so good!
5,Nice size good for money. Unfortunately has a tough time playing videos that are 720p and above and the touch screen will sometimes (although rare and easy to fix) bug out.
5,I liked everything about this Tablet PC it is compact and comes with Windows 10. a USB and a HDMI socket. It is more convenient to take anywhere than a normal laptop but has the same uses.
5,I brought this as a Christmas present for my husband. He was absolutely delighted and finds it very easy to usefor an absolute non technical person!
5,Delivery arrived a day early. Tablet is ideal for my needs had it running in minutes using software normally run on the laptop PC. The wifi antenna has excellent range operates well in areas where my phone hardly registers a signal. I'd definitely recommend this tablet.
5,Excellenttechnology in such a small package much better than expected great value for money much better than I was hoping for especially as it has a USB port which a pen can be used.
5,Great little devicebetter than i thought it would beall the windows features as far as i can tellhandy having a usb 3.0 port as well.
5,I am very pleased with my purchase. Just wish there were more hours in the day to use it. I am satisfied.
5,This is a great product. Used to purchase a competitors unit and have now selected Fusion for our company tablets.
1,I have known Man Utd fans that respond quicker than this. I bought it purely for YouTube for my kid no other apps on it. Terrible.
5,I like this product very much and find that it is very quick to use the screen is excellent far better than I'd expected in this price range.It charges rapidly and lasts for hours. I'm very happy that I chose this item. Thank you
2,Very slow to respond to touch. Screen quality not the best. Didn't inspire any confidence. Returned mine
5,Lightweight and easy to hold. Mainly used for shopping and playing games. A little surprised charging performed through DC charger and not USB portbut works adequately.
5,Perfect for what i required it for. Not the fastest tablet in the world but acceptable especially for this price. arrived next day so no complaints.
1,Worked OK for five days then broke. Probably Ok for doing the basics but anymore no. If you can afford more then I'd go for a different product. Very easy to set up though just a shame it stopped working. Catastrophic fail no power nothing. Will be looking elsewhere next time.
5,I spent a long time looking for my 1st tabletim a desktop guyand i wanted windowsthis is an amazing little bit of kitok not had longbut so far so goodso glad i didnt spend 3 times the amount on a more well known branded product.
2,good product but loads of problems with getting the right parts delivered - they fixed the issues but it took time which is the first time I have had issues with products from Germany ... I would not order again
5,Bought this for my sister for her Xmas to replace her old 2nd generation iPad. It's really great value for the price. If you're looking for something more affordable than an iPad but with a decent spec then I highly recommend this tablet.
5,I only bought and promptly received this tablet a few days ago am getting to know it and so far I am really pleased with it. The delivery service was really excellent. A very worth while replacement of my aged Acer Iconia! Thanks.Sofarsogood
5,What an excellent little tablet. Quick response and good looking piece of kit. Price was very competitive and the delivery super quick - very pleased with purchase!
3,I am struggling to use this machine.
5,Brilliant value for money! High quality picture good battery life and very easy to use. Would recommend for anyone!
1,I have bought another one hoping that I was unlucky with the first one. However I do have concerns about it's reliability and the apparent failure to prove an option to recharge from a 12v DC socket or from a USB connection.
5,Excellent quality image for the money. Processing power average.Slightly got delay using the touch screen.Docking keyboard is essential if you want to use it as a second pc.
5,I found that the tablet was easy to use.  I use it mainly for online shopping browsing  the internet and playing games.
5,The tablet is going back to the seller. It didn't connect with either mobile line or my provided lnternet.
5,Business and pleasure .the fusion5 ticks all the boxes what more can l say it didn't cost the earth and has everything you want in a computer.
5,Was looking for a cheap windows tablet for video simple games web browsing and basic office work. I purchased this along with the docking case with keyboard and both work excellently. You will struggle to find better value for money.
5,I bought this for my granddaughter she is 14 and like most kids knows all and she loves it and size of screen is much better than tablets for same price
1,thought would try a new windows 10 pad to see how it compares to thev upgrade on my laptop mistake seems slow as in back in the days of steam  needs another shovel full of coal. Not enough screen brightness seems to disappear in bright conditions. Lots of things I don't like about it could not recommend to anyone. Think I am going to bin it and go back to android.
5,Got this for my husband to use for work at home. He hasn’t used all functions yet but is happy with it so far.Good size screen and easy to use. Good value for money. Would highly recommend!
5,I like the soze weight. It’s really cool
5,This really is the best tablet on the market for this price - it's the 3rd one we've bought for our business and all 3 are working hard for us.
1,The tablet arrived dead no power and would not turn on at all. Plugged in to charger for hours but still dead. The build quality of this item is very poor cheap. It feels like it would break very easily. The screen looks and feels thin with odd bumps and dips on it. Returned for my money back.Don't be fooled by the cheap price and high specification of this tablet it's just poorly made. Won't last long if it works at all.But to be fair the return process was quick and easy.
5,Bought this as a Christmas present great quality and does everything I need it for at a great price
5,Great quality tablet very easy to use. Great battery life. I'm very happy
5,4gb of ram & 64gb storage should make for a useful windows tablet at a very competitive price.This is an upgrade from the 32gb tablet and loaded windows much quicker with spoken info from Cortana which was very helpful!
5,Great for the price. Not had Amy problems are all. Happy I bought it.
1,This item will no longer turn on now and i went back on Amazon and there doesnt appear to be a way to return item as its not 12 months old. Before this the item is not that good touch screen response is poor the speakers are awful I guess you get what you pay for.
5,I need a portable tablet to take with me when going away on business. The Fusion has proved ideal and is now a permanent fixture on my trips
5,This product is great more than just a tablet its quick enough to call a PC too. Really easy to use and can flip between tablet mode or desktop mode seemlessly. Very good buy at a great price.
5,This is everything a Windows tablet should be very pleased and a great price!Thank you.
5,Great product would recommend got rid of my old PCs the sound isn't fantastic but that's a minor gripe if you're connecting a Wi-Fi printer download the drivers for your printer otherwise you could have problems connecting
5,So far so good. The tablet is robust and specifications are very good at a reasonable price!
5,Great tablet I'm using for the Zwift cycling appquick great display and good battery life
5,Haven't used it much as yet but looks very good. Looking forward to having a good having a good day on it. Thank you.
5,Compact and excellent value for price; would recommend! Bought a keyboard for it and combined make an excellent alternative to carrying around a much larger laptop.
5,An excellent tablet brought to replace an aging Acer
5,Excellent tablet bought it for my 9 year old's birthday. She is over the moon. It is very lightweight with really good screen quality.
5,Excellent product that arrived quickly and has comprehensive instructions. It was just what I wanted which was a tablet sized device with Windows 10.
5,Great little tablet powerful quick and pretty good battery lifeAdded bonus of having a USB 3 really put it above the rest.
5,More convenient than android. Does what I want it to do.
5,Bought 2 of these tablets - one as a present and one for travel necessities. Screen excellent. Only downside so far is that the volume is a little disappointed but perfect with speakers.
5,This is a great product overall; Windows 10 runs well battery life is good and does everything i need in terms of web-browsing running applications etc.  Great price can't go far wrong!
5,Love this product. The interface is super quick and easy to use and when connected to my phone turns it into a Windows phone! Going to make my life so much easier! Definitely recommend!!
5,I wanted a laptop but small and easy to use plus portable
5,Great little tablet wasn't expecting much for the price but it's great. Windows version with full usb and bluetooth to connect my camera and phone
5,Great item I purchased this to replace a netbook that was terrible! Has more storage than my netbook and for the price is fantastic! I purchased the keyboard and case which also works well.
5,Cant fault this tablet for its price. The specs compare to the big grands but a fifth of the cost. The speaker is awful which I don't need. Perfect for work use
5,It's not the fastest PC around but it works really well with Office and my own (really big) apps. The full size USB is very useful. Great value for the money.
5,like everything about itreally pleased
5,Basically does everything a Windows surface does for half the price.
5,The tablet is perfect it isn't a top tablet but for this price you can buy a good tablet that permit you everything that a normal pc do.
5,Purchased for working on the move a very capable tablet with impressive battery life and the capability of a full size PC.Does everything I expected with ease.
5,Arrived on time . It’s fast responsive but one thing is a bit difficult to bring up the keyboard. Apart  from that excellent tablet. I can highly recommend that.
5,Light and simple to use works well. Very fast compared to othertablets l have had in the past.
5,This tablet does everything I need it to and more. It is reliable fast and a great size. For the price there's nothing better.
5,100% "Fast delivery" less 24h
5,Arrived as promised. good quality tablet. Impressed by feel.Set up very easily. Good battery life very responsive good memory. Very good service. I would recommend buying the docking station https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B018GM7HDG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
5,Much better than my IPad and a quarter of the price great tablet for meetings with keyboard case. Small size so much easier to carry than a laptop
5,No problem
5,Very impressed with the product. Quick delivery.  Very convenient as an addition to my desktop for home use.
5,Product: met all my exoectations; worked in car as a passenger on a 2 hour journey meaning no wasted time!Delivery: received product very speedily packaged wellLove it. Thankyou
1,It can barely run the preinstalled version of windows screen has a horrible feel to it almost no sound even at max volume struggles to connect even when placed on top of the router.
2,The touchscreen had alot of "dead" areas things wouldn't get selected or something nearby would instead. I have returned it to Fusion5 and waiting on them to fix/resolve the issue. If they can't then it will be fully returned.
5,It does what it says on the tin  as the saying goes what more can you ask for.
1,Too slow for my needs - running an android emulator. The touchscreen was not very responsive. I might have persisted but it wouldn't boot up on the second day despite being charged. I would not recommend.
5,Used for home  including shopping-games and e-mails.
5,Love it. Just what i wanted
5,Great value for money. Great features and easy to use.
5,This came early and it’s been set up for my grandson for Christmas looks great value for money can’t wait to give it to him on Christmas Dat
5,Next day delivery great tablet
5,It brilliant PC-tablet very fast network connection and long battery life performance which very good and I use office it for work it excellent tablet thank.
1,Audio drivers could not be reinstalled from windows intel Fusion5 ( Fusion5 offer no driver downloads ) or by resetting the tablet. Audio volume is so low you can't hear anything unless sitting in total silence. Touch screen is unreliable and apps slow to open ( you have no idea if the app is just slow or if you have to tap the screen again ) some apps such as speech recognition just freeze up
5,needed a new tablet for work. this meets all my needs
5,Purchased this product for work which it copes with well only slight drawback is screen in bright sunlight is difficult to see
5,For general use this is a nice convenient and high quality product. Just what I wanted. The sound is a bit quiet though.
5,Just as described easy to use. Neat and slimline easy to carry around.
5,Great value. Easy to set up and use. because it is Windows based works well with our other devices. Would recommend this product.
5,A great Windows 10 tabletclearvalue for money and just as good as a desk top model
5,Bought as gift for my partner who is extremely happy with its performance and services provided by
5,Clear screen and easy to use.  Good value for money and is a compact device.
5,I liked being able to install office 365 on windows 10 on this tablet
5,Just what my husband needed to play his games
2,Sadly the machine failed to work subsequent to it updating the software and was returned for refunding.A great pity it looked a well made bit of kit.
5,Excellent tablet Windows 10 works well a brilliant alternative to the main pc and at unbelievable price.
1,This product was faulty that it was returned within 24 hours and I was refunded my money.I will not try to purchase one of these items or the brand again
5,This a very good Windows 10 tablet light and easy to setup and use.
5,Quite a tidy little computer. Great for watching Netflix Sky Go etc.
1,Product did not work. Despite returning this item a month ago still have not received a refund despite company contacting me to say they had recieved return and asking if I wanted a replacement or a refund. A case of a company holding on to your money for as long as they can. To be avoided.
5,Good Windows tablet easy to use.  Long battery life.
1,It's absolutely awful. Doesn't do anything I want it to. Battery life is virtually non-existent. sound quality is ...ugh!Please don't buy this if you are expecting Microsoft to be intelligent and logical because this comes a very poor fifth place. it is dreadful. Animations go back to at least four years ago. I am appalled .
5,A fab tablet that more then meets my needs. Lightweight and very easy to use.
5,Very pleased with this product. Has excellent clarity and quality. Can thoroughly recommend.
1,This is my second one as the first did not switch on after a few weeks. I thought this second one was working better but after a few months it too will not switch on. I bought this for travelling and have not used it due to the lockdown.  Now I can't. Don't buy!
5,Bought this tablet for my wife and she loves it. Easy to use and good battery life.
5,You can do everything you can think of in a full size PC. Lovely little PC.
5,This tablet is great value for money.
2,It is very slow
1,Terrible product.. The sound quality is extremely poor can't hear anything unless listening with sound cancelling headphones.To fully charge the battery takes approximately 15 hours and this is by design. I sent this away thinking it was a fault but they advised there was no fault.Big waste of money.
5,Great spec for the price. I got tablet and keyboard case- very pleased so far
5,Great Product enjoying it so far!
5,Nice windows tablet at a good price.
5,Good tablet for the price. Only sound quality of speakers could be better. Recommended item.

5,Recieved item on time and easy to set upNot so easy to register item.
5,well worth the money exactly what it says with windows 10
5,Arrived promptly and is working correctly
1,have brought both types of these for presents after trying them finding that windows take up so much space to operate did not give as presents but gave to a charity shop sorry would noy recommend them to anyone
5,Prompt service a nice lightweight tablet.
1,Awful tablet. Incredibly slow. Sound quality awful. I went for this based on the many five star reviews but really can't see where they were coming from. Feels like a waste of quite a lot of money. Avoid!
5,Recently purchased and very happy with the product. Amazing value for money.
5,Compact and lightweight
5,Very nice
2,Hated it did not perform as well as expected.
1,I can't find how to get in contact with u.  My fusion 5 won't charge...  if i hold the charger in its charges for a while but as soon as I let go. it stops charging.  Please get incontact...
2,Touch Screen is crap need to touch icon twice for it to work at times.
5,Pros: Best budget you can find.Disadvantage: Sound's volume too low
1,Would have returned if I hadn't gotten locked out of my account.This is a terrible tablet freezes slow touchscreen terrible (not responsive)Do not buy this tablet
5,Good tablet with Windows 10 built in good value for money
5,Good quality and build
1,I received the Tablet PC a day early. Charged the battery and switched on the Tablet. Blue screen indicating an error with  code plus a scan code appear suddenly it goes into Preparing Automatic Repair and freez! This should not happen. Why is this?
1,These tablets simply can’t run Windows 10 and be used to do anything at all. They’re simply put too far behind in their tech and current spec.
5,Son very happy with product
5,Bought this for playing online browser mmorpgs
1,AWFUL DO NOT BUY STOPPED WORKING AFTER 4 MONTHS OF VERY LITTLE USE. UNABLE TO RETURN AS AMAZON SAY ITS TOO LATE. I'M ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED
5,Good product. Quick delivery. Very helpful online chat function

1,This Product is not worth the money hardly used the laptop as the sound quality required headphones & the Battery lasts 17min not so great for a hand held...
5,Easy to set up and use
5,Amazing and a great price thanks
1,Returned because had a password. As soon as I started up told me I had put in the wrong password and I read the book which said nothing about passwords.
1,Save your money and buy something else to slow frozen constantly.Reading the reviews it seems they bought a different product or they're just trolls
5,Great
5,great for what i use it for
5,Great parameters but the design needs improvement
1,Slow to use. Windows 10 does not work as expected on this everything is VERY slow. Going to send this back and buy an Amazon Fire instead.
