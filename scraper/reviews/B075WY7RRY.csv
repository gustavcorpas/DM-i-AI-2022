5,Hey it works when u trying to complete the rainbow! Every chick new pic!!!
5,The paper fits perfectly and the color is good comes in multiple packs so theres a lot of paper in there. Worth the money in my opinion glad I got it!
5,Product came early and as described. Thank you
5,A little pricey for only 50 tiny sheets of paper.
4,the first picture i got buy the wrong one the second picture i have to buy when i am going to buy the write one
5,Great price and great quality
4,Very good camera for my 7 year old! Good quality prints pictures are decent quality they’re better with bright lighting.
5,The Picture comes out amazing. It is really good quality & is worth the price. The app is very easy to use and is easy to select & print out a bunch of pictures.
4,Not needed  returning camera.  But Very small picture.  Not impressed
5,A great value for the amount of photo paper in this set.And the packs separated inside the box help keep everything organized.
5,For on the go printing
5,Pics are amazing  super cute easy to reload
5,My nephew loves this things
5,Really great product
4,After a week of research between the different brands models within each brand and cost for films. This one was the perfect choice! I am spending $0.50 per photo for one. Which is great compared to the well popular Instant Print Cameras out that would cost a $1.00 per print. The multiple features this camera contains was the seal on the deal. You are not forced to snap and print each photos like other and you can print photos that were never taken with the camera. You have to check it out!
4,The papers kept getting stuck in the printer
5,I’m using it for pictures for a scrapbooks
4,i got the wrong ones for mine. but my friend said that they were good
4,I didn’t know I had to use the blue paper that came with it because the print starting looking weird and I thought my printer messed up bad… but you put the blue paper upside down so it cleans the printer… but besides that it looks great
3,I bought this paper to use with the Kodak Step Camera.  I used the paper that came with the camera and I used part of one of these packs of paper that I bought separately.  And all images I took were awful!  All inside with super bright lighting. Color Black & White or Sepia Tone all images were terrible.  Because I used 2 packs from 2 different sources I believe the paper is probably fine but the camera not good. So I gave the paper a medium review because I never actually saw a good image come from that camera.
5,This comes with so much stuff and I love it!  My husband bought me the Kodak Smile camera for Valentine's Day last year and this year I wanted to get some accessories for it.  We just had a baby so the little photo album will be perfect for putting photos of her in it!  The case for the camera is a little snug but still works.  I also love all of the different frames for the photos!  Only downside with the frames is they don't stick well to the photo paper itself but that would be a problem of the manufacturer for the frames not this place.  If you have one of these cameras I highly recommend getting this kit!
5,PHOTO SCRAP BOOK
5,just make sure your camera meets the measurements and requirements needed for this particular kit. Other than that it worked. Perfect!
3,Pictures always have a red look to them
3,Say I bought this as a gift for someone. Its easy to set up and printing. I tell you the picture quietly came out like an SD television with the knob on it. But if you want to print memories on the go just to say look. This is a good starter printer.
4,Very overpriced for cheap pictures
5,i loved the product  pricing is decent & it’s works and printing quality is so cute
3,Kind of yellow orange haze photos very dark.
5,Is a great product easy to use.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Quality is awesome
3,I bought a Kodak printomatic camera for a road trip along with a 50 pack of the photo paper. The good - these little pictures are a lot of fun and the instant gratification of having a little picture come right out of the camera is neat. My 25 year old daughter in particular was enamored & asked to borrow the camera to take to Florida for a trip with her group of friends.I like to journal vacations so the little pictures were great for that process.The bad - the picture quality is mediocre at best and the color is generally not even close to true. I took a picture of my puppy on a brown couch at our rental house & it looks red in at least one of the pictures. The pics tend to be washed out. If you want high quality prints as opposed to a novelty sticker picture use a different set up.I'm not unhappy with the purchase because it does basically what I expected. I think it will be especially fun on a road trip which was what we were planning when we bought it. The Delta variant put an end to that so we ended up renting a house instead. Next year...
5,I am extremely happy with this purchase the picture quality is great the item is compact and I can take it everywhere with me the bundle it came with is amazing and has so many options to use to create an awesome and creative memory book I recommend it!
5,The quality is better than I expected. The app allows you to get creative and it prints it exactly how you style it. It work great with just any picture.
4,My daughter loved this gift!!! The awesome thing is we never have to buy ink!
5,Love it
5,Reminds me of when I was a preteen. They are very cool .Easy set up.
5,Image quality is fantastic looks like professionally developed pictures
5,I loved this product it was small it was perfect for what I wanted to do. If I had a bad day at work I’d come home and spend hours printing pictures and making a scrap book for my family since they are missing out on a huge part of my life. It was truly such a good way to space out for a bit and also remember the good times on a bad day. Printer quality depends on the photo. But overall it’s good. Sometimes the paper gets jammed easy to fix. Only thing I don’t like is how I only have access to the film online due to my base only selling name brand. But a cheaper better option. And they are like stickers so that’s super cool!
2,I printed photos from one of the packs and they all had the exact same line pattern - see the attached photo. (The 100 sheets come in 10 packs of 10 papers each.) I have used 3 other packs from this order without any problem. The return window is only 30 days - not enough time to use up 100 sheets of paper. So I'm stuck with at least 10% of my order being defective and no way to get a replacement pack. I hope the rest of the packs don't have this issue. If Amazon or Kodak will send me another pack I'll remove this review. The reason I gave the product 2 stars is because some of the packs have been fine.
5,Is really good
5,I have no dislikes. I really like it.
5,I bought 100 sheets so I didn’t have to pay for anymore for some time cause it’s hella expensive
5,The cartridge fit the camera and worked well the pictures were good.
4,Good because you can easily download the app and finally get prints immediately as they happen.easy to send photos from  phone. The pictures are small like a photo booth. I Should of picked a larger type.
4,Slight distortion of colors (with green or pink hue) and somewhat blurry but it's still great to be able to print pictures instantly from your phone. Accompanying app is very user-friendly as well.
5,it dose
5,The picture quality is just like any other pictures for this camera. I like that you could turn the photos into stickers. I bought this for my dad bc you can’t find these in stores anymore and I bought this for him last year for Father’s Day. The was a great value for the money. It was somewhat easy to use. It doesn’t come in a cartridge like other film does but rather you have to stick them in a certain way when loading them or you will mess them all up. My dad thought he could do it himself since he had done others in this camera before it and ruined a lot of the paper because the instructions are not to accurate or easy to read. Luckily it came with enough pic paper that I could save most of the pictures.
5,Great quality film. Pictures turned out great
5,Totalmente recomendable
5,Like
5,I believe they are happy with the purchase.
5,I liked my product
5,They worked for my printer
5,Simple to use happy with pics printed
4,Printer paper works like a pro but make sure you have decent lighting if you want a good picture!
5,Bought this to go with the printer for my 13 year olds birthday. They absolutely love it. I just wish the prints were a little cheaper but considering the quality and the love the product has. It’s worth it it brings me back to having prints to hand out to friends and notes/decorating walls and lockers with pictures of family friends and pets.Perfect size to decorate a clear cell phone case as well!!
4,The picture quality is not the sharpness you are used with Kodak. The pictures come out a little dulled but it still good. The backing comes off well but you have to bend the corner alittle to get it started. The pictures aren’t hot when they come out.
5,I have not used it as I said it was a GIF and they seemed very pleased with it
5,Nothing  I would buy again  !
5,For my granddaughter's birthday...she documented it well...pictures turned out very nice!
5,nice photo paper for the price
4,Buen papel y adhesivo puedes pegar y despegar pero solo recién colocado
5,Loved this product. Fits perfectly in my Polaroid and prints beautifully!
5,Use it for work love it!
5,Good film for what's intended.  Glossy finish. Love the sticky back. Easy to install. Made it dumb proof.
5,Bought this for our teen and she loved it.  Even printed off some pictures for my office.
4,The box was a little damaged and the printer paper itself didn’t have the best quality but overall it was pretty good
5,it is for my daugther she likes it.
1,So I can't tell if it's the quality of the print paper or is it the camera it's a Kodak camera. Or is it both. The photos have what was printed. I am thinking it's a waste of moneyAnd looking at the ads for the camera the photo shoot look great but the ones i got have are not very good at all look at the camera (KODAK Printomatic Digital Instant Print Camera) and you'll see what I'm talking about in the ad. Waste of money you know yeah
5,The product works great for the camera and easy to install.
4,We bought the 2 pack of 50 that equaled 100 sheets. First pack we only got 1 picture the rest came out blank. The second pack had no issues. I worked with Amazon and they gave me a partial refund. Very pleased overall
4,Love the portability. But the price....Sometimes prints are a little dark. Still really like though.
5,Great film
5,It’s a great present for kids but paper is expensive
5,El papel no es el problema si no las cámaras en las que se introduce el papel son de resolución extremadamente pobre
5,This is very easy to use and the price is good.
3,Who doesn’t like printer paper that is really stickers
5,Perfect thank you
5,Great
5,Me encanto
5,It was a good bye and the pictures are beautiful when they come out
5,It’s very good quality
3,The first package I tried to put in my smile printer jams it. I tried several times with the same output.
5,Easy to use.  Good quality.
3,Dislike the printing of pictures. Slightly yellow tints to them. Don't know if it's the Kodack Camara or film.
4,The quality of the photo isn't great especially towards the last few sheets in the printer. But its fun and it takes me back
4,I really like the fact that no toner or ink is required.  I would have liked to have a larger photo but for the money this is well worth the price
5,I wasn’t able to find this photo paper at any stores near me so I bought it online. It’s a pretty fair price it’s cheaper than my instax film. It arrived undamaged. I use it on my smile instant camera. If ya need it then this ones a good option and I think the cheapest one I found online.
5,Love it
5,Nothing I can say that was disappointing.  I am happy with the product.  I love the bundle costs appose just 1 box of 10.
4,I got this for my Kodak Smile instant camera and i blew through all the 20 sheets in a day. The quality is great but this paper is a bit expensive. 50 cents per print. I wish there was an alternative more affordable option.
5,The quality is good and they are simple to use.
5,qickness
3,The pictures don't turn out good at all.
4,For indoor photos flesh tones are slightly green.  Buy the newest Kodak printer.
3,Christmas gifts for grandkids but they cannot even use it until they buy a charger for it.
4,Works as advertised
3,Compré el kit con la impresora. La a fotos no salen tan claras siempre salen oscuras. Calibre la impresora varías veces les escribí para ver si había algún fallo pero nada resultó. Me sale práctico imprimir las fotos del álbum de recuerdos de los niños. Pero no quedan tan lindas como pensé.
5,Good quality
5,So awesome to have received sooner than initial delivery date!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Están bien traen 10 justo cómo lo dice y perfectos yo los pedí junto con la mini impresora y todo muy bien  fáciles de colocar 👍 solo que con la impresora que compre la resolución no es muy buena que digamos pero todo bien
5,My granddaughter luvs her Kodak Zink and only uses Kodak film so that's what I get her!
5,On time and what I expected
5,The paper is slightly smaller than a polaroid but I’m not complaining at all! :) I’m tickled pink that it has a sticky backing and I’m so excited to utilize that. I was more than happy with the picture quality and overall I’m really satisfied with what I paid for.
5,I ordered this item for my grandson . He likes the idea that he could make his own pictures at home.
5,I use these for quick pictures in my classroom. Just wish it wasn't so expensive.
3,The picture quality is good as far as clarity. For using no ink the color is decent it's overall a good photo but just lacking brightness and have more of a cyan tone to the photos rather than true to color.
3,Not sure if it was the paper the problem or the camera .
5,Very self-explanatory
4,Fun product just expensive
5,Picture quality is not perfect but just what I was looking for to add fun quick photos to the fridge
4,Picture quality is 4 outta 5. First picture came out great the rest were a little blurry. Price wasn't too bad. It came damaged not sure if it was shipped this way or if it was damaged in transit
1,I read the color comes from the paper which is why no color ink is needed.  Well the colors don’t change much.  I had to brighten the image and it still came out dark and dull like the original. Too bad it’s a great idea too. With the printer and extra paper the price was over $100. It had great reviews too which was why I bought it.  ☹️
5,Good
4,When I took my first photo with my Kodak PRINTOMATIC I was not impressed with the picture quality. There's something about its quality that is unsettling with me. Regardless of the quality I am fond of the compact picture size and the adhesive backing.
5,I chose the Kodak camera for my daughter because I just looked so much better.  It's great for a pre-teen/ teen to carry around in his/ her bag.  The film is at a fair price but is so fun to use and scrapbook with.
5,It’s a refill  they work  no complaints
5,Love the quality of the print paper
5,I am absolutely crazed that they actually have picture paper that has the ink already inside  goes with my zink printer  zink is zero ink.  Neat as all get out. I love this paper and my little zero ink printable printer.  These pictures also have a sticky side if you pull the paper off the back. You could stick them on your wall or place them in a book
5,It was exactly what I wanted. The print quality is great
4,These mask can used many times before you notice them wearing out. Does not suck in when you talk.
4,Initial impression is positive; I just hope it lasts.
5,Perfect for the small Kodak camera we bought it for!  Wish the papers were bigger but then the  camera would have to be bigger too then not as manageable!  Cute pics for “instant” could be more color detail & a bit distorted (fuzzy) but I think it’s too early to get instant great photos from any camera just yet. Still trying to prefect I’m sure.
5,Precious memories
5,We purchased this for our grandson who has an instant camera.  Although these do not produce high quality photos they are fun for instant photos and my grandson like them.
1,There is no option on the app to print stickers. I printed in collage format however the pictures did not develop. I tried 2 packs with the same result. Ver disappointing.
5,This film was a gift to my 9 yr old for Christmas. She loves to take pictures. For the price it was a great buy. Although the picture quality wasn't the best it was just fine for a 9 yr old.
4,Got it in a week and it does print high quality pics just not enough pages in there.
5,This is good quality I haven’t used it yet but it looks exactly like the used ones and they were good.
5,Great quality pictures.. these refills are great and the only printer paper my kodak mini printer will take .  I think it's cool that the ink is in the paper!!
3,I read the many positive reviews and was encouraged. The quality of the print was not great but it’s passable.
4,So when it comes to modern instant cameras there are basically two choices of format...Zink or Instax. In my opinion Instax photos generally look better. But Zink photos are faster (no "developing") have sticker backing and are quite a bit cheaper. My daughter wanted an instant camera for Christmas and the price of the film was a major factor for me when it came to deciding what kind of camera to go with.
5,I love this! It’s so cute and perfect for gifts! And the picture quality is amazing
5,Awesome product. Easy to use. Was wondering why so few prints in a pack but it’s how they fit inside camera. Already shot photos and they look great!!
4,Great product pictures come out looking sort of vintage my daughters love them.
5,They were exactly what I wanted! For the price there is a nice amount. They work with my camera beautifully
5,I love this printer! It’s so awesome I’ve sent cards with pictures and I love decorating pictures for friends and myself it’s totally worth the money
5,They were great in my camera pictures are clear happy with quality
5,Got it as a high school graduation gift. She was happy to start using it right away. Fast shipping solid packaging true to product description
5,The film comes in packs which is very convenient. The pictures quality isn’t amazing but it is decent. Beware of your lighting it can change the quality.
5,I LOVE this little printer. The ink on these pictures seem to stay pretty good.  I print these to add to my journal. Very Satisfied!!!
5,me agrado la calidad de las imágenes y la eficiencia y exactitud del equipo en el que he tenido la oportunidad de compartir recuerdos con mi familia y amigos
5,My son just got a ‘photomatic’ Kodak camera. It’s pretty easy to use but the pictures don’t come out all that well considering that you have to buy all this film.
5,Perfect size for making mini scrapbooks. I make a lot of them so this size it absolutely perfect. Love that they have adhesive to stick better
5,Exactly as described. Fast shipment as always
5,Bueno
5,The paper is a great value and super easy to use!  I’ve already gone through 3 packages of paper. The pictures are clear enough for what I’m looking for.
5,Great value works great.
5,This film is great quality. It provided what I needed. I was happy with the quality and clarity of the pictures. I recommend this film.
5,Everything I wanted in a printer
5,Bought these for our grand daughter who loves to take pictures.  I'm sure they will be fine as she uses this brand of photo paper all of the time.
5,It was AMAZING I had recently purchased the printer and I was very satisfied but I was a bit sad because it had no more prints but once I found a an affordable package and with a lot to offer I just couldn’t resist to get it.
5,I like it but i have a mailbox and i wrote call me before u leave it anyone could of taken it
1,I was so excited about this but it was a major disappointment. The pictures had lines through them and the colors were extremely faded. It got worse and worse the more I tried to print or edit the photos. And seriously who wants to edit every single picture before printing it so it doesn’t look AS bad? I read reviews of the other mini printers like this one made by different companies and it seems they all have the same problem with color and quality. I highly recommend using MPix online to print your photos. They’re cheap and extremely fast.
5,My granddaughter loves her Kodak Smile camera and this 2"x3" Premium Zink Photo Paper (50 Sheets) keeps her shooting her photos.  She loves it!
5,Good product for my printer.
5,Very good ink I love the part that it's a sticky picture an you can put it anywhere.
5,I'm obsessed with this printer and the fact that the paper is so cheap is incredible. great quality great price all-around super awesome.
5,I love that you just need to replace the paper and you don't have to buy any ink for the printer.
5,Love this paper and love that it can be a sticker or just a picture!! I'll be purchasing this again!!!
5,I love the quality and the functionality of the zinc paper but it is always a little pricey for the actual amount you get it. But because I like the convenience of having the Camera that allows me to take pictures and print them on the spot.
5,Works great as long as you put it in the camera correctly and let it print out the blue alignment paper before taking photos.  I love that it's also a sticker. Only downside is it's not very waterproof. My friend jumped in the pool and a single drop of water landed on the photo and smeared it a bit.
4,Perfect !
3,I use these with my Printomatic camera and they work like they are supposed to with the camera. They have sticky backs like a sticker which is a cool add-on and they look like decent pictures overall.
5,Price is good and I like to use Kodak in a Kodak printer.
5,Papel ideal para impresora kodak step
5,This product came just as advertised in a timely manner. I was more than satisfied.
5,Perfect
2,This was easy to set up and use however the quality of the pictures was not great. I had to make the image as light as possible even though the photo looked fine. The printed version was dark with blue tint. Probably won’t use very often and it’s too late to return it. 🙄
5,Great price fast delivery
5,I bought this to be able to share pics with the grandkids. They love it!!
1,Bad picture quality.
5,I ordered the wrong film it's too small for my mini printer. It didn't fit my Kodak mini 2 :(. It's entirely my fault I didn't know since my Kodak mini 2 is brand new. So make sure you know what size you are supposed to get. The shipping and packaging came exactly as it should (I paid additional shipping for it to arrive next day).
5,It’s film not much to say. Comes in 5 individual packs of 10.
5,These photographs are made instantly by a camera.
5,The pictures come out so vintage!
5,Great product. Good quality.
2,The pack of borders you can decorate your pictures with are entirely too large and pretty much useless. Pretty sad about it because they're so cute
5,Thank you for item! Fast delivery and good quality! Amazing packing!
5,Good price
2,picture quality was low and paper was pretty expensive. bought this for grandchild so he's having fun but for practical use-making lasting photos- not much good.
5,Me gusta el material y que se pueda pegar como un stiker.
5,I bought this for the Kodak smile instant camera and the pictures are great. The quality the speed of printing the shading everything very good.
5,👍🏼
5,I purchased this zink paper for my HP sprocket and it works much better!!! Photos come out with better color than the hp paper.  Just use the blue card from the hp paper to load the kodak paper and it works great!!!
5,Good gift but the quality is bad
5,Wonderful.
5,As described. Box of 5 stacks each containing 10 photo papers.
4,Great photo paper for our Canon Ivy. Was worried about compatibility but had no issues
5,This box of ZINK photo paper was part of an Amazon bundle deal in partnership with DBROTH. After the smartphone technology I have an OCD problem of wanting the right picture.  With 50 sheets I think it was worth it to add all the extra paper as the PRINTOMATIC camera only comes with 10 sheets.
5,I ordered this for the camera I bought my granddaughter.  I thought the price was  reasonable and delivery fast.  My granddaughter is pleased with the photo paper. It fits in her camera perfectly and produces great pictures. KAS
5,Bought as extra paper for the printer I purchased for my youngest daughter at Christmas. She loves the device so I am sure she likes this extra paper. Can't go wrong with this brand which is why I bought Kodak. Recommended
5,Works great in our HP Sprocket and prints consistently. What more could you want?
4,Happy with the product. I wish the photo was a little larger.
5,Everything
2,The picture is printed distorted and with some difference in color. Very different from what the description of the product promotes!
5,Made great points with this gift. However the camera has a bit of a quick trigger my grand girl used a lot of film before she figured this out. It will make for a great refill gift come May's bd.
1,it’s just horrible
5,A great value for a small price. This film was part of a package that went with the small zinc smile camera. It’s a perfect addition to the camera because the camera only comes with a small amount of instant film.
5,Love it. The quality of the picture isn’t all that great but that could easily be me 🤷🏾‍♀️ I still love it tho
5,quality and ease are great
5,My grandson loves taking pictures.
5,These are so cool and easy to use.
5,Was a gift and she loves it
5,Work great easy to put in.
5,Value for money
5,Can’t wait to open it up and use it for the rest of the holidays
5,worth the money we like to take lost of pictures
5,Got exactly what I was expecting.
5,Easy to use and good quality
5,excelente producto . me facino
5,Work just as described! I love these my pictures turn out so beautiful when printed on these.
5,Great photo quality. My wife loves it. Photos come out nice and clear when in the right lighting.
5,I love the sticky back
5,Love it
2,For some reason this smells so strongly like cigarette smoke it burns my nose.
5,Great quality paper and affordable!
4,Work well in our instant camera within limitations of firm factor - small size is main inhibitor to use but that is a camera lomititation not a fault in this product.
5,LOVE this picture paper.
4,Tiny tiny pieces for the price.  Quality could be better.
1,So great product and all maybe if you keep in a photo album but I put magnets on the back of these and every single one of them has warped in away for no reason. Just sad keep in photo album to solve problems .
3,Product as described individual film packets inside were undamaged however shipping envelope had been ripped open and retaped and boxes containing film were completely crushed
5,This product is awesome
5,Just ok
5,Nice and easy ti refill live the 10 pic packs
5,The kids love the gift. I would buy another
5,The best product I have purchased.  The pictures come out so clear.  Every time I have used the camera people want the pictures.  So I have given them the information on how to purchase the camera and film.
5,The picture quantity is not the best. But its better than most instant camera film. You get the whole picture and don’t have to deal with the white frame. And even when I miss the classic white instant camera photo look. I can just get the frames/ sleeves to put the pictures into.
5,Exactly what I needed.
5,I ordered these on a Friday by sunday they had arrived! (we have an amazon in our town)Two packs of 10 sheets are included (as ten fit in the camera at a time)if you have a kodak i highly recommend these sheets as their are convenient affordable and work perfectly.
5,It works good I love the picture printer too
5,So easy to use!
5,Im happy with that
5,Gift
5,As described
4,read directions and it works great will be buying more in near future for my daughter she loves it
5,Great
5,Calidad de imagen
5,Muy buen material y excelente calidad de Imagen
5,This product is exactly as advertised.
5,quick easy and looks great!
5,NICE
5,Price is right. Delivery as promised
1,Poor picture quality. Do not spend your money on this product.
4,Used to make a photo guest book for my wedding. The book came out beautifully. The self stick photo paper made it easy.
5,We love them
5,need more in the pack
5,My husband bought the Kodak Printomatic for me for my birthday at a local store but he purchased the wrong photo paper.  The store did not have the right paper so I finally turned to Amazon and it was exactly what I needed.
5,Love these pictures!
5,I buy this over and over again for my mint printer
5,they make the zink film for kodak polaroid ect. buy a zink film camera the odds are the both the camera and film are made by this company.
5,We purchased this film for a senior citizen friend who needed the film for a camera that she had.  She was very impressed with the print quality and how clear the picture was.  We will probably be ordering more for her...thanks again!
5,Daughter loves this!!!
5,A very nice picture quality
5,Really good
5,Love this stuff
5,Great gift
5,These items are print paper re-fills for our recently purchased Kodak Instant Print camera.  The items were as described and the price was slightly cheaper than from the OEM.  Fast delivery we had them within 2 days of ordering.
5,You have to know that these ZINK papers are not going to be lab quality photo prints. But for fun instant prints in social gatherings they are a blast. Plus they can be stickers!  These work in the Polaroid Snap cameras as well as the Kodak Printomatic.  Paper was made in USA.
3,Smaller than I thought they would be
5,very happy with purchase
4,Good value
5,I didn't even know they were stickers lmao ya.
5,Love
1,Never had an issue with my printer using Polaroid paper these are bowed new in box and my printer only would function with one sheet inside then the image has a line on the edge with a color variation thanks a lot my dog died and I wanted to print some pics but guess not.
5,I volunteer at a elementary school in the first grade.  I used it to take pics of the kids to put on their book boxes.  It makes it easier to find their book box and they love the pics.
5,To start a scrape of memory pics. Picture came out great.
1,The camera these goes with really sucks so these are not worth the money. You will waste pictures trying to figure out how to center a photo because the camera does not take the picture centered. The quality is low. They advertise that you need to use bright colors to get the full quality of a photo. I used crayons colors and it looks like I took photos in a dungeon. There's also a blue and yellow streak that has run along all of my photos so far. Not sure if that's the paper or the camera. Do not buy!
1,After multiple packs tossed in the towel on this one.
5,Good
3,Not as great as I expected
4,It was a fast delivery it's a present for my grandson it looks good.
4,The kids have fun taking pictures. Not the best quality pics but fun.
5,I like these because they're cheaper than Polaroid film and are a higher quality picture. Plus being able to choose between color and B&W is a cool feature.
5,My daughter loves this quick process camera photos
5,Brought this for my daughter she loves it
5,It’s photo paper. It does exactly what you think photo paper would do. The end.
5,Daughter loves the pictures that this prints instantly if she's happy good enough for me.
4,Works as indicated but inside colors are not true colors But that could be the Kodak camera.
5,Amazing quality
4,Good
2,This camera is the perfect size and the quality of the pictures/printing are just fine for the camera's intended use.  However within two days of use (and only two packages of film) the camera jammed during printing and we have been unable to remove the jammed print paper.  Two very small screws inside the film compartment appear to be the way inside the camera but it does not come apart without 'prying' and risking further damage to the camera.  The camera is not usable and will need to be returned or taken in for repair.  Disappointing purchase.
3,Photos look faded & old. Even when printing a high-resolution SLR photo the photo looks low resolution.
5,If ya gots tha camera ya gots ta have tha paper.
5,These are for my kids and their cameras. They love it because they can take pictures. They are easy to use and the pictures come out great!
3,I was expecting the prints to come out larger than what they are. hey are really small like minis in comparison to the Instax mini for instance. Quality is horrible to that it's supposed to be great but the color is barely there.
5,Effortless dry prints good quality. Easy to use and load. A good buy.
4,i gave it a 3 because i wish there was more film came in time good packaging
2,They work fine but aren't amazing. Most Polaroids come out with cleaner images than these do.
4,These little prints are fun but a little on the expensive side.
1,Broke after one print. Printer always says there is a jam or out of paper when there isn’t. Troubleshooting did not fix problem.
5,Used to take little pics for an application that needed a picture
5,Film arrived packaged perfect. It's a great stocking stuffer and my teenager loves having her pictures immediately! It reminds me of the old 1980s Polaroid days !
5,Bought for my Granddaughter at Christmas. She loves them.
5,The price is great and it comes with two pack in the package
5,Great color and clarity. I was surprised at the quality and ordered more the first time I tried it!
4,More universal options for portable photo printer
5,Easy to use and makes for adorable photos
5,You need it if you want to use your camera ;)
5,Great product and easy to use the color isn't quite there otherwise great product.
5,great value for the money count be more pleased.
5,Value for money—> 100Greatness —>100Quality—>100
5,great product
5,The resolution isnt the best but I do love the quickness of the print with the photos. I love my Camera.
2,The paper is pretty small and the images do not come out the best quality but it is manageable. For the price I don't think it's worth it. Comes with few very small papers. Not worth it.
5,These are perfect for my sprocket
2,When I received this item it had already been opened and there had been two picture cards already used. Very disappointed that it wasn’t an unopened item.
3,The film is supposed to adjust the color to correctness.  Not so much pictures come put with a pink ting. And when you center the camera pn the object picture comes out off part cut off off center.  Both not good.
5,Ordered for a gift with a camera
5,The film fit and worked like it was suppose to. Had no problem using the film. Would definitely buy again.
4,Items were gifts to granddaughter for her camera
5,Must buy
5,My 6 years old Grandson opened this for Christmas and he yelled out Jackpot! He loves it and so did his older cousins!
1,When we received our package the box Kodak sent had been open slightly and 10 sheets were missing (sheets are packaged individually in sets of 10 and we only got 4 sets). For the price you pay for these sheets not getting 20% of them is kind of a big deal.
1,The photos looked yellowish in color blurry and over exposed.  I wrote Kodak and they said to run the color card through a few times.  That didn’t work.  Stay away from this printer.
3,It’s 🦆
1,In all lighting... I could not get a clear picture. This film and the camera are junk.
4,Daughter is pleased
5,works great.  takes great pictures
1,Dislike the fact that the printer runs out of ink and ink can't be added.  The pack of paper that came with the printer is all that was needed since the printer ran out of ink.  The printer doesn't work so the extra paper wasn't necessary.
5,Very good
5,My wife enjoys covering our home with pictures of the baby but the refills are a little pricey.
5,Bought this with the Kodak smile pictures are great
1,Pictures come out awful! Looking into another brand heard if you keep the original color calibration sheet that you can use other brands. Will be looking into Canon because this is unacceptable. Will return.
5,It worked as stated easy to use and with the SD card you still have digital pictures. Wife loves it.
1,The photos (when it worked) perpetually had a pink hue. Do not buy Kodak.
1,Does not work in Polaroid cameras that use Zink paper.
5,Worked well although the first one developed a weird white line through it. But it wasn't a big deal.
5,same as came with camera
5,Just like came with camera
4,Just what we wanted
5,Worked perfect for our wedding guest book. 2 months later after flipping through pages multiple times and these still stick!
5,Love these little photos! Great instant shots I use on clear plastic shoeboxes! Perfect color!
5,Works great just as described!
5,I like it not perfect just ok
5,We use this camera/film to take photos of shipments that come to our warehouse damaged. Works great.
1,Don't buy
5,Good quality for the cost
5,These pictures are kind of a silly thing. Not practical but great for a kid to play with.
5,We bought this to go with the camera for a birthday present for our 13-yr-old granddaughter.  No problems a good product.
5,The ease and compact of usage.
5,It was ok I seen better
2,The product box came in damaged. I bought as part of a gift and I have no idea if the actual sheets are ok or still use able.
1,Bought the wrong thing & can't return it because it was after 30 days before our daughter opened it.
5,It's fun to take these pictures and to print them
4,No problem.
4,Great product
5,Photos came out great for my granddaughters bridal shower.
5,Works well
5,Works great 👍
5,Love that the individually-wrapped film packages come with instructions so I can have others load it without providing instructions myself. Great product.
5,So cute. They stick. Nicely but you gotta stick them or they curl up after a few days lol
4,Great pictures
1,The colors are really bad. Cannot take pic in sunshine at all. Washes out skin. Also is a nightmare to peel paper off to attach photos. I wish they had a corner that peeled off easily. I take many pictures with this camera cause I have a B&B and everyone signs my book and I put their instant photo on their page. I will look for another camera/film that does better. People don’t  like the job it does on their faces. Bad quality.  I’m a wedding photographer so maybe I’m too critical. The reason I use this is cause I need an instant photo.
5,Great buy
5,Good product
4,Ok
5,Good product!
5,Great product
3,i thought it would be perfect in pictures though it is a little faded but it works great love these..😊
5,Works great.
3,I think it’s not enough for the money
5,love it
5,Very happy with the product. Works great in our Mini Shot.
5,It's cool
5,easy to use and plenty of pictures to print outcomes in 10 pks
1,Don’t waste your money
2,picture not clear
5,Really neat tech. No ink instant pics that are stickers.
5,as described
5,Good pics
5,As expected
5,Got for my gf she likes it
5,Great product great price
1,This camera stopped working the day it arrived. First the cards kept getting stuck then the back would not close all the way and then the cards kept falling off. Finally it gave in altogether within the week. We were traveling so we missed the return window but I'd like to return it.
5,Good price and easy to use.
5,I liked it  but should be slightly cheaper
1,I TOOK A PIC OF OUR DOG INSIDE AND AND USED THE CAMERA TO TAKE A SELFIE AS TGE DIRECTIONS SAY TO DO SO WAS NOT HAPPY WITH THE COLORS OF THE PRINT OUT AND THE PHOTOS PRINT OUT SLOWLY!!
1,No idea if this is a good product as the camera that you use it in Kodak is a piece of junk !!No charger with it beyond difficult to load film and if you are lucky enough to get the camera to work u might get a picture to spit out after 20 mins !
3,They works good but to much expensive
5,Bought this product for my daughter. She loves it!
5,Fast service
2,Easy to install and use.
5,It was ok nice picture
5,Grandkids...small family get-togethers fun to use!
5,I like the camera this film works in.  I will buy again
1,When the printer is junk the paper is worthless
5,Love that this is a bigger pack.
5,Wish pic quality was better
1,No instructions
1,I like did not like that my package came a day late.I was mad then when i got it i was happy when i inserted them into my camera i was dissaponted.As you can see the picture is bad quality I took a bunch of pictures and you cant see anything.I am mad and expecting good quality do not buy.
5,Expensive but fun
5,Great price for the film
1,Its keeps jamming my printer
2,Not colorful pictures
5,Recommend fast delivery all is OK
1,We bought these cameras and the film for our vacation.  Only 1 in 4 of the film pages would actually work on either of the two different cameras we purchased.  This is a horrible product.  Such a disappointment.
1,Picture quality is too bad. It maybe has to do with my camera but I can’t imagine that any camera that uses this photo paper wouldn’t produce image similar to the images on the package.
1,Picture quality is lacking
1,We bought these for guests to use our wedding for the guestbook and they were terrible.  We ended up returning the camera that uses these as we know we’ll never use this film again. Most of the pictures turn out either blurry or grainy they are really difficult to use Most of the guests had to have help figuring out how to do them. I wish I could return these but that option is not being offered to me now. I would not recommend.
1,Had to return did not like the quality
3,give the photos a blue tint
5,Best value
5,El producto es el de la foto.
5,Work great and looks beautiful.
5,I like the size and color
3,I was not prepared for this to work as well as it did.
5,good price package came on time
1,I was very disappointed with The print quality.
5,Just what I wanted
5,Just what I needed to go with my instapik camera
2,The pictures are dark
5,Great value
5,Love how the photos come out!!
1,The film was just a waist of my money. very disappointing bc it didn’t work in my kodak Bluetooth portable printer. Which makes me very upset and unhappy with this
1,Missing carrying case photo album...only received the camera.
5,Works very well Easy to install and picture is very clear.
5,Exactly what I needed
5,Good product
5,Perfect for my purposes
5,Value was great.
5,Great color
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Item can opened and missing a pack of film
5,Good buy
5,Works great
5,Great product.
5,Excellent service n product. Thank u
5,Excelent
1,Don't waste your time on the Kodak camera. The photo quality is awful and very grainy. The Polaroid Hi-Print is a far superior option.
3,gift
5,Product as described shipped fast
3,Okay.
5,Really good product
5,Muy pegajoso
1,I'm not sure if it's the camera or the paper that caused it but I recently purchased the film and the camera for my daughter. After running about 10 photos through it a photo got stcu and crinkled up inside the printer. I haven't had it long. Hopefully I can get it replaced!
5,Exelent
1,For $.50 a print you would do much better just buying a better camera and getting Walmart or print them for $.09 a 4x6! These pics suck!
2,Easy to use but ultimately the photos do not look as advertised on box. I blame the camera as well but I would not buy this product again.
5,for a gift...hoping it's great!
1,I bought this for my daughter's brand new printomatic and it is not working at all. I'm not sure if it's the camera or the paper
2,Looks like pictures printed from chuckie cheese ride..
1,Ordered one as a Christmas gift. On Christmas day realized it didn't have a power cord. Ordered a replacement it didn't have one either.
5,Nice retro feel!
5,Good
5,Fun
5,Very good quality.
1,Didn’t work from the start
5,GreatProduct.
5,Great quality and great value
1,Blurry washed out pictures.
1,the picture quality was not great
1,Not sure if it’s the photo paper or Kodak camera but the end result is heavily blue tinted and blurry. I cannot recommend.
1,Did not fit in kodak short shot
1,Never buy
1,awful  very small............not even been credited
1,Picture quality and color is not any better than Polaroids of 40 years ago!! Another flop from a once creative company but one that has been on the way to graveyard since digitization.
1,No recibí este producto aun cuando se pago dinero adicional para ser recibido en los dos siguientes días por favor tramitar el reembolso del dinero. Gracias
1,This camera is kinda fun but the picture quality is really poor.  i stopped using it...there is still film in it.  Goodwill item
2,Terrible coloringand not sharp.
1,I can’t get to my film. The delivery instructions were not followedI’d rate higher if I had my film
1,A Xmas gift wrap and under the tree will let you know after Xmas.
1,Didn't work in the camera. Positively useless because the camera is positively useless. It all went back for refund.
1,The envelope showed up I took it directly from a driver and the photo paper was not in the package. This is unacceptable.
1,Quality of pictures are horrible.
1,The camera and the pictures are not even as good as very early instant Polaroids.  Big waste of money
1,wrong
1,colors are not realistic
4,I hope no one purchased the pack of 50 for 24.99If you buy 3 of the 7.99 you get 60 sheet for the same price 🙄🙄
5,Good quality great colors
5,Solution tos instant photos
5,Purchased in a pack for my Kodak camera so I wouldn't run out. It's very easy to accidentally snap a way more pictures than you planned!
5,Wow it's cheaper to buy 3 20 packs and get 10 extra vs buying the 50 pack. That's pathetic.
5,Gives that vintage look and prints quickly
3,It's a gift
5,Great product
5,My daughter got one of these cameras for her birthday and needed some photo paper the quality is what you would expect from a instaprint camera. (Not great) but they love them. The nice surprise was this photo paper has a sticky back you can remove the back and stick your picture anywhere. My daughter loved it.
5,Great for young photographers and scrapbooking
5,takes good pics
5,Works  great
5,Quality of the pictures are okay but It’s a good product you can do edits and even make the pictures come out without a border which I love
5,super nice very convenient!
5,Great
5,Great item
5,The picture quality is amazing
5,
5,Bought this photo paper with the printer and the photos come out pretty nice! It was a Christmas gift and so far is working well and we really like it. Would definitely recommend
5,Good
5,Nice quality and easy
5,Paper color could be better
5,Kodak 2"x3" Premium Zink Photo Paper work like they are supposed to so it gets 5 stars. The problem is the device we own makes everything look orange/brown. So while these are cool and fun to use the Kodiak printer quality is just not there.
5,Love these. I wish they were cheaper though
5,Muy buen compra
2,Polaroids in the 90's were better quality than these
5,Best quality
5,Great for what it is for love it
5,So I bought the camera and these Print sheets. Absolutely love it! The picture comes out blurry sometimes but that's just because the camera is sensitive. Awesome product for a teen!!
5,Nice for travel
5,💕
5,Will need to reorder soon!!!
5,Was a gift and is loved.
5,Good value
4,Bought it for my granddaughter and she picked it out knowing that it has to be a good product
5,Perfect
5,I found my little Kodak camera at a years sale and I’ve been trying to find the film for it. I came across this bundle set and was like that’s the one. You get film and plus a carry case and accessories for photos and a photo album. How cool is that!? I highly recommend this bundle set of you have the little Kodak insta pic camera!
5,I have a Kodak Step instant camera. The film not really cheap but this is only one I can find that it takes! I use sparingly:) I also have Kodak Step mini printer those pictures come out much better with this film! ;)
5,It is perfect!!
5,Good
5,Good quality photos Reasonable price.
5,Great deal for my money
5,Do not buy if you do not have a KODAK step zink printer. These are needed to properly prink from the kodak printer. KEEP THE BLUE CARD for each packet.
1,To high the pictures were blurry
5,De buena calidad pequeña
5,Used for pictures
3,2 stars
5,These are eh
5,Must have when ordering camera.
5,These are by far the cheapest prints available I could find and they work amazing. I would highly recommend them and the back is a STICKER! They stick to whatever you put them on for so long I haven’t had one come off my wall yet.
5,I use these with my canon ivy. Good paper but I think I'll stop buying them bc they're a little warmer than the canon branded paper. It's easier to remember how to edit photos in the app when I can remember what paper I'm working with. Literally nothing wrong with the paper; just a matter of preference depending on which printer you're using and how the app translates the color on the screen to the printer.
5,Perfect 👍
5,This worked perfectly for me to provide all that my Grand Daughter needed to get started taking and printing her own photos.  I purchase the recommended set of Printomatic Digital Camera the Kodak Zink Photo Paper and a Hard carry case.  The paper is the finishing touch to a great gift of great photos!  Amazon pricing makes it even better!!!!
4,It has two refills for the camera in it. Its expensive so try not to waste it with bad pics
5,It’s the perfect starter kit!
5,Been doing photography for 48 years. Very convenient. Photos when they come out are as good when I use to develop and enlarge my own 8x10s
5,Like that the photos are stickers and that I can print them whenand where I want
5,I ordered the wrong size film
5,gift
5,Wish you would get more paper but it’s worth it for the price
5,Bought kodak paper for a kodak camera wish it was as cheap as the cannon paper though.
5,you get what you pay for these things are cool
5,Came with the correct quantity
5,Muy bueno
5,Good picture quality
4,Picturs come out a little white but that could just be the camera donr know yet until I try on different film
5,Great quality and fast delivery
5,2 pack of 10 eachCannot best it
5,as described
5,This was a gift but seems to be of good quality
5,Bought as Christmas gift for our granddaughter. Works great. Good quality. Little pricey. Fast shipment.
1,Every pic comes out with a green color and doesn't center right!
5,I would definitely  buy this product  again for my family function good quality pictures.
5,Parfait pour mon appareil
4,Prodotto come da descrizione  peccato che la confezione fosse un pochino rovinata (era per un regalo)ma non avevo il tempo per fare il reso
5,Es la mejor opción de papel ZINK Polaroid ya que ronda otro modelo pero de caja blanca el cual tiene un precio más elevado y realmente es el mismo producto. Yo adquirí este por $180 MXN y el de caja blanca está en $278. He comprado ambos (primero el de caja blanca antes de que este estuviera disponible) y es el mismo articulo. Reseña escrita el 23 de octubre 2020.
2,Livraison rapide paquet en bon état. Fonctionne comme prévu avec la caméra Printomatic. Prix économique versus la compétition. C'est tout ce qu'il y a comme points positifs. Le rendu est très décevant. Je ne recommande pas.
4,no carrying case and on the good side is that  it takes decent instant images as we know it does
5,Hay que saber ocupar bien la cámara para que las fotos salgan bien y el papel se convierte en una estampa lo cual me encanto.
5,Me gustó el tamaño y la calidad de la fotografía. Además es muy facil cargar el cartucho a la camara.
5,Compatibles con el moto mod Polaroid. 100% recomendable
5,bien
5,Gift for my daughter also got her the portable printer
5,Un buen producto papel de calidad funciona Perfecto con la impresora.
4,Good product
5,Je suis très satisfaits merci beaucoup.
5,This paper is built to last. Some of the photos that I printed a while back still look good as new. In addition it really makes the whole reloading process much easier as all you need is the paper and nothing more.
5,It's so nice that all I have to do is load this paper without the need of any cartridges or toner. It really speeds up the process while at the same time doesn't hinge on the quality that it produces.
2,There's a red tinge to it
5,They work perfectly and arrived very quickly.
5,Buen producto para las cámaras instantaneas.No he tenido ningun detalle con el producto.
1,Photo ne sort pas claire brouille rougeâtre
5,Kodak sticky backed photo paper helps create some very high quality prints. The sticky back is an added bonus.
5,Ma commande est arrivée le jour d’après et en excellent état. Je le recommande à tous. :)
5,Excelente calidad.
5,Muy buena calidad
5,Un poco caro pero buen papel
4,Llegó antes de tiempo y todo ok...
5,On Time!!
5,parfait
5,Prodotto estremamente utile e buono. Consigliato
5,Compré el papel para la camara kodak step y funciona perfecto
5,Ok
5,La qualità è davvero buona
5,Originali…veloce ottimo
5,SENCILLO DE PONER Y DA UNA CALIDAD ALUCINANTE ADEMAS LAS FOTOS SON PEGATINAS
5,
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Weil gerne danach gefragt wird: dieses ZINK-Photopapier passt auch in den Polaroid ZIP-Drucker. 2x3 haut von der Größe her wunderbar hin.Als etwas günstigere Alternative zum Originalprodukt durchaus zu empfehlen!Qualitativ sind die Ausdrucke auch OK. Ist halt für "zwischendurch" gedacht. High-End-Drucke erreicht man da sowieso nicht.
5,Fácil de colocar y el material muy bueno. Y lo mejor son autoadhesivos. Recomendado.
4,Mucho
4,Fonctionne parfaitement avec mon appareilBien laisser les films dans l’obscurité le plus longtemps possible pour un meilleur résultat!
5,Perfetta
3,Io ho una stampate HUAWEI mini e questo tipo di carta non va bene. Stampa ma i colori tendono tutti al verde. È comunque la stampante mi ha segnalato che la carta era inadatta anche poi la foto le stampa
5,Passen super
3,Le.foto non sono belle qualità bassa e pochi fogli dovrebbero costare la metà.
4,Bonne carte bonne qualité. Un peu cher mais la qualité est présente.
3,Bien bin produit mais cher
5,Love these
4,Ich habe bei meiner letzten Bestellung leider nur 20 Blätter bekommen statt 80 dienlich bestellt hatte . 😡😡😡
5,Value for money and excellent quality
5,Ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo.
4,Qualità-prezzo un po’ alta 20 foto costano 13€ foto un po’ sgranate (forse non sono bravo io a scattare le foto)
5,I very good paper quality
5,Ottimo acquisto e prodotto
5,No hay pegas en productos kodak
2,Qualité médiocre et prix excessifFranchement Kodak vous êtes à combien de marge?
5,Ottima  per catturare bei ricordi
3,I compared this to cheap no name ones and the price you pay is not worth it.
4,Macht riesigen Spass besonders wenn meine Enkelkinder  Bilder machen.Na ja druckgualität ist nicht der beste.
5,It does what its supposed to do
4,Auf Dauer zu teuer und Druck Qualität ist nicht die beste.
5,Ho messo 5 stelle per la fiducia. È stato un regalo
4,Avevo dubbio se serviva per la mia stampante polaroid è perfetta per la stampante. Ottima qualità
3,Prodotto conforme alle caratteristiche indicate. Consegna come sempre puntuale
3,Je trouve cher pour le nombre de feuilles.
5,buona la carta x foto
5,prodotto davvero ottimo mia nipote si ci sta davvero divertendo
3,Kann zur Qualität kaum etwas schlechtes sagen. Die Bilder sind kommen super heraus und sind direkt entwickelt.Leider ist der Preis sehr hoch.
5,Senza lode e senza infamia. Ricariche per macchina Kodak
3,Schnelle Lieferung- finde den Preis sehr überteuert und die Bildqualität nicht so toll.
5,L’istantanea
5,Ottima ma abbastanza costosa.. purtroppo!
5,Great value and easy to use
5,Ottimo compromesso l'acquisto per prezzo e soddisfazione del cliente
5,Très bon rapport qualité prix
5,Ottimo prodotto
1,Ahimè mi unisco al coro di quelli delusi. Ho acquistato la carta contestualmente alla fotocamera. Ho avuto fiducia che il problema fossi io per le prime 10 foto. Poi con le successive 10 ho dato la colpa ad una partita di carta (magari) vecchia. Con le successive 20 foto mi son detto che la giornata era buia e per questo le foto venivano scure. Poi ho lasciato perdere la fotocamera (sensore da 13 mp davvero scarso) ed ho stampato foto che sul telefono risultavano bellissime su qeusta carta: risultato pessimo. Spesso vengono righe (strisciate) orizzontali o verticali ed i colori (ottenuti per impressione sulla carta) fanno davvero pietà. Le foto del prodotto sono assolutamente ingannevoli. Restituirò tutto.
5,Einfach gute Bilder aber nur bei Tageslicht
5,Perfecto hace su funcion y kodak ya es garantia de por si
4,Buena calidad marca de confianza.
5,Perfetto
3,Disappointed with quality. Prints lack definition and tend to be on the orange side. Given the price and Kodak brand I was expecting more from both this paper and the camera.
5,Sono di buona qualità le uso con la macchinetta kodak quindi alta compatibilità.Il prezzo è buono rispetto ai negozi.
5,Carta fotografica molto buona.solo il prezzo è un po’ troppo alto
2,Salen tan caros los papeles para foto que no merece la pena comprar la cámara
5,Würde zusammen mit der Kamera gekauft. Hat eine gute Qualität und macht super Bilder
2,I used the to print photos
3,Articolo conforme alla descrizione.
5,bonjourje suis assez contente du résultat de mes photos en noir et blanc quelques traces en couleur très bien
5,Qualità di stampa non il massimo
5,van perfect para la insta
4,Great for little prints of photos. Just a little pricey for what they are
5,Good  product
5,Macht was es soll
5,The camera isn’t that great you can’t see what you have taken photos of and will only know when printed and as paper isn’t cheap it’s not great
2,Mi dispiace dirlo ma questi fogli per stampare in modo istantaneo non mi hanno affatto soddisfatto non sono assolutamente di buona qualità.Qualità di stampa pessima (questo potrebbe ad ogni modo essere correlato anche alla scarsa qualità della macchinetta fotografica) i pacchetti sono fatti malissimo i fogli infatti spesso cadono dopo che li apri o si storciono facilmente l'adesione invece è abbastanza buona (nella media) ma il rapporto qualità prezzo è davvero indecente...Costano davvero troppo è mai possibile che ad ogni stampa devo pagare quasi 70 centesimi?Una delusione davvero spero migliori
4,Buena calidad de imagen

1,Terrible quality would not recommend
4,El papel es muy bueno
3,Usata su una macchinetta della solita marca ma la qualità non è buona anzi...più sullo scarso ma non so se dipende dalla macchinetta o dalle foto. Comunque non sono entusiasto
5,Prese insieme alla macchina fotografica. E' stato un regalo molto apprezzato! Arrivato velocemente
1,Jamais réussi a avoir de "jolies" photos!Je ne m'attendais pas à une qualité géniale mais là..... on ne voit que des traits!Dommage....
3,No es para tirar cohetes dado a que las fotos no salen tan nitidas pero para el uso que se le da esta muy bien.
5,Love the quality of this paper it seems to be really glossy and the photos look very good quality unlike some other ones

1,Compre este papel de impresión para mi Polaroid Snaptouch que es papel de tipo Zink porque había leído en las preguntas de otros clientes y decían que era compatible pero la cámara me dice "solo se admite papel Zink" y nada que no imprime con este papel... Encima al haberlo abierto no puedo devolverlo pero tampoco puedo usarlo. Que pena!
5,My grandaughter loves them
5,Buen papel para la cámara a un precio razonable
5,Nada a dizer excepto que este papel também é autocolante.
5,Ho acquistato questa carta per le mie Sproket hp dal momento che ero rimasta senza carta.Nessun problema di compatibilità stampa perfetta ed ottima adesioneConsigliata ne acquisterò ancora 😁
5,Excellent product will purchase again
5,Pics Need to be taken with a lot of light otherwise colours Will not be very clear
5,Livraison ultra rapide. Bon rapport qualité prix.Papier de qualité dans un emballage adapté et pratique.Compatibilité avec les appareils Kodak Smile pour des tirages d'un bon rendu.
5,It was a gift for my grandson. He got a camera for Christmas as well as a scrapbook so he can make memories of his family and friends and his adventures
3,Nella media in linea con la macchina alla quale sono associate
5,La qualità di stampa è buona come il rapporto qualità-prezzo. L'adesione non saprei era un regalo
3,IL PRODOTTO è CARINO CERTO LE STAMPE NON è CHE SONO TUTTO QUESTO GRAN SPETTACOLO

5,I actually got this paper to go with this instant camera that I had been just gifted and it was perfect! I didn't know that there was paper that eliminated the need for things like cartridges and toner. It makes the camera so much easier to maintain!
5,La cartulina es pequeña está bien lo de la pegatina para pegar donde quieras.
5,Ottimo prodotto qualità kodak adesione buonissima. Perfetto per creare calamite da frigo con soggetti o paesaggi personalizzati.
3,Schöne Spielerei aber auf Dauer zu teuer
5,Ci sono due pacchettini ognuno da 10 pezzi.
5,Beh che dire? Ovviamente sono perfettearrivate in ordine senza un minimo segno.
1,Non le ho proprio aperte perché le ho acquistate insieme alla stampante provando quelle che già erano inserite nella stampante ho notato la pessima qualità di stampa e la pessima durata della stampa mai più tecnologia zink
3,Per quello che sono cioè 20 cartoncini sono davvero troppo cari!!!!
5,Tres bon produit
5,I bought it as a gift to go alongside the instant camera that I had gotten and it's safe to say that it worked really well! I'm especially impressed with how fast the picture dries after it gets printed.
5,Es lo que hay... es el papel que sirve para la cámara 🤪
2,Used the camera for one day whilst down in Brighton and we took 3 pictures all of which looked horrible and washed out. The quality was just very poor even for how small the papers were. The best way to describe the picture quality is like an old mobile phone camera that takes very pixelated over exposed images. The camera itself looks cool but thats not enough of a reason to sell it. Sent it back and now looking to buy an Instax camera instead.
5,Buona la qualità di stampa molto veloce
5,formato 5x7.6 cm con carta adesiva non ha il bordo bianco
5,Todo genial
5,Works very nicely with kodak camera good price for a 20 sheets.
5,Ce papier a été livré très rapidement ce qui était très bien parce que je voulais vraiment emporter mon appareil photo pour mon voyage. Je suis tellement content d'avoir pu le faire car ce papier rend vos impressions vibrantes en couleur et vraiment capte chaque détail.

5,buona qualità dei colori e adesivo resistente
5,Gut
5,Spedizione Veloce e prodotto Ottimo
5,Buena calidad
5,Ottimo
5,Wenn Sie Ihre Fotos ausdrucken wollen dann ist das das beste Papier! Es reduziert den Bedarf an einem Toner oder Patronen weil das Endprodukt vor solchen Sachen wie Wasser und Schmutz geschützt wird.
4,Ottimo prodotto come immaginavo...
5,Buen material calidad- precio.
5,si posso incollare ovunque
5,Todo ok van bien
1,Horrible tanto el papel como la cámara.No sirve pa nada.  Solo te desespera.Fotos de nefasta Calidad
5,Dieses Druckpapier ist wirklich einfach zu nutzen und es macht hochwertige Bilder. Alles was Sie tun sollen ist es in Ihr Gerät zu laden und Sie sind fertig!
5,Dieses Druckerpapier ist wunderschön weil es sofort trocknet! Sie sollen sich keine Sorgen machen darüber dass Ihre Fingerabdrücke darauf bleiben wenn Sie es zum ersten Mal halten.
1,Not recommended at all. I ordered 100 films get only 20 waiting for solution or apology. Nothing was happening I'm very disappointed
1,Las imágenes que proporciona la marca no tienen nada que ver con las reales. No son de buena calidad y encima es color no tiene nada que ver. Una de las fotos debería ser blanco y negro y es rosa. Tampoco se queda recto el papel si no que se queda curvo tras imprimirse.En fin un desproposito por parte de KOdak creando una cámara y un papel de tan mala calidad.
5,Parfait
5,Bought on sale for only £4! Amazing
3,Es hat nichts gebracht auch mit diesem Papier würde nicht gedruckt !!
5,Ottimo prodotto
5,Mi piace molto il fatto che ci sia l’opzione che consente di incorniciare la foto e quella che permette di poterla incollare dove si desidera. Inoltre posso assicurarvi che non rimarrete delusi dalla qualità delle stampe!
5,Este papel es realmente genial para las fotos de la cámara del teléfono ya que tiene una fuerte integridad de colores así que cada uno de los colores está imprimido y las fotos salen con una gran precisión.
5,Works well woth my HP Sprocket
5,Easy to fit and use
5,Ce paquet de papiers fonctionne exactement comme je le pensais. Ce n'est pas difficile à mettre dans la caméra et puis les impressions elles-mêmes sortent de très bonne qualité.
5,Ottimo
5,Came quickly perfect fit for my camera.
5,Honestamente este papel es lo mejor que se ha hecho para impresiones instantáneas ya que elimina la necesidad de usar cartuchos y toners por ejemplo que son bastante caros y complicados para usar.
5,Grazie alla tecnologia ZINC sono in grado di stampare scatti che dureranno a lungo il che è paragonabile alle stampe professionali. Non devi nemmeno assicurarti di conservarli nelle p0erfette condizioni.
1,Ho ricevuto una sola bustina integra l'altra era aperta e con carta mancante. Lo scatolo era aperto e strappato. Probabilmente fondo di magazzino o reso... SCONSIGLIATO!
5,All fine
5,Preis /Leistung super
5,Mi piacciono molto perché sono adesivi! Consiglierei di attaccarli non molto tempo dopo la stampa per evitare il raggomitolamento degli stessi.
5,Ottima qualità.Le foto inoltre sono adesive.Quindi molto versatili.
2,Costa troppo
1,Quality not good
5,Nessun problema
5,Bien. Tal como esperaba.

2,Una calidad de impresión pésima.
5,Prodotto ottimo
1,Malo
5,Están en excelentes condiciones
5,Me gusto el tamaño
2,First of all how do you feed ink to the mini printer. If the prints supply the ink then this package that you sent to me is dried up. I am not getting any picture. They are coming out blank. Please how should I proceed with this. Thank you.
5,It works perfect
5,Not much to say. The backing comes off and then you have fun stickers.
5,Great poser quality. Excellent imaging. Crisp and immediate. A terrific brand
5,Gracias excelente calidad

5,Easy to install.Have not extensively used to give feedback.Be prepared to use a few before you get used to the camera.
5,Buen precio y servicio de entrega
5,Werkt prima.
5,Llego rápido y en buen estado
5,Fonctionne à merveille j'ai récemment acheté un LG Pocket et j'avais peur de pas trouvé de papier photo en bas de 40$ et 18$ de transport no way avec Kodak on se trompe pas et se n'est pas la best 4K full high quality parfait pour entertain.
5,Excelente qualidade! Comprei para utilizar em uma Polaroid Snap e é compatível.Só é necessário usar o cartão de calibração original Polaroid.
5,Bien et facile a utilisé
5,No comments
2,Print saturated red face.
1,Pictures printed are bad quality with visible horizontal lines that should not show
5,Zink paper como outros mas com a saudosa identidade Kodak
2,very pixeled pictures
5,Wonderful Vendor - Product is great !WILL Buy again !
