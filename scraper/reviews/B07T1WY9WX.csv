5,I own a Canon PIXMA TR4522 all-in-one printer and as expected was mildly disgusted by the fact that printer manufacturers are STILL running their "ink racket." You know the one where one full set of ink cartridges costs almost as much as a whole new printer the "standard yield" tanks are half-filled and the "high yield" tanks are actually full...I do not print very often and as a result I end up using more ink for the self-cleaning cycles than I do for actual printing. It didn't seem prudent to pay for genuine Canon tanks when most of my ink ends up soaked into a sponge inside the printer so I chose to search the aftermarket world. In the sea of Amazon sellers I stumbled across Coloretto and thought I would give them a chance.The tanks arrived properly sealed and in minimal eco-friendly packaging. The box itself and accompanying literature are made with recycled paper nicely fitting the theme of recycled cartridges. Installation was just as mildly-awkward as the Canon cartridges are but this is due to Canon's design. My printer recognized the new tanks immediately and showed them as "full." Ink levels as I have used the printer have dropped at a rate I expect and even though Canon's software is now bugging me about low ink levels I have seen no loss of output as I have seen in the past with other brands leading me to believe the manufacturer isn't "short-filling" them to increase profit margins.Print quality is actually BETTER than the original Canon tanks there is less bleed-over; this leads to crisper images and clearer text/lines. The black ink is slightly darker than Canon's which may make color photos print out a tiny bit darker but you really have to do a side-by-side comparison to notice.My printer and these tanks have been stored/used in my "man cave" aka garage a garage that is not climate-controlled. As such they have been exposed to the full outdoor temperature and humidity ranges of New England. All winter long they suffer sub-freezing temps until I fire up the kerosene heater and they get warmed up to the 70s. I've never had a leak or any issue with them whatsoever. I don't have to perform multiple "deep cleanings" if I don't use the printer for a few weeks like I often had to do with the Canon tanks.I am happy to support manufacturers that provide a good product and that is why I just ordered my second set of Coloretto tanks for my printer!For reviewers that have sought out assistance from the manufacturer and cannot find a way to do so they *do* provide a customer service Email address on the small card that the cute little iguana paper clips (free gift) are attached to. {{service@colorettoink.com}} I haven't had a need to contact them as my experience has been quite satisfactory.
5,I just hope it won’t dries up too soon
5,Love it. Thanks
5,I was using Costco's remanufactured cartridges for the longest time in my Cannon printer until for some reason they stopped working. Then it became a challenge to even find Cannon printer cartridges due to supply chain issues. Printer has been sitting there for months collecting dust and I was about ready to toss it and get another one but came across these reasonable priced cartridges. I was nervous they wouldn't work just like the Costco ones but to my surprise they worked perfectly! My old Cannon printer lives again!
5,I've had recycled printer cartridges put the printer in error mode stating that in needed repair. These cartridges have never gave me this problem. I recommend them.
5,I had to check because I’m in disbelief but I’ve been using these same cartridges since may 25. It’s the end of July.For context I run a small junk journal business from Etsy (junkbooksbyjess- shameless plug) I’m also a ring planner who loves printables.These cartridges have said low ink since early June BUT… and this is a big BUT (hehe)They are still going strong.i even purchased back ups because every print job I do I am convinced I’m going to see an alert on my laptop saying “girl- I’m done. Please stop already.”But nope. Still printing like I just bought them.And no I’m not paid to write a good review.I freaking wish but alas I’m just a girl who prints A LOT.Buy these.
5,Easy to install and fit perfectly. No color difference from the ones Canon offer. Will buy again
5,I am glad I tried this because it is cheaper than the real ones and it has good quality.
5,Unlike the other guys I recently bought ink from these cartridges were recognized immediately in my TR4500 and work great.
5,I’ve bought remanufactured ink from other places and even in the beginning when I knew they were brand new would get a message that I was low on ink.  These are working great and also I’m not getting a message that they are low on ink. Awesome!
5,The ink was great quality it came packaged nicely with a box that was recyclable too. Highly recommend.
5,These print great. Lets see how long it last though.
5,Awesome
5,The quality of the print is 100% equal to the official Canon brand for much less of a price. My only regret was not knowing about this company sooner. I'll never go back!
3,This is a waste of money at least for Cannon. It works perfectly at the beginning but it will leak and conduct alignment issues.
5,I was skeptical  with a remanufactered printer cartridge.  Never had much luck with them. These cartridges  don't  leak and are professionally  packaged.  Give these a try!
5,Used before but had to return these cause my printer broke and didn’t need them after all
1,If I could give negative stars I would because these don’t even deserve one star! I bought these print cartridges to keep on hand when my printer was low on ink. Yesterday I put the black one in my printer and I immediately got an error code that my printer was overheating and needed repair. I googled the code and one suggestion was to try and replace the ink cartridge. I went out and bought a Canon ink cartridge put it in my printer and thankfully I didn’t need to repair or replace my printer. I have bought other lower priced ink cartridges in the past from other sellers and never had an issue. I can’t return it because as I said I bought it to keep as a spare so by the time I needed it the return window had closed. What a waste of money and time and so very frustrating. They say “you get what you paid for” but I almost had to replace my printer because of this issue. Terrible experience!
5,Great deal very well packages with instructions to make easy install.  Also 2 little cute paperclips the wife loved. Would buy again.
5,I've bought from this company 4 times in the last year and each time have had the best experience with the product. It prints just as well as brand new cartridges and I feel good about being somewhat green in utilizing remanufactured cartridges. I have had zero issues with any of my cartridges in my Canon Pixma printer and will continue to use.I also love the little chameleon paperclips - so cute!
5,Great value for the price!
5,Worked good
5,Just as good as Canon and cheaper. Only use for home printer but haven't had a problem yet with this product.
5,What can I say? It's ink it's compatible and it's cheap! Delivered promptly arrived in really great packaging that included an alcohol wipe in case the printer didn't recognize the cartridge. Will definitely buy again when needed.
5,Ink cartridges arrived promptly and work as well as the originals in our Canon printer.  The price was good also. Will reorder as needed.
5,I will update this review as I use the cartridges more however the first impressions this ink gave me left me speechless.(Update 9/12/2021 cartridges are still printing great! Haven't needed to change them yet and they're as crisp as when I originally received them!)Wonderful packaging good price clean full cartridges wonderful print quality!(Using inside my Canon PIXMA MG2522)Even tested this ink on my transparent sticker sheets dried instantly and printed very sharp/clear.(Small note make sure you print with high res/high quality images the print can only look as crisp as the original file does.)I couldn't be more pleased with this purchase if you are on the fence I would highly recommend you purchase these cartridges.
5,This is a best buy- don't hesitate.
2,First of all these are not XL. As with the Canon carts I only got about 10 pages of standard printing. I get more ink from a pen.Second the colors are slightly off no matter what adjustments you make.Thirdly I had to push them into place with more effort than it should have needed. I thought I broke my printer when it snapped in.
5,Will purchase again delivery time was crucial.
2,Was worth a shot but for my purposes the shadows all look poorly saturated with a red tint. Same files printed with OEM cartridges look much better.
4,Didn’t last as long as I thought it would.
4,I'm so sorry to say this is awful ink. The picture here is copied from a very clear recipe and my ink is still very full. Every copy has been like this. All faded copies. I'm disappointed in myself for not listening to other reviews. Will never purchase again. I really try to give the benefit of the doubt but this was a very bad purchase. :(
3,The cartridge it’s coming almost empty…with the originals you print a lot…but with this one’s I printing something like a 60 times and that’s it…anyway it’s a poor quality print!!!…Not recommended!!!
5,For the money this product is worth every penny. At a fraction of the cost of name brand ink cartridges you can't go wrong. My printer recognized the cartridges and no problem. The only issue I had is the color was off. I was making some papercrafts and ran out of ink so I popped the cartridges in and printed more of what I needed and the color was off so I will still use them but my cave system (D&D) will be two different colors now I guess it just adds a little flavor now lol...All in all I highly recommend  these cartridges if your looking for a cheaper but high quality alternative to the more expensive cannon cartridges.
4,Had problems with the first one they sent but contacted them and got a new one works perfect good color
5,I have used this ink since I got my Canon MG2522 very happy with product and the ink lasts a long time.Will continue to purchase as long as it is available. Very good print quality as well.
3,Pictures I printed looked faded and dim.  The ink did last quite a while though
5,Good value!
4,I'm using this in my Canon Pixma TR4500. The printer recognized them with no problem. However when I checked the ink levels the black was way lower then the color.  I needed to finish a project so I had no choice but to use these ink cartridges. The print quality is good but I'm still not happy the ink levels were NOT full on the black.
4,I use my printer a lot at home for schoolwork and lots of office work for my parents so this ink was so good for the price. The only thing is.. I bought this back January for $26 which I was so set on having this become my regular ink but now it is $44? almost twice the price which makes it merely the same as the name brand one. Why did the price go up so suddenly? The presentation and paper clips are so cute.
5,I liked it a lot and ordered it twice
5,It seems to last longer than the Canon XL it's much cheaper and the prints are perfect .I'll definitely  reorder and by the way Seller Provides Prompt Service excellent packaging with clear instructions. Cannot ask for more.Thanks so m much
5,This product is the same as new but costing less. Also I ordered and received the SAME day without having to leave my home. Fantastic
4,I like this ink. I'm a heavy photo printer.  So far this ink has been good. Works with my cannon mx490 just fine. No issues there. No streaks while printing. Color comes out looking good. Not sure how long the ink will last but currently happy with this ink so far.
5,Great quality printing
5,first impression really sells the product as the mfgr. spent time designing his packaging to protect the product  second  the packaging keeps the ink in the cartridge and not all over your hands  thanks. Fits int the bracket like a glove and I was up and running I will be buying this product in the future.the
5,The black looks black. The colors look like the colors as they should. No need to get more complicated about ink cartridges. They're not life-changing but they do what they're expected to do at a good price.
4,Just as I hoped and at a great price!
5,As easy to install as the Canon cartridges. Was worried that it wouldn't be a match or that I wouldn't like the print quality but turned out there were no problems whatsoever. Nice print quality. I would buy again.
5,Arrived quickly and works as expected. Came with cute little chameleon paper clips to emphasize it's more environmentally friendly. I can't say how it will stand up over time but I have no reason to doubt that it will function well as everything I have seen so far is good business.
5,Cost of print cartridges is absolutely higher during this COVID time but the upshot is that I am now printing a lot less b/c I see clear market manipulation. I paid a little less for these cartridges and they work just as well as the full price ones.
5,As soon as I received them I popped the ink cartridges in and worked just fine. Printed within seconds. Found price cheaper than several websites and stores. Awesome products. Shipped & Received in a couple of days.
5,Works great!
4,Consider the age of the printer model I thought the ink - especially remanufactured - was a bit overpriced.
5,So far so good I only printed one of it was a little grainy but maybe it was what I printed and it required a lot of ink on my project.I’m happy with the price for this productPackaging was superb I loved it.
4,My printer/computer did not recognize and reset after installing these ink cartridges.Stay with OE ink.
5,Dislike the fact "not enough ink." I printed 3 pages of a photo w/ colornow that was yesterday now the printer is telling me"change color cartridge". I wish you can buy containers instead. I just I would have to buy an Epsom printer!
4,Great for the price. But ink does not seem to last as long as Canon brand.
5,Think ink is very nice. I haven't used such an easy generic ink before. My printer took it no problem. It also says that use of it does not void the manufacturer's warranty. I don't know if it that is true or not but it doesn't matter as long at it installs so easily. It also looks to be pretty environmentally friendly which is nice. I'm happy I found this product!
5,This is the second time I have ordered this ink from Amazon. Very pleased!!
5,Excellent product!!  This product came in very sturdy compact quality packaging!  Quality packaging denotes a quality product in my opinion.  Plus it was a very good price.  Installed easily and ink is also great quality!! Will definitely purchase from this company again!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
5,I love this ink so far. It has been coming out beautifully for both my color and black prints. I look forward to seeing how long it lasts and possibly ordering more in the future.  Side note it came with some really cute chameleon paper clips that I love!
5,The quality of the ink is very good.This was a great experience. Item arrived quickly it is brand new it's fresh works great and is authentic. Item is just as described. I would recommend.
5,I am an averger user of the printer these ink lasted me 6 months where the other were only a short time and also the value and discount at check out?
4,Sometimes ink gets too heavy which will use up the ink way faster. And by too heavy I mean like enough to soak through standard paper it may just be a bad cartridge so I'm going to try it one more time.
5,Product is a refill but in good shape.  Arrived quickly (same day) and works as expected.
5,Cheap fast and efficient. It lasted just as long as a factory cartridge. Even comes with cool little paperclips.
5,Printer ink is expensive and this works as well as the name brand for less.
4,For it being remanufactured it’s not bad. I actually liked this ink!
1,Once I installed the color cartridge it ONLY printed yellows and greens. NO other colors. So it was a waste of time and money with this "refurbished" ink cartridges.
4,I didn't have to "fight" to get the cartridge into the carriage.
5,I will definitely be ordering again. I also love the paper clips and tips that comes with it. Such a cute touch. With difficulties finding ink and these working so amazing I will be ordering again before I run out.
4,Loads easily no error codes and print quality seems good.  Less than name brand will see if they last as long if they do will update.
4,Great customer packaging.  Also had good customer relation effect when they used memos for feedback.  They added cool chameleon paper clips.  Also liked the fact that it is recycled cartridges.
5,Not going to lieI had my doubts about this product but it has done a superb job! The color seems even more vivid than the ink I normally use. Made a returning customer out of me!
5,I am very happy with the quality of ink. The black is true and seems to be holding out well. I haven't used much of the color but expect it will be of good quality as well.
5,I have been using these ink cartridges in my Canon Pixma printer. They have been performing perfectly. No bleeding no gloppy messes or leaking at all. Now I know this sounds all "nerdy" but I loved the little thank you card and the business card with the Chameleon Paper Clips attached to it. Thank you for the fast shipping and the great service. AND the clips.
4,Price was good couldn't get same one previously ordered.  Wihave to see how good they print
5,The print quality is very good and the color cartridge gives excellent color documents. I will buy again when I need ink for my canon printer. These cartridges seem like a good value for the money.
4,Seems good so far ink prints somewhat lighter than the ink that cake with the printer but overall it gets the job done !
5,The print quality was great. The ease of use in regards to swapping out original cartridges and replacing with these was super easy. My printer recognized them immediately and great pronting followed. Will definitely purchase again.
5,Usually the refurnished cartridges are somewhere between ok to good. But the ink quality from these refurnished cartridges are on par with new ones! Well worth the savings and would buy again.
4,Great ink
5,This ink was purchased for a replacement for Cannon 243 and 244 ink that was nowhere to be found in the stores. Worked great. Will order again.
5,I purchased this for the first time for my home office use because of the low cost. Works just as well if not better than the one I have been purchasing from the printer's manufacturer.
5,I found the packaging to be done very well. The product was protected and they even provided a card with instructions and a cloth to clean the cartridge in case it didn't work. Very impressed. Great value.
5,This is the best "refilled" ink product that I have found. It lasts.... others have run out of ink quickly. This product  lasts.
1,I bought this combo pack and was very excited. They first worked then after some time the color one has become "fuzzy" on printing due to it not being able to print dark colors. The black cartridge leaves big gaps. I tried running the cleaning process on both if them twice but even afterwords I don't know if the ink dried up the ports are clogged or broken in some fashion.  The paperclips are awesome though! Hope you guys improve quality. I will check back to see! :)
5,I have ordered this product 3X and I have absolutely no problems with the product or the merchant.  You won't go wrong with this product.  Joseph
5,This is is great quality for the money and the packaging & design is detailed. I love the easy instructions and the awesome little Chamaeleon paper clips as an added bonus! So cute!
5,I'm retired and do some committee work.  Even though I don't use my printer for paid employment I appreciate the quality look of the printed pages.
5,I liked this ink very much.i believe the print quality is comparable to Canon brand and this brand is less expensive. This is  now the ink I will buy for my Pixmza! Thanks!
2,I should be able to use a cartridge a few months or even more if it is sealed. I have always been able to do that. The black cartridge was dried out when I went to use it and it was sealed up inside a box and inside another bag.
5,I just bought a Canon MG2522 printer. By mistake I ordered one without ink inside. that's horrible for me. this product need both black and color ink inside to print something.  I have to buy this product and put it into the printer. fortunately it works. Next time I will buy an all-in-one printer my god!!!
5,Amazing ink it was able to print a color photo very nicely and easy to set up love this ink
5,The product shipped very quickly and I received before the expected date. The quality of the prints are great.
5,Couldn’t find ink in store where I normally buy so figure try these. Came in on time. No problem installing
2,it hardly printed 20-30 pages normal print recently it started misprinting. I contacted the support few days ago and shared whatever picture they asked now there is no response. looks like they realized it is the cartridge issue. Anyways this is not a good product we will ignore this until we really affected with some critical inconvenience.
5,I was a little concerned with a remanufactured ink cartridge. I've had problems in the past with some purchases where the cartridge leaked.  So far this one has not leaked and has given me clear print. Must less than buying new and works great.
5,Worked just fine in my printer. I went ahead and cleaned off the chip on the back to be sure it worked as recommended.
5,Work perfectly in my printer.  Makes bright colorful prints.
5,I liked that this product was just a good as the canon named product
5,Went right into my printer and away I go printing!!!
5,Fast shipping great quality
4,It has given me good quality prints. I'm very satisfied with both cartridges and their longevity due to me printing a lot with me being a online student.
5,I use this product to continue to make high quality prints.
5,The cartridges work great just like I wanted and needed.- and will be re-ordered
5,Just installed these about a week ago .  No problems..Working great!
2,Bought this ink in September only to find out the color was empty when I went to use in December.
5,No issues.  No need for me to buy the more expensive brand name cartridges when this brand works just as well.
5,These cartridges were far superior to the previous cartridges I had ordered.  They print clear and you dont have to realign all the time
5,Looking for good long lasting ink but hate paying more for ink than the printer? This is it! Less than half the price as name brand and lasts just as long if not longer! Will be buying this kind from now on!
5,Great quality ink for less than name brand..I will purchase again !
5,I was frustrated that Onn replacements didn't work on my printer. These work perfect
5,I wasn't sure what to expect with remanufactured? I was pleasantly surprised.I will be buying from this brand again.I do recommend.The paper clip gifts are so cute. Looks like the green image on the box. A very thoughtful idea.
5,Quality and quanity all in one! Love tge combo packs. And it is compatible with my Canon pixma 440!
5,ink quality
3,Sucks! Clogged printer kept giving printer errors.. horrible product do not buy. Black ink ran out SUPER FAST!!

5,Worked as well as name brand. Would purchase again.
4,product was fine for the price
5,We will see how long the ink lasts.  So far so good
5,Alway use this nik good to save money
5,Just as good as Canon but less expensive.

5,Worked great better than other cartridges I have purchased
5,The ink cartridge fit the cartridge space of my canon printer perfectly. Am happy with product and priced very competitively. will buy again
5,Liked the quality of the ink. It cost a lot less the department store brands and prints many more pages too
5,Really good quality ink. Unlike some I had before that smugged.
5,Very good ink for the price.
3,The black cartridge worked fine. The color cartridge wouldn't work at all. $44 for one workable cartridge means I would have been better off going straight to Canon.
5,Great product I definitely recommended. 10 stars product. Thanks
5,works goof
5,Good price for good quality
5,Great product great service!
5,The price is great the prints are perfect and the packaging is lovely. I would definitely purchase again!
5,Great product
5,These worked just like the oem ink.  and are less than half the price.
1,I printed some pages and noticed I wasnt getting cyan as the colors of some pages were weird.  I tried a nozzle check and there was no cyan coming out.  I had tried to clean the cartridge itself but noticed when I had been cleaning no cyan ever came out.  Is there really no cyan in this color cartridge?  The black cartridge works fine with no issue but I am starting to believe there was no cyan loaded into the color cartridge I had received.
5,Good buy! Ink is good quality and price is competitive
5,Really good product
5,I like this item.
5,Don’t use my printer that much but these cartridges fit the bill !!👍
5,Had issue with black ink after contacting them they promptly send an replacementall is well.
5,Great product for price. Print quality is great
5,6/23/20 black ink cartridge printing red
5,Received ink quickly in great condition and high quality ink. Easy to install. Will re order from here again.
2,I was unable to purchase the cartridges I typically buy so I had to go with these.I was hopeful that a previous bad experience was an isolated incident. I needed ink ASAP so I gave it a try.But no it appears that it’s just not the best product.The color cartridge prints almost like watercolors. Everything appears faded and the colors don’t seem quite right.
5,very good!!
5,Seems to work excellent. No warnings to ignore prints like new Brand name cartridges.
5,Good quality product. save money instead of buying new
5,Ink cartridge worked as described. Thank you
5,Works like or better than the more expensive
5,It was easy to install and prints great
5,Fast delivery ink cartridges worked well
5,Just like the picture and prints lovely
5,Worked fine in printer
5,Fast delivery and quality product
5,Awesome product! Works perfectly with my printer!
5,Works well and was as advertised.
5,Very happy quality ink!!
5,This Ink was at a great price and I used it for printing great pictures.
5,Thanks for super fast delivery ink works as expected
5,Love this! Perfect fit. Great for the money!
5,I love it!!!! Love the price!!!
5,very good presentation y quality.
5,As advertised .Good value for cost.
1,I'm sure that these are fine cartridges in most cases. Mine started to print jagged lines of text. I did all the cleaning and adjusting that I could find and the printer says everything is fine. Cleaned the cartridges with alcohol wipe as recommended.Tried to find a contact for product support in the docs that came with the ink and on amazon. No phone or email addresses to be found just promises that the cartridges are warranted for up to a year. What good is a warranty if there is no way to contact the seller?
5,Works great
5,Just what I needed
5,I have no problems with this product
5,Can’t say much great quality products
5,Ink worked just fine in my printer.
5,Perfect
5,Great print quality. Would never know they were re-manufactured
1,The color cartridge is not performing properly.  It is producing browns instead of reds.  Very disappointed.
5,I love them & recyclable
5,Liked good product
5,For my canon printer
5,Very good!
5,Great!
5,Love it
5,Great replacement cartrdige.
2,These ink cartridges did not work at all.  Wasted money.
5,No problems
3,It works
1,These never worked they were defective when they came. Hassle returning and I didn’t have the time to deal with back and forth emails and sending photos of the problem just took my loss. My suggestion is to use another company.
1,Have tried everything I know and read to do.  These will not work.  Did they get filled with print powder?  Disappointed.
1,I wish I never wasted my money on this. It never worked. It prints so inconsistently (some parts print so light that you can't read). Btw I am using new Canon TR4500 series priner and it was printing perfectly with original ink. I can't return it as my return window is closed.
1,I bought this and it’s my second time and this time I am disappointed the color cartridge works but the black does not. My printer won’t read it so I know it is damaged because the color one works find.
2,Purchased this for a pixma printer. This is the only ink that I've purchased that is wet and smears after printing. Will not order again
2,The black works perfectly but the color left ALL of my papers pink and yellow when they didn’t even have any pink or yellow within them but had blue purple green etc.
1,I made a total of six copies and now say low on ink.  Warning comes on printer.  Made sure it was clean and hadn't touched it between last copy and low ink signal.  Money down drain.
2,Did not fit printer as stated
1,I bought this set twice the first time i had no issues worked great i just replaced the color today and its printing in pools of ink. its bleeding all over anything i print.
2,My printers wouldn’t recognize these refills. I had to return.
1,The first time I purchased this it was 5 stars. This time the mandatory 1 star. Product quality was very poor this time.
1,Got it in and the black ink would not work wouldn’t even send one that would work instead wanted me to buy another one for 25 bucks hmmm no
1,I have only printed at most 25 pages of the black and it is already telling me it is about gone.  The color cartridge seems fine but the black should be lasting a lot more than 25 pages.  Not happy with this purchase.

5,We use this to replace our printer ink.
5,A quality cartridge with great colors.
5,Just as good as the original.  Print quality is good.
1,Ink is great in itself. Only problem is I ordered the first one on October 18th and had to order a new one by November 2nd.
5,I usually don’t write reviews but this deserves an exception. I love to print off things for my happy planner from Etsy & use a lot of ink. I’ve found that many remanufactured ink sellers only fill the cartridge up alittle more than 1/2 but this company is the only one I’ve found so far that fills it all the way up! You can tell this when you print something it will show you the amount of ink that’s left. I will definitely be getting my ink here from now on! ❤️
5,I love this company. The packaging is thoughtful and they give you these cute iguana shaped paperclips. The ink does just as good as other inks but it's just better. I'm never disappointed. I receive it in the mail as expected. The company just cares more about their product.
5,Works with TS3322 perfectly!!!!
2,The color ink didn’t last long only able toPrint 10 sheets of paper and it was time to replace

Love the thank you note and 2 cutest paper clips attached. My Cannon MX490 printer accepted immediately. I printed some invoices and a photo all came out very clear and sharp. I will definitely purchase again.

5,Good quality
5,Was great just what I was looking for
5,I have ordered this ink set and others for my Canon Pixma and the Colloretto brand has far surpassed even the Canon brand. I do tons of printing as a college student easily 1000+ pages per course and 5-6 courses per semester that's a lot of money each semester. But the Coloretto cartridges last at least 100 color pages longer easily giving me 400+ pages per set. I also love the quality of the color there's no bleeding of color or black through the papers or onto the next pages. I do a lot of double-sided printing and these black cartridges are so much better at not bleeding even with the cheapest of cheap paper. Now I don't print a lot of photos so my printer settings are set for draft printing but the photos I have printed come out great.
5,I really like the ink it was the most affordable option on amazon at the time. I will definitely be ordering it again because I got these really cute chameleon clips with it.
5,Great packaging arrived quick- love the clips. Ink works great! Definitely will be back
5,The ink Works awesome fit right in and the pictures are coming out awesome
5,Muy buena la calidad de impresión. Además vino muy bien empacado
5,The ink works great! Also the additional paper clips are so cute!
4,I don't know I received a bad batch but everything I print comes out blurry.
5,Just as expected.
1,I bought those in cartridges and after a week of usage my printer started to notice me about ''ink absorber'' being almonst full. The second week it completely stopped working. The ink was all over inside the printer and I couldnt clean those absorbers because they came out in chunks completely wet of ink.Never had trouble with my printer before. It might be not directly because of the usage of the cartridge... May be just a bad luck... But I bought a new printer and be sure I won't take any chance buying these again!
5,We have had trouble with other ink cartridges in the past we almost decided to buy a new printer until we tried these ink cartridges and they work amazing great colour great quality freight shipping they were here with the next day and I even got free paper clips how exciting for my business thanks again😁
5,Ces cartouches ont été acceptées et reconnues par l'imprimante comme celles d'origine. Indication de niveau comme auparavant. Même qualité d'impression à prix modique. Excellent!
4,I have only had this product for a few days but what I have used it for so far has been good. Great print quality and value for the money.
5,The ink cartridges fit perfectly in my Canon printer and I save $30. Couldn’t get better than that! Definitely purchasing again when these ones run out
5,Parfait!  L'imprimante a reconnu de suite les cartouches et la couleur est très bien ! C'est sûr que je les rachèterai! Pour la longévité je ne peux rien dire je viens de les utiliser
4,good colour and price
