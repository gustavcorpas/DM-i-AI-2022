4,It sounds great and looks great; I really like this surround sound for the price 60 days after I purchased it the remote quit working.
5,I really like these speakers. There's a lot of different inputs so you can have multiple devices hooked up. The speaker wire length is good and long enough for a standard speaker placement. My only gripe is that the subwoofer can not be fully turned off with the onboard settings alone. At night I don't want to rumble the house when watching shows. You are able to fix this in EQ settings on a PC but im not sure about other devices. Overall I like them a lot.
5,We were skeptical about these because they aren't expensive but after having it for about a month now I can honestly say it's a great buy. We've had no issues. Sound quality is great didn't seem like my boyfriend had much trouble putting it together and putting up the speakers. The cords it comes with are not super long but we have a small apartment so it worked nicely for us. Great product.
5,I really like the sound and the price is nice for the the sound I bought 2 one for my living room and one for my garage it helps me when I work out.
5,I was surprised how good these sound for under $200.
3,For the price it's not bad really loud for small speakers but the sw in the reserver like to short after the first 2 months
3,These would have gotten 4 stars but for the useless always on blindingly bright LED stips in the front and the instructionless speaker mounts as no one wants to drill into something without knowing where and how deep is safe.
3,The digital port doesn't work and have to use the rca and the sound quality it tinny
5,Sorry remote control.  Broke within 2 months.
5,Plenty loud enough.  Had to turn down the subwolfer because it was too strong
5,I really like that it had some many different ways to connect. Super awesome!!
5,My son was who actually found and Picked this Home Theater System for my Online Classes & Entertaining Music Fun!! I have enjoyed this Product for 2 Months and I haven’t had absolutely Any Issues and I’m so Happy with it!! This Product is well worth so much more Money!!
5,Set up was my only headache or frustration. Other then that the sound quality is nice. It made my 14 year old tv sound way better.
2,I was really enjoying this setup.  Not quite as loud as I wanted but I was really satisfied with the quality of sound.  That was until yesterday when the Sub Woofer went out.  I "massaged" the main case and it came back but eventually it died out completely.  I see no option for a return.  I do not recommend but for the price I got what I paid for.
5,Absolutely amazing I used to have a basic flat speaker under my projector screen but this literally vibrates my couch. I watched Jurassic park for testing and when those roars came omfg you can feel the scenes where the dinosaur is breathing and walking. WHEN YOU TRY THIS YOU WILL NEVER GO BACK.
5,The speakers are super f***ing nice and I love surround sound now lol. However I’m not sure what happened but the box had at least 10 of some small brown bug inside. Which are now free in my apartment:/. Not sure who’s to blame hence the five star review but I guess just a warning? Good sound system open it outside your home lol
5,Awesome
5,I love it
5,When installing this unit for optical cable you have to pull off the plastic rubber tips.
5,Easy set up great sound ! Sub woofer is awesome!
2,Not sure if I just got a dud but after setting it all up sub was already blown
2,I connected to my 65 inch TV. That wasn't really a good choice. The bass has a tendency to rumble. It is nice that the remote was able to equalize the volume levels. The Bluetooth is also nice. I can't really recommend these speakers though.
5,The sound is great
2,This is advertised like it has a DVD player. It does not. That is the only reason I bought this. I still have the surround sound for the TV and it’s ok. But can’t watch any movies.
3,Had trouble setting it up Directions not very clear. Took a while to get it to work. The optical cable din not fit into the Bass box.
5,Very fast delivery and great product looks and sounds great hooked up nicely to my TV and BT works great.
5,Sound quality is insane. Definitely glad I purchased
5,Easy set up and great sound for the price.
1,I don’t even know where to begin other than this was a tremendous disappointment.  The speakers wires and sub are noticeably cheap.  The system took a couple mins to setup but over an hour to troubleshoot once muffled audio emerged only from the sub.  Multiple methods and inputs connectors settings etc applied but to no avail.  This company should pay its patrons for experimenting this junk.  Please don’t waste your time.
5,Sounds Tony the Tiger GREAT in my bedroom...
5,Easy to install
5,Si me agradó mucho. Lo tengo conectado al TV del cuarto. Tiene buen sonido.
5,Quality easy to connect with optical cable included and great price.
5,GREAT SURROUND SOUND!!!!!
5,Works great
1,It works fine when I am not using any other sources with the tv but as soon as I change TV input to any other input like Apple TV it makes awful pound screeching noises and turns it’s volume to max the controller stops working and the only way to stop it is to power off the master switch.
1,Jumped thru all kinds of hoops it only works with Smart Phone wifi but not smart TV's that don't have old VCR jacks! I bought 2 different wifi boosters for TV but this unit works maybe once a month when it feels like it. Original sales company doesn't repond as it is after the Amazon guarantee period.VERY DISAPPOINTED!
1,This system though it sounds great in video is not worth the aggravation. It is not a simple install and the installation assistance offered in the manual is lacking in detail to assist any issues for the one that is attempting to set up their first Home Theater system. Would not recommend this system for novice audiophiles based on this as there is no actual installation and setup instruction videos available for this system anywhere on the internet.
1,Product became hot started sounding like static when I used the optic sound option. Had to return it.
1,not very good sound pop aloot sound too dont buy
1,One speaker failed out of the box.The small satellite speakers are cheap and light weight.
1,Missing half the products
1,It is very cheap material!
1,Junk don't know what I expected for $170 bucks but the background noise is unbearable. Tried optical and aux no bueno.
4,It has quality sound and the remote can  control each of the 5 speakers and subwoofer individually.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             This is a great little system for an all in one. We have an inexpensive projector and the sound was “tinny”. This is perfect and easy to assemble. All cables were included.For our projector we put this in the headphone jack with the included cable. We will likely need a longer version of this cable for our setup. But it’s so nice to have all the options included so you can make it work right out of the box.The sound is acceptable for our basement. I’m not sure it’s going to shake you out of your chair but it works for our needs.
3,Got my system back in Mid-March.  2 months later i started hearing a humming noise.  The speakers were fine but the subwoofer box was were the noise was coming from.  I had to get a replacement remote cause the original broke which took over 3 weeks to get cause it came from China.  Tried everything online to make the humming noise stop and got nothing.  Customer service put me back to Amazon they informed would be a $35 restocking fee to return and refund.  Got my remote and the humming noise still didn't go away.  Lesson learned...Not fully happy with this one.
5,This unit came to me USED the REMOTE  was CRUSHED I PAID for NEW ‼️ But it works GREAT sound wise. the separation is noticeable and loud. I called AMAZON & they gave me 72 dollars off the price‼️ They  are A GOOD CO. responsive too problems ‼️AND HAPPY TOO HELP‼️
5,I HAVE DISH SAT. FOR TV. I SIMPLY PLUGGED THE PHONO CABLES PROVIDED INTO THE BACK OF THE DISH RECEIVER AUDIO OUTPUT AND I WAS SET TO GO. SOUNDS REALLY NICE. I HEAR FREQUENCY RANGES THE TV (SAMSUNG 55" 4K) WAS NOT REPRODUCING. IT REALLY ADDED LIFE TO THE SOUNDS FROM THE TV. I WATCHED THE RANGERS HOCKEY GAME TONIGHT AND HEARD SOUNDS FROM THE AUDIENCE THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE HEARD. ON NCIS WHEN THE SHOW RETURNS FROM COMMERCIAL YOU REALLY HEAR THE THUD NOW. IF THE UNIT WAS NOT UP TO PAR I WOULD HAVE SAID IT. IF THE UNIT WASNT WORTH IT I WOULD HAVE SAID. CANT DO BETTER AT 135 BUCKS.
