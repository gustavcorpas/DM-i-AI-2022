4,I bought this mount because I wanted something for 24” stud spacing and I wanted sturdiness and the TV positioning this mount offers. I did not want extendable arms to enable the 24” stud spacing. I wanted a one piece mount.It also has vertical members at the ends that I thought may help for attachment. I mounted on metal studs and felt 4 screws wouldn’t be enough.The mount is heavy due to the pivot hinge. Appears to be fairly well constructed. The metal frame was fairly soft which actually helped as I added 3 self taping screws at each end to help the fastening of the 4 included lags to the studs.Studs were actually a tad over 24” oc.Now the ding of one star. The brackets that mount to the TV lock into the mount rails by screwing a clip. Instead of providing a thumb screw they provide Phillips bolts. Every mount I have purchased in the past has a type of screw to make this part easy to lock the TV in.Not this one. Even though the mount extends from the wall you would need to squeeze in between the tv and the wall to install these screws with a screw driver. I decided to buy thumb screws instead of trying to get in there behind an 85” TV with a screw driver.So for over $100 they should have thumb screws. Cost me $10 bucks. Thus 4 instead of 5 stars. Also I didn’t see a template as advertised. No big deal.Added note. I installed drywall anchors to hold up the mount when positioning it and anchoring to the studs. This made a big difference. Easy to set these drywall screws level and set in the slots on this bracket. I just put these screws in and left them sticking out a bit and hung the mount on the screws.I had to slide the mount on these screws slightly to hit the studs. So this method really helped me mount this thing.
5,I hung an 85" television with this and it works perfectly.  The only concern I have is when adjusting the angles you must use two people due to the size of the TV and its tendency to flex when trying to move it on your own.
5,The most sturdiest mount. I purchased 3 mounts from different brands for my 85 inch TV and this one was the most sturdiest of all. This was about $20 cheaper too.
4,the only thing missing is an up/down function other than that it works great and very easy to position.
5,Just Purchased it.  Range of motion is great.  I’m able to prepare meals in the kitchen is located off the Family Room and see th 65” TV with zero obstruction.  I Love It!
5,Pretty sturdy tv mount. We just put up our 86 inch Samsung tv. The weight of the TV is about 90 pounds . It hold its pretty well. The only thing missing in package was the drill bit.
5,Install went well as we followed directions hit one stud and is currently holding our 75” tv without issue.
5,This is a very well engineered product!  Installing it on to the wall was very easy!  They actually provide a template that makes marking the holes super easy.  Almost everything needed for installation was provided including the proper size drill and even a level!Once the bracket was on the wall it was simple to hang and secure the TV to the bracket and make any adjustments.  It is strong and stable.  I highly recommend this product!
4,I don't have much experience with different mounts as I never had a TV nice enough to mount. This brand seems like one of the better ones for mounts which doesn't cost an arm and a leg but also isn't made of thin metal that's gonna bend and fail. I used this mount with a QN90a 65" TV. Went with this XL version instead of the non XL for future proof for a bigger TV and for the extra sturdiness . Install was pretty straight forward as long as you can span 2 studs or you add blocking in wall or on the face to accept mount. This mount can span up to 24" spacing if needed. The full motion is great to have and makes getting behind the TV a breeze. The TV leveling feature makes this mount shine. If you don't get the mount completely level during install it has an adjust to level the TV after the fact.Some of the negatives (not deal breakers at all as they all have solutions) include the full motion action seems stiff as a lot of pressure on the TV to move it in and out. The instruction book states that the joints of the arms can be lubed to fix this problem. Another issue was the supplied bolts to mount the brackets were to long for TV had to use the provided spacers (which is why they are there) or could of simply purchased correct length screws.Would recommend
5,very strong. No weakness.
5,I love how easy it is to Install!  If you have all of your tools ready the TV laying face down on a flat surface and a helper handy you can get this installed with TV in place in 30 to 45 minutes.This mount works perfectly with my 83 inch LG OLED83C1AUA!  The TV is well within the weight limits of the mount restrictions and it provides a large number of positions for the TV.
5,This was by far the biggest strongest TV mount I have ever used. Very thick and sturdy and most importantly WIDE! So you can hit 2 studs easily plus use extra support with drywall anchors. I mounted a 75 inch Sony TV but you can pretty much mount a tank on this thing.
5,Mounted a 130 pound 85" Sony Bravia with no issues. Slight bounce when fully extended but I would only fully extend temporarily to work on the back. Very solid mount! Easy to install and adjust even with the TV mounted.
5,Very well made for heavier tv
4,This mount works great for our huge 80 in TV. The only reason I took a star off as it was a bit if a pain to install. They didn't lable any of the bags of hardware so it was a bit if a guessing game/trial and error to figure out what pieces to use where.
5,Very easy installation and adjustment. Works great for our huge TV lol and we can change the view to any part of our large living room.
5,Very strong mount. Well constructed. I have used two of these mounts and am pleased with both.
5,It's amazing. It was so easy to install. Came with introduction that made it supper easy to install. I bought a 86 in TV and was looking for a perfect TV mount and this one was it. For TV reference it's a LG Thin 86 Inch Tv From Costco. Holds the weight very sturdy and I can move the TV with ease.
5,This thing is a very heavy duty mounting bracket. I trust it .
5,Moves very smooth  holds tv in place during motion.  Mount is extra wide to gaurantee hitting studs. About the only mount that is better is over $300
5,This is the granddaddy of the mall it is so heavy and so strong and so easy to install. And when you are done you can practically do chips on it. The TV hooks on and drops into place very easily and it will stay there just using the meeting hooks. but if you want to you can swing the bottom into place and screw in the tiny retention screws and then it can't go anywhere even if you try to lift it off of the Mount. I give it my strong recommendation and I am very sure this thing will hold an 84 inch TV with no trouble at all. And that's what I'm going to be putting on it as soon as I dump my 65 inch and get my new 84 inch. It also comes with all the hardware you need to fit a variety of TV's just pick the amount of space and install the right size screws and they supply all of the sizes that you would ever need. Great job!
5,Easy install and works great with our 75” Samsung
4,Strong mount alittle on the heavy side. Other thing to note is that there's a reinforcement plate right in the middle of the bracket. So in my case I had an outlet and wire harness on the wall right in the middle of where I was mounting the TV. I'd suggest opening the center bracket plate to allow more access for electrical wiring.
5,OK. So the mount is very nice compared to the last one that was fixed couldn't adjust anything.That was a 59" TV new one is 82". (Samsung) also hard to find a mount for the size.Props for the mount itself material wise and the template for installation.Didn't use the hdmi cable level or lag bolts it came with.Lag bolts. Ditch the ones in this package. They are very light weight no markings painted black. I used 3“ 5/16 zinc coated ones that felt 100x better than what included(Menards) . Cheap and worth it if you really care.I still used a laser level magnetic stud finder tool etc. Template was spot on for levelness. Very good buy for price point. A lot easier to install than a flush mount unit. Extending mount out allows you to install all cables and not yell at everyone....Only thing I would change are the lag bolts. (those shouldn't have Phillip's heads on them)
5,Ordering from Amazon sight-unseen can be a bit unsettling.  I was worried about the sturdiness of this item.  I did not need to be concerned.  I mounted a 65 inch TV (which says it weighs 55 lbs).  It supports the TV nicely.  I like the tilt adjustments that you can make after mounting it.  The plastic piece that they provide for cable management is pretty handy but not made for a multitude of cables.  The mount movement is a bit stiff (to pull away from the wall and push back toward the wall).  It works better if you push one side in and then the other.  Some WD40 or graphite lubricant is getting applied next. I don't want to damage the TV by pushing and pulling on it too hard.  I would definitely buy this mount again.
5,I actually brought this thinking forward. At the moment I have a 40" flat screen TV and the mount worked perfectly fine even though I purchased the bigger one ranging from 42" upwards. I absolutely love the fact that the arms extend forward so it is easier for me access the back of the TV and then I can pushed it back to almost to the wall.I'd only caution folks that the DIY install needs some knowledge of carpentry and tools. I was lucky I had a carpenter working on another project at my home. Just tipped him 30 bucks and a cup of coffee to have him install the arm installed. Once the arm was installed rest was a breeze (did it myself) to fix panels behind the TV and put the TV on the arm.Overall am very happy with the product. Worth the investment.
5,Loved it mounted a 83” tv wouldn’t use no other one well worth it.
5,The point of this contraption is to allow the TV to stick out from the wall with no strain on the mounting material. It will tilt left and right and it will move the TV forward by several inches (I didn't measure this but I am guessing 12 inches).The materials are heavy duty. I would strongly recommend you follow the installation instructions regarding best practices on mounting. The mount itself did not require any assembly; I bought another "full motion" TV mount 5 years ago and it felt like I needed a degree in Mech Engineering to assemble it. This one was super simple and it is reasonably priced.Great buy. I would buy it again should a need arise elsewhere in the house.
5,Easy to install
5,Solid well made wall mount for TVs.  Flexible mount pattern that should match most any stud spacing.  Included a cardboard pattern to help with layout.  Also included a level and plenty of hardware.My son came over to help and I was lucky since he hung his TV about a month earlier.  He wished he had bought a Mounting Dream instead of the one he did.  Easy mounting and flexibility with adjustments for viewing were the things he liked the most.  Me too actually.Mine is holding a 75" TV and is solid.  Follow the directions and you should have an easy time mounting.  Would buy again.
5,The product works great! Easy to install and holds my 75 inch TV great. Swivels well and it does move back against the wall very close.I also want to point out how happy I have been with Mounting Dream. I had a little problem with a piece I lost and they replaced it very quickly. I am very impressed! Thank you!!!
5,I would recommend this to anyone great mount
5,I mounted this to a concrete wall in my basement. It's built like a tank as far as I can tell. I have a 65" TV mounted to it. I saw another reviewer that complained about the bracket not being square or level...there are 2 spots in the back of the plate so you adjust the overall level of the TV. It wasn't defective like they claimed. It was user error. The point is even if you don't get the mount on the wall exactly level you can adjust the level of the TV.
5,I have purchased two of these. And it is a awesome mount. Mounted a 77" LG C1 and a 50" Samsung  without a single issue. Have a ton of adjustment points. Incase you are like me and don't get it perfect because it is very well built and pretty heavy. Weighs more than either of my tvs I think lol. 10/10 I have zero concerns about swinging my 77" around with this mount.
3,I just finished installing an 85” Samsung Q70A using this bracket.  The install went OK expect for the folding in and out which is very stiff.  In fact I can’t get in all the way in with the TV sitting about 3-4 inches from the wall.  Seems like there needs to be an adjustment for loosening the folding mechanism to make it easier to move in and out.  I am afraid that I might damage the panel if I push (or pull) too hard.
5,My new 65 inch tv
5,I guess it worked
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Strong very professional
5,Very sturdy supporting my 78 pound TV. My Vizio has non standard mounting holes. This mount accommodates a wide variety of configurations so I can put a different t TV o on it later.
5,The install is relatively easy in that what you are doing is simple but you do need an extra set of hands. The templates and instructions are very good. Find studs and drill. I do not care for the screws provided. The Phillips head strips really easily for the torque required to drive them in. I recommend using a hex drive instead. Otherwise the tilting and rigidity of the system are fantastic. The small cable management clips are a nice touch as well to keep things cleaned up. Definitely a fan of this mount
5,In the past 2 months I've hung 17 TV's. I ordered this I've for my personal TV after using this brand for a friend's TV. The ease of installation and build quality are amazing....
5,Bought this to install my 55 inch vizio tv to the wall so that I can have the tv higher than my previous tv stand solution. Easy to mount.  Kit included level template all mounting hardware and it is very sturdy. Installation too me about 1 hour by myself as it took me time to find the studs but it has a wide range of mounting  holes to accommodate 16 and 24 inch on center studs.
5,From the questions to the seller to receipt of the item was a great experience.  The mount fit my old TV perfectly.  Easy to install.  Very sturdy build for a heavy TV.
4,It was a breeze to install and strong enough to trust in holding up my 75” TV.
5,This is heavy duty TV wall mount. It came with everything you need to install. You do need a couple of tools but it had the correct drill bit for the in closed lag bolts. I have learned buying less expensive wall mounts are not the way to go. This has a good price. I mounted an 80 inch TV and mount works great.
5,This was by far one of the best TV wall mounts I've ever installed. Not only was it easy to install and super sturdy it came with a template so you know where to put the holes without holding the mount up itself or measuring and guessing. Overall it's a great mount I put it up myself but would be easier with two people.
5,I mounted my 75" TV to the wall with this mount and I couldn't be happier with it. The provided hardware is great and instructions easy to follow. I measured everything out before drilling any holes and it all went up fairly quickly. The TV is as easy to reposition as could be expected for a 90+ lbs screen and I feel comfortable that the mount will keep it on the wall securely. Would buy again.
5,No problems at all mounting a 75" Samsung with this mount.  Got lucky with the studs so it was a simple screw-in proposition.  If I were to ding it at all it's the tilt mechanism. Adding some interference to the slide mechanism to keep it from drifting (Tilting down) shouldn't be all that hard.  Other than that it's good possibly great value for the money.
5,Seems very solid.  had to install on wall with metal studs. instructions are for wood studs or concrete.arms are pretty stiff.  template worked well.
5,sturdyeasy instalation
4,We bought a similar stand a few years back for 3 times the price this one seems to do the job just as well. Its a little hard to maneuver it but all you have to do is loosen the bolts a little bit and its fine. Other than that no complaints and all angles seems to covered. Tools are included and also a little level to make sure its perfect.
4,
5,This wall mount is everything it claims to be. It is sturdy sleek and easy to install. I use it for an outdoor 75” tv and is is amazing!
4,Nothing like all
5,Perfect mount love the different options for stud mounting! Would definitely recommend to others
5,Holds my Samsung 75” well. Range of motion is good even though it just stays same position all the time except to clean behind. I did as another reviewer mentioned I opted to use the 3” lag screws for better piece of mind.
5,I was nervous about hanging my very heavy 65” LG OLED on the wall.  After researching and reading reviews I picked this wall mount.  It was very easy to install and is incredibly sturdy.  No complaints whatsoever.
5,Its sturdy and easy to swivel
5,Easy to install. Guide is well written and hardware is stored in labeled compartments that correspond to the steps. This kit didn’t include the little stick on level that was included in a lighter model. Would make the install a 5 star.VESA mount is easy to use and simple to attach tv to mount securely.
5,I've used mounts from Mounting Dream several times and these days will only buy their mounts.  Everything you need to mount your TV or monitor is included in the package.  They are sturdy and hold position once you have them set where you want..
5,my TV was to care for other mounts thais is the only on e enough and strong enough
5,Didn’t think my 65 inch would be able to be in the air and move like it does
5,Easy to figure out easy to install  very sturdy. Used this to mount a 75 inch. Took maybe an hour start to finish but we were being very cautious. Large range of motion on a very large tv
5,No combination of spacers was applicable to my TV 2017 QlED Samsung. Had to figure out my own fix to mount the TV brackets. And contacting support isn't worth the few day wait.
1,I bought this based on the highly rated reviews…However it didn’t meet the expectations.  The range of motion was acceptable but the TV would never remain straight.  Looking at it when sitting on the sofa one can easily see the height discrepancy.  And I had a professional installer mount it.  Tried for over 2 hours and it would not remain aligned.  Ended going to Best Buy and purchasing another brand and it was perfect!!!  Maybe I had a defective unit but unsure…I wouldn’t purchase again.
5,It was simple enough to install. I bought 2 of these one for a 75" qled and another for 55" quick tip for the 75" tv I bought the 85" mount and for the 55" tv I bought the 65" mount they both feel very secure!
4,Used for LG 55" Class - CX Series - 4K UHD OLED TV
5,I hung an 82” tv and it went well
5,Solid unit…SOLID. Easy to install stays where you put it and doesn’t wiggle at all. Mounting Dream will be my go-to brand going forward. A SOLID product.
5,ive purchased about 4-5 of  mounting dreams products and have regretted using a single one. The name says it all.  Great mounts simple to set up
5,Great mount! Fit my 75" Samsung LED. Seems very sturdy. The HDMI cable that came with us was a nice plus as well. The installation was nice and fast.
5,It's a great product & it was easy to install. I especially liked the fact that it comes with a cardboard template which makes mistakes less likely to happen.
5,Just took two people to hang an 85inch Samsung tv. Just follow the instructions. Overall easy to install and sturdy well made product.
5,Awesome tv mount with good movement capabilities.
5,Holds great and was easy enough to do by one person standards.
5,Very simple install. nice that it comes with all the different possible hardware you would need for different TVs comes with the lag bolts and a pilot hole drill bit. seems very high quality.
5,Awesome rack holds my 86” up and very flexible
4,its easy to install and they give different varieties of spacer and screws.
5,This is a heavy duty rig. Definitely worth it.
5,easier than most to install we have 2. One has a 65 and the other has a 75 inch TV mounted.
3,Works fine but difficult to install. Took over half an hour with an experienced installer.
5,Well built and easy to install. Returned my static cheetah mount due to sagging this thing is sturdy.
5,Love the product. Comes with template to make drilling the holes for mount auper simple.
5,It was a solid mount that was easy to pit together and offered all of the options I wanted.
5,Awesome TV mount!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Its so worth it
5,Easy to install I didn’t even read the menuI can readjust the uneven level after all the installation
5,Great product easy install and easy to maneuver
5,Muy bueno el producto
5,If was great for my new 75inch tv
5,Very happy with purchase.
5,Super easy setup. Range of motion is great. Very solid unit.
5,Mounted  my 75 inch Samsung TV on the wall.
5,Meets and exceeds all expectations!
5,Easy to install already comes out together.
5,Works as described it’s heavier
5,Works great. Was easy to install .
5,Solid mount and easy to install.
1,When we opened the box the bag was full of rust and the portion of the mount that was exposed was bumpy with corrosion. Maybe it had been returned? No idea if the mount would work well; we packed it back up immediately and returned it.If this is indicative of their quality control I would not buy this. I ordered another brand.
1,I received a box of loose screws with a scratched mount and no instructions. Paying top dollar for a new mount and receiving this is a joke.
5,Very sturdy well-made product the customer service was phenomenal. I had lost some screws for this product during one of my moves to my new house and they sent me four new screws free. Definitely impressed with a customer service and when I need to hang another TV in my house this is the brand I will most definitely use.
5,I need an angling mount for a 2007 Philips 55" that weighs 117lbs.This is the one!
5,Second one I installed in 6-months: got a new tv and bought this one to hold more weight.  This Mounting Dream unit was much easier to install.  Recommend!
5,For the money this can't be beat. Actually it is hard to imagine anything at any price that is better built than this. This thing is a tank! Long story short I mounted an 85" Sony X900H TV to my wall using this mount. This particular set weighs 100 lbs. Though the Mounting Dream TV Wall Mount is rated to 132lbs I was concerned about fully extending it from the wall given the leverage that would be placed on mount. No worries. If anything the lag screws or your wall will give out before this mount will. One of the things that steered me to this product was the sellers confidence in it. I just hung a $2500 TV on my wall and I too have confidence it will stay. The provided template was also a big help. I used a laser level and a stud finder to true it up before mounting. Big help. One suggestion is to make sure everything is tightened up before hanging your TV. Mine tiled down on me when trying to move it. Also the TV came out of level before I figured out I had to tighten those screws too. Overall I am very pleased with this product. Very sturdy mount for a ridiculously low price.
5,I bought this for use with a 65" Sony X900H and it worked perfectly. I really had no issues following the directions (it helps that most of what you're doing is actually logical anyway).The included template (and small level) made drilling the holes into the wall studs very easy. The instructions say the 7/32" drill bit for the studs isn't included but it actually was. I didn't need it but was a nice surprise.  Attaching the mount to the TV itself was simple and every variation of screws and spacers you might need seems to be included.The mount itself is very sturdy once mounted on the studs. I have my TV pretty much always a few inches out and it holds there perfectly. I've had no concerns and it's very easy to adjust.The official Sony mount for this TV is more flush to the wall which is cool if that's what you're going for. It's also over $300. By comparison this is a bargain. Glad I grabbed it.
5,Very nice mount fits my 82in LG no problems. So far it's very sturdy and has some flexibility with the tilt and angle to get it straight and looking right. I was just going to get a regular mount with tolt but so glad I got this one as you can move the screen around some which came in handy for the glare during the daytime. Very easy to assemble and came with everything you need. The added template also made drilling the holes easy once you line up the studs. Overall very satisfied with this mount.
5,This mount worked perfect for our tv. Easy to mount and has held the tv as promised.
5,I think there are more likes then dislikes. I'm sure like every item or every person in the world you will have some issues because we're all imperfect. So what am I looking for consistency in the quality of the item which was advertised. I think I am getting that
5,Very easy to install need 2 people in order to do so. Direction were clear and easy to follow. Sturdy and secure
5,Shockingly easy to install.  I am mediocrely handy so this seemed daunting at first.  I read the instructions and they're super easy.  Having a drill is a requirement but otherwise very impressed with quality and ease of install.Installed a 55" LG TV with an added sound bar under mount
5,Worked great easy to setup
5,Be sure your attaching it to the 2x4 on center of each in the wall.  The base gives a wide variety of options to attach it.  Think it through. Get a good stud finder.
5,Bought for my husband he likes it
5,Easy to install
5,Very good
5,Was easy to install came with everything you need to put it up.
5,I was hesitant to use a wall mount for our 85” TV but am very pleased with the sturdiness of this wall mount.
5,The media could not be loaded.
5,It's so worth it. I did change the lag bolts based on another review but the handyman said they were fine during the install. It's a little stiff in motion but you want something to hold it in place.
5,This TV wall mount appears to be of the strength and proper construction needed to hold securely a 85” flat screen.All of the functions it can do make the flat screen viewing easy.
5,Good product
5,This is the easiest to install. Very sturdy.Reasonabley priced.  Love it.
5,Great product
5,Used for a 70in Sharp Quatro(~115lbs). Took about 45mins to install the mount solo. I also used 4 drywall bolts that were suggested by an installer(pic below). Will def be getting one for my smaller 42in. Highly recommend!
5,So I got this brand again cause I used it for a 70 inch tv and it was easy to install and has a variety of motion. This one here that I got is holding an LG 86 inch tv and it’s doing a great job. Plus all the angles and the swivel motion is great.
5,Instructions were straight forward. The complications in my case related to the exactness required. I wanted the Samsung 65” TV - including the mounted sound bar - centered both horizontally and vertically which required quite a bit of math. I also purchased the sound bar mount from the same company which worked very well.The TV is difficult to pull out and push back in so I may have to look at some options to fine tune the settings but overall I’m very happy with the quality of my purchase.
5,This is so sturdy holding up out 85" TV. It is easy to pull it out from the wall to plug chords in the back and easy to adjust to just the right angle for viewing anywhere in the room
5,Installation was a breeze works great. Look no further for other mounts. This is it.
5,This wall mount is very well made!I did a bit of research prior to purchasing this model. I wanted to make sure I bought a mount thay would be compatible with my current TV but also future TVs that I bought.This mount sure fits the bill. I will say that not matter what mount you purchase there's no way to get around having to inatall it... if you're not comfortable with that then I'd suggest hiring a handyman (or woman!) to do it for you.The install process was pretty easy overall but it did help to ha e a second set of hands. The important part is finding your studs and making sure the mount is set up nice and level.The range of motion is great on this mount even when you have it 25% extended which is where I typically leave it.I would recommend this mount if you need something that is study moves smoothly and can handle large TVs!
5,This was my second mount from "Mounting Dream" because the first one I brought was easy to install. It comes with instructions and all the necessary hardware. There will be extra hardware left over due to their anticipation of mounting to different surfaces and situations.
5,Pretty good system.. a bit hard to install here and there but not bad if you know what kind of walls you got. Two people is best.
5,Cuenta con instrucciones fáciles de interpretar
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Me ha gustado
5,El producto está de excelente calidad ya es el segundo que compro. Bastante resistente.
5,Coloque una pantalla de 75 y la carga sin problema.
5,Muy buena mucho mejor que las nacionales y casi al mismo precio tu pantalla queda mas segura y tienes la opcion de grirarla sus componenetes son los mejores que he visto mi panatalla es de 90' y es muy pesada y la base no resiente el peso en absoluto es la mejor base que he tenido
