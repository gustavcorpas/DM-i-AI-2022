4,This is a decent ring light for indoor use!  I‚Äôve tried three different ring lights so far ‚Äî I use them for video self-recording and also for small item product photography.  I specify that this is for indoor use because it is of fairly light plastic construction (I didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúcheap‚Äù) and I‚Äôm just not sure it would hold up under field conditions for you outdoor photographers.  Also the light needs a power source as it is NOT battery operated.PROS: It‚Äôs got everything you need; tripod ring light with adjustable brightness and color temperature cell-phone tripod mount AC adapter and a remote control that you can pair with your phone.  The tripod adjustments feel solid and work easily and the setup was simple.CONS: Light-grade plastic construction may be an issue with long-term use. Must be plugged in (not really a CON unless you intended to use it remotely somewhere).Summary:  If you need an inexpensive ring light for indoor use this would be a good choice. Treat it well and it should last a long time.
5,I use this for bridal makeup and it provides so much light in all spaces! It helps me to make sure everything is even on both sides and gives me the most beautiful ‚Äúafter‚Äù pictures! Would purchase again. Easy to travel with and easy to set up. The only thing I need now is a case to put it in!
5,Me encanto es super liviano cambia de luz fria a calida y lo mejor es que alumbra perfecto!! Tiene bastante potencia y me parece de excelente calidad es super facil de utilizar!
5,Light weight could be a little brighter - but for the price absolutely worth it for an entry level ring light with tripod.
5,It worked good for the first week but after a week one of the leg just drops and shrinks itself so i have to keep adjusting it and it won‚Äôt stay up. The brightness is okay. I would Just spend the money on a better one to begin with don‚Äôt waste your money.
5,The light is easy to use and delivers the perfect light for product demo and videos.
5,Great ring light for the price. Works perfectly for use with Facebook Live.
5,Could be a little bit durable but it is a great product for the price!
5,It‚Äôs definitely a good light for the price it has done well
5,My pictures now have more quality
5,This light is awesome! Captures the best moments.
5,Very sturdy and quick shipping. Awesome product
4,This ring light is very inexpensive so you can't expect it to compare with a high end tripod but does the job.
5,Great value for money. Pictures are very clear and clean. Easy set-up. Love the different lighting selection. I got the 14 inch. Connected very easy and quickly to my Samsung phone. I would definitely recommend üëå
5,This is my very first ring light! I like to use this for makeup session! You can adjust the brightness mode and see which one you prefer. Definitely recommend this ring light for other people to buy it. This is affordable as well.
5,Product is the best lighting I have used yet. Almost fits an iPad and many options. I mainly use it for online auctions
5,This ring light is exactly what I needed. The tripod is surprisingly sturdy which is good because when my phone is attached it makes the entire ring light top heavy. The bluetooth button is a nice touch since I can start recording without touching the phone. Also changing the temperature of the light is a nice addition since I can modify the white balance based on my film set.
5,its about 14 inch size seems like good enough for headshot. Press one of the button can change it from warm to cool white. Press + - can change brightness. The whole package is pretty light. Could be good for traveling. The tripod can fit in the square shaped cardbox. Comes with a tripod mount that can hold your cellphone for selfie.
5,I love that this ring light is bright and stands very tall. It has different light modes you can change from. There‚Äôs a handle to rotate the the ring light. I‚Äôm really happy i purchased this ring light. It‚Äôs light weight and can easily be pit together.
5,I use it for putting my makeup onand taking pictures this is a good bright light...love it.
5,I got my order today and y‚Äôall it was east to put together!!! Light has different lighting settings‚Ä¶. You can move around the phone holster (definitely couldn‚Äôt do that with my last ring lights) the remote even came with a battery!!!! The tripod stand is amazing and very sturdy. I‚Äôm so I love with this!!! If any one was to ask my opinion on what ring light to buy it would definitely be this one!!!!!
5,Great quality love the way it has different shades of lighting and different levels of brightness! I have a lot of fun with it. It‚Äôs super easy to set up and the remote connects very easily and there are no interruptions between the connections like some other ring lights I‚Äôve tried. The ring is a big size which is great to capture more in the photo which I loved the most! Love this product!!!

5,Exactly what my daughter needed for tiktok videos
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Love this light! It's nice and big so it provides plenty of light. The buttons to power on change the lighting tone/color and brightness are all directly under the phone mount. It's very easy to use and the swivel is very helpful too. The Bluetooth remote connects to your phone quick and easy which makes it nice to capture photos and videos from a distance. Happy with this purchase!
3,I needed bright lighting for photos. Just not bright enough for me.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†The delivery arrived ahead of time because initially it was supposed to be here on Sunday but it got here on Thursday but the phone holder arrived dettached and I can‚Äôt use it. Even though it got here ahead of time it‚Äôs broken
1,Light is not bright at all and very flimsy
5,The remote they pack with every tripod makes using these things even easier. I keep it in the car in case I want to take a picture.I want to try what this one with lights can do. I'm not a pro but check out my videos using this tripod. I turned my bedroom into a studio lol
1,This product is very bad. The seller sent me an email requesting a 5-star review in exchange for $15.  The product is BAD.
