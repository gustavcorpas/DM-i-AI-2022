5,We ran into a shipping error on my order... so I contacted the distributor directly.  MIKE - was amazing he figured out what happened in an instant and had everything fixed in coordinated within 24 hours.  It's hard to find companies that will follow up with problems when you order via AMAZON... But let me tell you MIKE went above and beyond.  I feel like a have a new friend.  As far as the product goes it is exactly what I ordered and works perfectly.  I highly recommend this distributor.
